Despite significant advances in\nmemory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems\nstill have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or\nreflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated\nerrors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory\nIntelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent\nsystems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for\nlongitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather\nthan passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,\nhuman-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured\ncapture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system\ncapability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this\nvision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift\ndetection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into\nsystems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,\njudgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in\ncurrent AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating\nintelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially\nresponsible is presented through CMI.

To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a\ncontrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the\ntask and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of\ntask-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated\nand fed into the next layer.

These\nmechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded\nrepresentations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.\n  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO\ndemonstrate that ours\n  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in\ntraining cost of less than 15%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u53d7\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u9690\u79d8\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u9c81\u68d2\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u81f3\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u523015%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u6280\u672f\u901a\u5e38\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u5168\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fee\u6539\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6216\u6838\u5fc3LLM\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u672a\u77e5\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u76ee\u6807\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u6838\u5fc3\u6743\u91cd\u6216\u653b\u51fb\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u8ba4\u8bc1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5bf9\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff1a(1) \u8f93\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u7834\u574f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u865a\u5047\u63d0\u793a\uff1b(2) \u5f02\u5e38\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u4e0e\u540e\u95e8\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5c16\u9510\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Flickr30k\u548cMSCOCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e03\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u523015%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9c81\u68d2\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u6838\u5fc3\u6743\u91cd\u6216\u653b\u51fb\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

These\ndevices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a\nsubstantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated\nadversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance\nmodel robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently\nproduces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and\nheterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently\npersonalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication\nchallenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose\n\\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework\ndesigned to deliver customized defense models for each client through a\ntwo-phase process. In Phase 1, \\textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local\nadversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while\ndrastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters\nduring federated aggregation.

For Code, see\n  https://github.com/SeroneySun/LpLA_code", "summary": "With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder\nmodels have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a\npivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their\nwidespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data\nprivacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats\nposed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing\non contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal\nthe significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy\nleakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction\nperformance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,\nthis paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the\np-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack\n(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical\ndistribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental\nresults across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA\noutperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly\nunder limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers\nthe potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but\nalso provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder\nmodels. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks\nassociated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the\nimportance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy.

We show that an optimized jamming signal can cause a 50% error\nrate with attacker-to-victim ratios as low as -30dB (far less power than\ntraditional jamming) and demonstrate successful identity forgery during\nspoofing attacks, with an attacker successfully removing their own\ntransmitter's fingerprint from messages.

Therefore, PrivTru calculates the minimal amount of information the\ndata trustee needs to request from data sources to respond to a given query.\nOur analysis shows that PrivTru minimizes information leakage to the data\ntrustee, regardless of the trustee's prior knowledge, while preserving the\nutility of the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPrivTru\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6258\u7ba1\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u6700\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PrivTru\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u6258\u7ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u6700\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "result": "PrivTru\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u81f3\u6570\u636e\u6258\u7ba1\u65b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u6258\u7ba1\u65b9\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "PrivTru\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9075\u5faa\u9690\u79c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6258\u7ba1\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

Several creative tactics\nto exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent\ndisclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was\ndriven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination,\ninfluenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The\nincreased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people\ngrappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal\ninformation online or not.

Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)\nare widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing\nmethods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via\nonline attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding\nretraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to\ncapture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a\nframework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies\nsample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's\ngeneralization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong\nperformance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation\nfor approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow\nmodel.

First, they\noverwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal\ncomplexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on\nmathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning\nskills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal\ncapabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many\nbenchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure\nmodes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal\nReasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully\nscripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning\ncategories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic\nPython scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and\ncurated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control\nover visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling\ndifficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static\nbenchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:\nits controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily\nchallenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing\nnext-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --\nincluding various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest\navailable at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal\nsubstantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large\ndeficits in abstract and planning tasks.

The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not\ndesigned for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated\nenvironments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the\nchallenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions\nand device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting\nand degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a\nnovel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion\nmechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,\nFedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally\nseparating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained\nrepresentations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks\nto clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.\nThis enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated\nenvironments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive\nexperiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,\nFedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after\nfine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without\ndegrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedBE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Transformer\u5757\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5757\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4e5f\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedBE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5757\u5c06\u65b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cFedBE\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8612-74%\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.9-3.1\u500d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "FedBE\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u6784\u8054\u90a6\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local\nregions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract\nsuch correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations\nare available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in\nphase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation\nanalysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be\noverlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These\ncorrelation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to\nthe discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector\nfield in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently\nrepresenting spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our\napproach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and\nforecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4ecd\u7136\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u76f8\u90bb\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8868\u793a\u5728\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u62df\u5408\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76f8\u90bb\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5bfb\u627e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8868\u793a\u5728\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u3002\u5f53\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff08PDF\uff09\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4ee3\u8868\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u53e0\u52a0\u5728PDF\u56fe\u4e0a\u5f62\u6210\u76f8\u90bb\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u90bb\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3a\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b0\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5438\u5f15\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u90bb\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u62df\u5408\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

To address this complexity, we introduce the\nbargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and\nwell-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable\nproperties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction\nbetween two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational\nadvantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the\nstandard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the\ngame structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,\nthereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information\nbargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage\nvalidation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and\nDeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We\nthen apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with\nwhat our information-bargaining framework suggests.

Extending the reasoning\nchain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can\nfurthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the\nexplosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and\ncan be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This\nmotivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying\ncapacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task\ndecomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To\naddress this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables\ncollaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing\nsub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a\nReinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.\nThe task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered\nsubtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most\nappropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing\naccuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline\nthat combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group\nRelative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement\nthrough iterative reinforcement learning.

In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed\nPSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the\nmathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate\nsolutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy\nmanagement problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to\nenergy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of\nconcept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of\npredictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN\nmodel based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for\nPSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training\nusing far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training\ndistribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,\nthe PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a\nsecond for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of\nstochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for\nsimulations and long term planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u90e8\u5206\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PSNN\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff08mp-QP\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPSNN\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u90e8\u5206\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PSNN\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "result": "PSNN\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff1a1) \u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b2) \u9762\u5bf9\u6781\u7aef\u3001\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b3) \u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "PSNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Of these, we have performed an in-depth\nanalysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by\ncitizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and\n-validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter\ntests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new\neclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we\nupdate the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the\ntargets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially\ninteresting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and\nunvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features\nwith a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing\nbinaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).", "AI": {"tldr": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) surveyed the entire sky and detected variable stars, especially short-period eclipsing binaries.

In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected\nto the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled\nby a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this\npaper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be\ndifferent. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should\nbe injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new\nframework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).\nSpecifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data\npoint deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms).

To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical\nhyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP\nhyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series.
