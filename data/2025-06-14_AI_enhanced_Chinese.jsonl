When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then\noffers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of\nunderdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The\ndiscussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape\nevaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The\nconclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the\ninequality for the future of trustworthy AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a conjecture that there is a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in AI systems.

To bridge this\ngap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate\ngraph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel\nmetrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling\na comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive\nexperiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal\ntrade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting\nlimitations in existing AL strategies.

However, it faces\npractical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must\nbe transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR\ndevice's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed\nand delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and\nworsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic\nCommunication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service\n(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic\ntransmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction.

However, IOCs\ntend to be short-lived as they are easy to change. As a result, the\ncybersecurity community is shifting focus towards more persistent behavioral\nprofiles, such as the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and the\nsoftware used by a threat group. However, the distinctiveness and completeness\nof such behavioral profiles remain largely unexplored. In this work, we\nsystematically analyze threat group profiles built from two open cyber threat\nintelligence (CTI) knowledge bases: MITRE ATT&CK and Malpedia. We first\ninvestigate what fraction of threat groups have group-specific behaviors, i.e.,\nbehaviors used exclusively by a single group. We find that only 34% of threat\ngroups in ATT&CK have group-specific techniques. The software used by a threat\ngroup proves to be more distinctive, with 73% of ATT&CK groups using\ngroup-specific software. However, this percentage drops to 24% in the broader\nMalpedia dataset. Next, we evaluate how group profiles improve when data from\nboth sources are combined. While coverage improves modestly, the proportion of\ngroups with group-specific behaviors remains under 30%.

In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for\nsupervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have\ndifferent skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate\nclassifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,\nsufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,\nthe proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.\nThe proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a\nneural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a\ntask-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent\nspace.

To facilitate our study\nof monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse\ndataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic\ntasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%\nattack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition\nattack is broadly effective.

To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a\nPyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine\nlearning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows.

The framework is\nbuilt on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,\ngoverned by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.\n  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model\nthat predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent\nstrain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby\novercoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,\nHANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to\ncapture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we\nembed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale\nfeature extraction.\n  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial\nhidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in\nrecurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling\nstress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed\ninput-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations\nand exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular\nsampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate\nHANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive\nanisotropic damage in brittle solids.

Previous\nwork~\\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have\nthe potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is\nneeded to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the\nreliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs\nare used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we\nexamine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are\nused for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in\nevaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.\nWe further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects\nmodel. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation\nresults obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for\ne.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as\nsignificant in comparing relative system performance.

Recent developments have\ngiven rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,\nthat achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural\nquestion: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that\nsupport near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space\nsequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --\nstate space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the\nclassic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation\noperator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),\nby relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially\nnon-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization\nunifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)\nand linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new\nmodels with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per\ntoken and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such\nmodels on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic\ntasks, including state tracking and associative recall.

In particular, it\nintegrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified\ndeep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of\nspatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction\nprocess, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics\nin cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization\nmechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing\nsymmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets\ndemonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in\npreserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization\ncapability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DUN-SRE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001MRI\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7(2+1)D\u7b49\u53d8\u5377\u79ef\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u7acb\u65f6\u7a7a\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5fc3\u810fCINE MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ECNN\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u52a8\u6001MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u5c55\u5f00\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DUN-SRE\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7(2+1)D\u7b49\u53d8\u5377\u79ef\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8fd1\u7aef\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6df1\u5c55\u5f00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7fa4\u6ee4\u6ce2\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u8868\u793a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5fc3\u810fCINE MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDUN-SRE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DUN-SRE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u7a7a\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u52a8\u6001MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u52a8\u6001MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention.

NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software\necosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly\nalleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of\nuser programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem\nhas established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This\ndominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with\nperformance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms\nposes significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming\nparadigms and hardware architectures.

While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study\nexamines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from\ndyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level\nprosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions\n(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker\ndisplacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness\nshowed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed\ngestures during overlaps.

To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption\nHallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,\nsynthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image\ncaptions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual\ndescription error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or\nspatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the\nimage and the modified caption.

Traditional computational\nfluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed\nconvergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring\nprohibitive computational costs.

Hybrid physics-aware\nmethods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss\nfunctions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing\ncoarse priors against high-fidelity measurements.

Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit\nsolution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the\nsampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data\ndistribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a\nspecific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses\nregions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength\n$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.\nNotably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We\nalso show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation\n($\\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for\nboth $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in\nshaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the\nsampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that\nillustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
