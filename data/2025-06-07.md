### [1] [Zero-Shot Adaptation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04244)
*Farzad Farhadzadeh,Debasmit Das,Shubhankar Borse,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProLoRA enables zero-shot adaptation for transferring pre-trained low-rank adjustments from a source to a target text-to-image model without additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional methods that require retraining when switching base models, which is often challenging due to data constraints.

Method: ProLoRA transfers pre-trained low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model by projecting source adjustments into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers.

Result: Evaluations on established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and comparable performance without retraining.

Conclusion: ProLoRA successfully enables zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在自主代理人为用户做决策的时代，确保情境完整性（CI）成为关键问题。本文提出CI需要代理对操作环境进行推理，并通过提示大语言模型（LLM）显式推理CI以及开发强化学习框架来实现这一目标。使用约700个样例的合成数据集，该方法显著减少了不恰当的信息披露，同时保持任务性能，并且效果可迁移到如PrivacyLens等基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理人为用户做决策的时代到来，确保情境完整性（CI）成为关键问题，即在执行特定任务时，分享哪些信息是合适的。这需要代理对操作环境进行推理。

Method: 首先提示大语言模型（LLM）显式推理CI以决定披露哪些信息，然后开发强化学习（RL）框架进一步将实现CI所需的推理能力灌输给模型。使用一个约700个样例的合成数据集，该数据集具有多样化的上下文和信息披露规范。

Result: 该方法显著减少了不恰当的信息披露，同时保持了任务性能。并且，这种改进可以从合成数据集迁移到已建立的CI基准测试，例如具有人工注释的PrivacyLens，它评估AI助手在动作和工具调用中的隐私泄漏情况。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在减少不恰当信息披露方面表现良好，同时不影响任务完成效果，并且其效果可以成功迁移到其他基准数据集上。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

### [3] [Language-Guided Multi-Agent Learning in Simulations: A Unified Framework and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04251)
*Zhengyang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-MARL, a framework integrating large language models into multi-agent reinforcement learning. It shows improvements in coordination and generalization through subgoal generation and language-based messaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in multi-agent reinforcement learning by incorporating large language models.

Method: A unified framework named LLM-MARL with three modular components (Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory) is developed. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating.

Result: Consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization are shown in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations by bridging language modeling and policy learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

### [4] [A Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework Enhances Decision-Making in the Circular Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04252)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Dusit Niyato,Chuan Fu Tan,Keyi Xiang,Yueyang Wang,Zhiquan Yeo,Daren Tan Zong Loong,Jonathan Low Zhaozhi,Eugene H. Z. HO*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG is a RAG framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific knowledge graph for the circular economy, improving accuracy and efficiency in answering industrial and waste-related queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, which can undermine regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: CircuGraphRAG uses a knowledge graph connecting industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission data. Natural language queries are translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy and traceability.

Result: CircuGraphRAG achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering, with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, compared to baseline scores below 0.08. It also improves efficiency by halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16% in representative tasks.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource decision making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

### [5] [HADA: Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04253)
*Tapio Pitkäranta,Leena Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HADA, a reference architecture ensuring alignment of LLMs and traditional algorithms with organizational goals and ethics. It uses stakeholder agents for control and auditing, provides a cloud-native proof of concept in credit scoring, and contributes an open-source architecture, design theory, and empirical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a system where both modern LLMs and legacy algorithms are aligned with organizational targets and values, addressing the need for accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance in decision-making pipelines.

Method: Developed HADA, which wraps algorithms or LLMs in role-specific stakeholder agents (business, data-science, audit, ethics, customer). These agents expose conversational APIs allowing various actors to query, steer, audit, or contest decisions. Alignment objectives and constraints are expressed in natural language and continuously logged. A cloud-native proof of concept was created using a production credit-scoring model deployed on Docker/Kubernetes/Python, tested with five retail-bank scenarios.

Result: Evaluation through Design-Science Research Methodology showed complete coverage of six predefined objectives: conversational control across roles, tracing KPIs and value constraints, bias detection/mitigation, and reproducibility of decision lineage, independent of underlying models or libraries.

Conclusion: HADA offers an open-source architecture contributing to human-AI alignment in multi-agent systems. The research provides mid-range design theory and empirical evidence that framework-agnostic, protocol-compliant stakeholder agents enhance accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance.

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

### [6] [Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and Iterative Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04287)
*Yongjin Yang,Sinjae Kang,Juyong Lee,Dongjun Lee,Se-Young Yun,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces EXIF, an automatic skill discovery framework for LLM-powered agents. It uses an exploration-first strategy with two agents (Alice and Bob) to iteratively generate meaningful skills and improve agent capabilities without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for creating training datasets for LLM agents face challenges such as significant human effort in manual trajectory collection and lack of knowledge about feasible tasks when LLMs directly propose tasks. Additionally, generated data may not provide a meaningful learning signal due to agents already performing well on proposed tasks.

Method: EXIF employs an exploration agent (Alice) to interact with the environment and generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset. This dataset is used to train the target agent (Bob). An iterative feedback loop is incorporated where Alice evaluates Bob's performance to guide the next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process.

Result: Experiments on Webshop and Crafter show that EXIF effectively discovers meaningful skills and iteratively expands the capabilities of the trained agent, leading to substantial performance improvements without any human intervention. Notably, setting Alice to the same model as Bob also improves performance.

Conclusion: EXIF demonstrates the potential for building a self-evolving system by effectively discovering meaningful skills and improving agent capabilities through an iterative, closed-loop data generation process.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

### [7] [A Statistical Physics of Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04374)
*Jack David Carson,Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformer语言模型展示出难以通过机械方式理解的推理能力。本文提出了一种连续时间链式思维推理动态的统计物理学框架，将句子级别的隐状态轨迹建模为低维流形上的随机动力系统，并通过潜态机制转换捕捉不同的推理阶段。实证研究显示，这种模型能够解释约50%的方差，并识别出四种潜在的推理机制。该框架允许低成本地模拟推理过程，并有助于研究和预测关键转变，如错位状态或其他LM失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer语言模型表现出强大的推理能力，但其内部机制难以被理解和解释。因此，需要一个理论框架来更好地理解这些模型的推理动态及其可能的失败模式。

Method: 本文采用统计物理学框架，将句子级别的隐状态轨迹建模为低维流形上的随机动力系统（漂移-扩散系统），并通过潜态机制转换来捕捉不同的推理阶段。此外，作者提出了一个SLDS模型，并通过实证数据对其进行验证。

Result: 通过对8个模型和7个基准的实证分析，发现一个秩为40的投影可以解释约50%的方差，并识别出四种潜在的推理机制。

Conclusion: 所提出的统计物理学框架能够有效地捕捉Transformer语言模型的推理动态，并提供了一种低成本的方法来模拟推理过程，同时也有助于预测模型可能出现的失败模式。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

### [8] [Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410)
*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了一个名为Matter-of-Fact的数据集，用于评估假设的可行性。该数据集包含8400个从高影响力材料科学主题中提取的主张。尽管强大的基线模型未能超过72%的准确率，但领域专家验证表明几乎所有的主张都是可解决的，这表明了加速科学发现的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的辅助科学发现方法可以生成大量的假设和自动实验，但由于自动化实验成本高昂，尤其是在大规模运行时，因此需要一种能力来筛选基于其可行性的假设，以提高重大发现的可能性。

Method: 引入了Matter-of-Fact挑战数据集，其中包括从科学文章中提取的8.4k主张，涵盖了四个当代材料科学主题。这些主张包括定性和定量内容，来源于理论、实验和代码/模拟结果。使用包括检索增强生成和代码生成在内的强大基线模型进行性能测试。

Result: 强基线模型在该任务上的表现未能超过72%（随机表现为50%），而领域专家验证表明几乎所有问题都是可解决的。

Conclusion: 这项工作突显了当前模型在评估假设可行性任务上的困难，并展示了通过近期进展加速科学发现的潜力。

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

### [9] [Plugging Schema Graph into Multi-Table QA: A Human-Guided Framework for Reducing LLM Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04427)
*Xixi Wang,Miguel Costa,Jordanka Kovaceva,Shuai Wang,Francisco C. Pereira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph-based framework for multi-table QA that uses human-curated relational knowledge to encode schema links and join paths, demonstrating effectiveness on complex industrial tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have shown potential in table QA but face challenges in multi-table QA due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables.

Method: The proposed method leverages a graph-based framework with human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. It constructs interpretable reasoning chains from natural language queries, using pruning and sub-path merging strategies for efficiency and coherence.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks and a large-scale realistic dataset show the effectiveness of the approach in handling complex industrial tabular data.

Conclusion: This work presents the first multi-table QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data, marking a significant advancement in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

### [10] [An AI-Based Public Health Data Monitoring System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04429)
*Ananya Joshi,Nolan Gormley,Richa Gadgil,Tina Townes,Roni Rosenfeld,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a ranking-based monitoring paradigm using AI anomaly detection methods to handle large volumes of health data, showing significant improvement over traditional alert-based systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health experts require scalable methods to monitor vast amounts of health data for outbreaks or quality issues. Traditional alert-based systems have limitations such as the need for constant threshold adjustments and potential application lag due to data volume.

Method: The authors developed a ranking-based monitoring system that employs AI anomaly detection techniques through an interdisciplinary collaboration.

Result: The system was deployed at a national organization to monitor up to 5 million data points daily, resulting in a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: This study emphasizes the transformative potential of human-centered AI in enhancing public health decision-making processes.

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

### [11] [Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478)
*Hadi Hosseini,Samarth Khanna,Ronak Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains, focusing on matching markets. It evaluates state-of-the-art models on preference-based reasoning tasks, revealing their limitations in large markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well Large Language Models can handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains such as matching markets, which are essential for applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing.

Method: Evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks related to matching markets, including stable-matching generation, instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries.

Result: Even top-performing LLMs struggle with resolving instability in large markets, failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves performance in small markets but not in large ones.

Conclusion: There is a need for more sophisticated strategies to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities when dealing with larger-context inputs in combinatorial domains.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

### [12] [CogMath: Assessing LLMs' Authentic Mathematical Ability from a Human Cognitive Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04481)
*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Wei Dai,Cheng Cheng,Jinze Wu,Jing Sha,Song Li,Qi Liu,Shijin Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在解决复杂数学任务方面展现出潜力，但现有的评估范式仅依赖于整体答案准确性的粗略度量，不足以评估其真实能力。本文提出CogMath，通过人类认知的视角全面评估LLMs的数学能力。CogMath将人类推理过程形式化为三个阶段：问题理解、问题解决和解决方案总结，并设计了9个精细评估维度。通过在三个基准上应用CogMath，发现7个主流LLMs的数学能力被高估了30%-40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对大型语言模型数学能力的评估方法过于粗糙，无法准确反映模型的真实能力。

Method: 受心理学理论启发，提出CogMath框架，将人类推理过程分为三个阶段并设计9个细粒度评估维度，使用多代理系统生成评估问询以全面评估LLMs的数学能力。

Result: 通过对三个基准的实验，发现主流LLMs的数学能力被显著高估，并且定位了它们在特定阶段/维度上的优势和劣势。

Conclusion: CogMath提供了一种更全面和细致的方法来评估LLMs的数学能力，揭示了现有模型的能力高估情况，并为改进其推理能力提供了深入见解。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

*Aladin Djuhera,Amin Seffo,Masataro Asai,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes STPR, a framework that uses LLMs to translate complex natural language constraints into executable Python functions for robotic navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of translating complex spatial, mathematical, and conditional constraints expressed in natural language into a formal description that can be used by planning algorithms in robotic navigation.

Method: STPR leverages LLMs' coding capabilities to convert 'what not to do' instructions into Python functions. These functions describe constraints accurately, even complex mathematical ones, and are applied to point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms.

Result: Experiments in a simulated Gazebo environment demonstrate that STPR ensures full compliance across various constraints and scenarios with short runtimes. It is also effective when using smaller, code-specific LLMs at low inference cost.

Conclusion: STPR successfully translates complex natural language constraints into executable functions for robotic navigation, ensuring compliance and efficiency while being adaptable to different LLM sizes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Motivation: Current agricultural intelligence systems lack contextual understanding, explainability, and adaptability, particularly for smallholder farmers. General-purpose LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge needed for practical farming decision support.

Method: OpenAg integrates: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base; (ii) a neural agricultural knowledge graph; (iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system; and (iv) a causal transparency mechanism to deliver actionable insights.

Result: OpenAg aims to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and farmer expertise, offering scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making support.

Conclusion: By combining domain-specific models, knowledge graphs, multi-agent reasoning, and causal explainability, OpenAg advances agricultural artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

*Li Liu,Heng Yong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeePoly is a novel framework that combines DNNs and polynomial basis functions to solve PDEs with high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for solving PDEs lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes.

Method: DeePoly transforms the solution paradigm into a two-stage approach: first using a DNN to capture complex global features, then employing linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features (Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper).

Result: This approach significantly enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties.

Conclusion: DeePoly leverages the complementary strengths of DNNs and polynomial bases to provide a more efficient and accurate method for solving PDEs.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

### [18] [Look Before You Leap: A GUI-Critic-R1 Model for Pre-Operative Error Diagnosis in GUI Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04614)
*Yuyang Wanyan,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Haowei Liu,Junyang Wang,Jiabo Ye,Yutong Kou,Ming Yan,Fei Huang,Xiaoshan Yang,Weiming Dong,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are used for GUI automation, which requires step-by-step decision-making in online interactive environments. Errors can disrupt the process and lead to irreversible outcomes. To address this, a pre-operative critic mechanism is introduced, specifically the Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy, resulting in the GUI-Critic-R1 model. This model incorporates a suggestion reward to improve feedback reliability. A data collection pipeline was also developed to create GUI-Critic-Train and GUI-Critic-Test datasets. Experiments show that GUI-Critic-R1 has significant advantages in critic accuracy compared to current MLLMs and performs well in both static and dynamic evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI automation tasks require precise step-by-step decision-making in real-time environments, with little tolerance for errors due to potential irreversible consequences. Current approaches lack a mechanism for providing effective feedback prior to execution.

Method: The authors propose a pre-operative critic mechanism using the Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to build the GUI-Critic-R1 model. This model uses a novel suggestion reward to enhance feedback reliability. They also develop a reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to generate GUI-Critic-Train and GUI-Critic-Test datasets.

Result: Static experiments on GUI-Critic-Test across mobile and web domains demonstrate that GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant improvements in critic accuracy over existing MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on a GUI automation benchmark shows enhanced success rates and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: The GUI-Critic-R1 model provides reliable feedback for GUI automation tasks, significantly improving critic accuracy and operational efficiency compared to current MLLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管法律领域是自然语言处理（NLP）应用的重要领域，且推理是法律实践的核心部分，但目前尚无专注于法律推理任务的数据集。因此，研究人员希望填补这一空白，通过创建一个专注于公司治理推理的基准来评估模型的法律推理能力。

Conclusion: CHANCERY基准成功地评估了模型在公司治理推理任务上的表现，证明了其难度以及对高级法律推理能力的需求。研究结果为改进法律推理模型提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents, yet they struggle with coherent long-term strategies. This paper investigates whether LLM agents can self-improve when placed in environments that challenge their strategic planning abilities using the board game Settlers of Catan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based agents still have difficulties in formulating and adhering to coherent long-term strategies. The motivation is to explore if these agents can self-improve in environments that explicitly challenge their strategic planning abilities.

Method: Using the board game Settlers of Catan via the open-source Catanatron framework, a multi-agent architecture is introduced where specialized roles (Analyzer, Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to analyze gameplay, research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. Agents progress from simple game-playing to systems capable of rewriting their own prompts and code.

Result: Self-evolving agents outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations, especially when powered by advanced models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The study concludes that LLM agents can effectively self-improve in strategic environments, showing promising results in diagnosing failure and adapting over time.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Motivation: To address the alignment challenge of honesty in advanced LLMs that may intentionally deceive humans through their reasoning processes.

Method: Using representation engineering to systematically induce, detect, and control deception in CoT-enabled LLMs by extracting 'deception vectors' via Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT).

Result: Achieved 89% detection accuracy for deception and a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: Unveiled specific honesty-related issues in reasoning models and provided tools towards trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related

TL;DR: This paper presents E-bike agents, a framework using LLMs to classify and extract safety variables from unstructured e-bike incident reports. The study found equipment issues are slightly more common than human-related ones but less often fatal. A model achieved a high weighted F1 score of 0.87.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large

lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to

TL;DR: 通过引入细粒度分析框架，研究强化学习（RL）对语言模型推理能力的影响，发现RL并非主要提升模型执行外部计划的能力，而是增强模型制定和遵循内部策略以及整合知识进行推理的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于强化学习的训练方法在实证上取得了显著成果，但对其优势的具体理解仍然不足，因此需要更细致地分析RL对推理能力的影响。

Method: 提出一个细粒度分析框架，专门研究可能从RL训练中受益的关键元素：计划执行、问题分解、改进推理和知识利用。

Result: 提供明确的分步计划反而会降低模型在最困难基准上的表现，而RL调优的模型表现出更大的鲁棒性；RL增强了模型将给定知识融入推理过程的能力，并在不同任务上提升了性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为更系统地训练和评估推理模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

TL;DR: The Deepseek-R1-Distill reasoning models are popular in the open-source community for their strong performance across various domains. However, benchmark evaluation results of these models experience significant fluctuations due to different factors. Variations in evaluation conditions lead to differing results, a phenomenon also observed in other related models and QwQ-32B, making reliable reproduction of performance improvements difficult.

Result: Observed significant fluctuations in benchmark results due to varying evaluation conditions, affecting the reliability of claimed performance improvements in the studied models.

Conclusion: There is a need for establishing a more rigorous paradigm for evaluating model performance to ensure reliable and consistent results.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant

conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel model-based RL framework that optimizes task performance and safety simultaneously by incorporating an adaptive mechanism to switch between model-based planning and direct policy execution, using implicit world models and dynamic safety thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-based RL approaches struggle with ensuring safety in real-world applications due to model inaccuracies and objective mismatches. There is a need for a method that can reliably balance task performance and safety constraints.

Method: The authors propose a new model-based RL framework that includes: 1) An adaptive switching mechanism between model-based planning and direct policy execution to handle model errors; 2) Use of implicit world models to address the objective mismatch problem; 3) Dynamic safety thresholds that adjust according to the agent's evolving capabilities.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements over non-adaptive methods in diverse safety-critical continuous control tasks, demonstrating the ability to optimize both safety and performance beyond just meeting minimum safety requirements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully achieves robust performance on various safety-critical tasks, outperforming existing methods and showing promise for real-world applications requiring both high performance and stringent safety standards.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

*Julien Soulé,Jean-Paul Jamont,Michel Occello,Paul Théron,Louis-Marie Traonouez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper uses Markovian modeling and simulation to study the interactions between cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents in a networked system, providing an experimental framework for coordinated cyber-attack scenarios and assessing defenders' dynamic organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As cyber-attacks become increasingly complex and coordinated, there is a need for effective strategies involving multi-agent approaches for cyber-defense near entry points in network systems.

Method: The paper employs Markovian modeling and implements simulations with cyber-attacker and cyber-defender agents on host network nodes. Network nodes are abstracted by sets of properties including agents' ones. Actions by agents determine how the network reacts in given states and what properties change. The collective choice of actions affects proximity to attackers' and defenders' goals.

Result: A realistically inspired scenario was implemented using several behavior implementation approaches for both cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers within the simulator.

Conclusion: The experimental framework provides valuable insights into implementing realistic coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while evaluating the effectiveness of cyber-defenders' dynamic organizations.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

*Jônata Tyska Carvalho,Stefano Nolfi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使大型语言模型（LLMs）能够通过直接将连续观测向量映射到连续动作向量来控制具身智能体的方法。该方法在多个经典控制任务中验证了其有效性，成功找到了最优或高性能的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多强化学习方法依赖于大量数据和计算资源，且难以结合符号知识与子符号感知运动数据。为了解决这些问题，提出了一种新方法，利用LLMs生成控制策略并将其与感知运动数据结合。

Method: 首先，LLMs根据智能体、环境及目标的文字描述生成初始控制策略。然后，通过不断提供性能反馈和感知运动数据，迭代地改进这一策略。最终，通过 Gymnasium 和 MuJoCo 中的经典控制任务验证了该方法的有效性。

Result: 该方法在大多数测试任务中成功找到了最优或高性能的解决方案，展示了将符号推理与子符号感知运动数据相结合的能力。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种新的方法，通过LLMs生成和优化控制策略，并结合符号知识与子符号感知运动数据，从而有效解决经典的控制问题。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

*Atahan Karagoz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, which are autonomous systems focused on sustaining themselves through internal energy regulation rather than task performance. It proposes a modular architecture integrating energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into a closed-loop control system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create autonomous systems that can sustain themselves in resource-volatile settings without reliance on external infrastructure or supervision.

Method: The method involves formalizing an energy-based utility function and a viability-constrained survival horizon, and proposing a modular architecture for energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation.

Result: The result is the emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior in a simulated environment without external supervision.

Conclusion: These contributions provide a theoretical and architectural foundation for deploying autonomous agents capable of self-regulated persistence in challenging environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAG-UAV, a framework enhancing LLMs' mathematical reasoning for UAV operations by integrating retrieval of domain-specific knowledge. Evaluated on UAV-Math-Bench, it significantly improves exact answer accuracy and reduces formulation and numerical errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of LLMs in selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing precise multi-step arithmetic for autonomous UAV operations.

Method: Proposed RAG-UAV framework incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to provide LLMs access to relevant UAV domain literature. Evaluated using UAV-Math-Bench, a set of 20 UAV-centric math problems across four difficulty levels.

Result: RAG-UAV increased exact answer accuracy up to 75%, reduced incorrect formulation selection from 25% to 5%, and decreased numerical errors significantly (reducing MSE by orders of magnitude).

Conclusion: RAG-UAV demonstrates potential for enabling general-purpose LLMs as reliable tools for engineering analysis in UAV contexts, though real-time flight control application needs further investigation.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

### [33] [Truly Self-Improving Agents Require Intrinsic Metacognitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05109)
*Tennison Liu,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-improving agents need intrinsic metacognitive learning to overcome limitations in current approaches that are rigid and lack generalization. This involves three components: knowledge, planning, and evaluation. While existing agents rely on extrinsic mechanisms, many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition already exist. Key challenges include distributing responsibilities between humans and agents and robustly evaluating this learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agents face limitations such as rigidity, poor generalization across task domains, and scalability issues with increasing agent capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces a formal framework for intrinsic metacognitive learning comprising three components: metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on experiences to improve future learning). It analyzes existing agents and finds they predominantly use extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms.

Result: Many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are already present in existing agents. The paper explores optimal distribution of metacognitive responsibilities between humans and agents and discusses challenges in evaluating and improving intrinsic metacognitive learning.

Conclusion: To enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement, key challenges must be addressed including the distribution of metacognitive responsibilities and robust evaluation of intrinsic metacognitive learning.

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

### [34] [LLM-First Search: Self-Guided Exploration of the Solution Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05213)
*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-First Search (LFS), a novel method allowing Large Language Models to autonomously control the search process for problem-solving, leading to better performance on challenging tasks, greater computational efficiency, and better scalability with stronger models and increased compute budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing search methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search rely on fixed exploration hyperparameters which limit their adaptability across tasks of varying difficulty. This makes them impractical or expensive in certain settings.

Method: LLM-First Search (LFS) is proposed as a new 'LLM Self-Guided Search' method that removes the need for pre-defined search strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via self-guided exploration based on its internal scoring mechanisms.

Result: LFS performs better on more challenging tasks without additional tuning, is more computationally efficient compared to other methods especially when powered by a stronger model, scales better with stronger models due to its LLM-First design, and scales better with increased compute budget.

Conclusion: LLM-First Search provides a more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning approach for problem-solving tasks, outperforming traditional methods in terms of adaptability, efficiency, and scalability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

*Violet Xiang,Chase Blagden,Rafael Rafailov,Nathan Lile,Sang Truong,Chelsea Finn,Nick Haber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALP is a RL method that adjusts token generation based on problem difficulty, reducing token usage by 50% without performance drop.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for controlling token generation either waste computation on easy problems or require significant manual intervention. There's a need for an adaptive approach that efficiently allocates computational resources according to problem difficulty.

Method: ALP uses reinforcement learning to monitor the solve rate of each prompt during training and applies a differentiable penalty inversely proportional to the solve rate. This means easy problems are penalized more heavily for extra tokens than hard ones.

Result: Post-training with ALP reduces average token usage by 50% without significantly affecting performance. It outperforms fixed-budget and uniform penalty methods by reallocating saved tokens from easy to hard prompts, improving accuracy on difficult problems.

Conclusion: ALP demonstrates an effective way to adaptively control token generation in reasoning models, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing performance on challenging tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of 'Control tax' in AI Control (AIC) to quantify the cost of integrating safety measures into AI systems. It provides a theoretical framework, evaluates language models in adversarial settings, and offers cost-effective monitoring strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for robust oversight mechanisms as agentic AI is rapidly integrated into high-stakes real-world applications. Practical adoption of AI Control depends heavily on the implementation overhead, prompting the study of 'Control tax'.

Method: The paper introduces a theoretical framework to quantify the Control Tax, conducts comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models under adversarial conditions, and provides empirical financial cost estimates along with optimized monitoring strategies.

Result: The framework allows practitioners to connect safety guarantees with their costs, providing informed decision-making capabilities. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed monitoring strategies in balancing safety and cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: This work advances the field of AI Control by offering a principled economic feasibility assessment that can be applied across different deployment contexts.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Result: A detailed analysis of the risks and limitations of Concept-based Models, along with open problems and promising avenues of future research.

Conclusion: Concept-based Models have significant limitations that need to be addressed to improve their reliability and generalization.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OOD detectors mainly rely on statistical models, but there is a need to enhance their performance and explainability in open-world scenarios.

Method: Augment existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning using Markov logic networks (MLNs) that assign probabilities based on weighted logical constraints over human-understandable concepts. Also, introduce a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a dataset.

Result: MLNs can significantly enhance the performance of various existing OOD detectors while maintaining computational efficiency, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Markov logic networks can be effectively used to augment OOD detectors, providing both improved performance and explainability.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for predicting time-dependent concrete creep with high accuracy, showing the potential of data-driven approaches in materials science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting concrete creep treat time as just an input parameter rather than modeling its sequential nature. The authors aim to address this limitation by transforming the prediction task into an autoregressive sequence modeling problem similar to language processing.

Method: The method uses a transformer architecture with a triple-stream attention framework including temporal attention, feature attention, and batch attention. This captures long-range dependencies in historical creep patterns.

Result: The model achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999 across all datasets, outperforming traditional empirical models and existing machine learning approaches.

Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in modeling complex material behaviors and establishes the potential for transformers to revolutionize structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

TL;DR: This paper introduces SafeSteer, a method to guide LLM outputs using category-specific steering vectors and a gradient-free unsupervised approach, enhancing safety without explicit refusal or needing contrastive pairwise data. It shows effectiveness across various LLMs, datasets, and risk categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models for evolving safety policies is costly and impractical, while mechanistic interpretability has untapped potential for precise, customizable safety adjustments.

Method: SafeSteer uses category-specific steering vectors for precise control, employs a gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety steering, and doesn't require contrastive pairwise safe data.

Result: SafeSteer effectively provides precise control over LLM outputs, prevents blanket refusals, and guides models towards generating safe content while maintaining topic relevance across different LLMs, datasets, and risk categories.

Conclusion: SafeSteer offers an effective approach for guiding LLM outputs with enhanced safety, precision, and without compromising text quality or requiring complex methods.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Conclusion: MUC-G4 provides a promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural networks in practical applications.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SF2Bench, a dataset for compound flood analysis in South Florida integrating tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities. It evaluates six machine learning methods for flood forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compound flood forecasting is challenging due to the complex interplay of multiple factors and limitations of traditional physics-based methods. There is a lack of comprehensive datasets for systematic analysis.

Method: The study uses SF2Bench, a new dataset that integrates four key factors (tide, rainfall, groundwater, human management). It evaluates six categories of machine learning models including MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers, and LLMs for flood forecasting.

Result: Experiments verified the impact of different features on flood forecasting and provided insights into temporal and spatial dependencies. Each method showed varying performance in capturing complex dependencies.

Conclusion: The diverse capabilities of various modeling paradigms were demonstrated. The findings can inform the development of improved flood forecasting approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

*Runxiang Wang,Boxiao Wang,Kai Li,Yifan Zhang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DrSR is a new framework that combines data-driven insight with reflective learning to enhance the robustness and discovery capability of symbolic regression. It guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships within the data and monitors equation performance to refine subsequent generations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for symbolic regression often over-rely on internal priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during equation generation.

Method: DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g., monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations.

Result: Experiments across interdisciplinary datasets demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency.

Conclusion: DrSR enables more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space and has potential for scientific equation discovery.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) for detecting changes in multi-spectral satellite images caused by natural disasters, enabling prioritized downlinking of relevant data. The model is training-free and achieved comparable or better results than state-of-the-art AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of bandwidth-limited downlinking of satellite data by processing at least some of the data on-board and prioritising pertinent data to be downlinked.

Method: A Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) that uses physical neural networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as memristors. The weights in the network are dynamic and update according to memristor equations of state and electrical circuit conservation laws, generating physics-constrained dynamical output features for change detection.

Result: The PANN achieved comparable or better results than a state-of-the-art AI model in each natural disaster category.

Conclusion: The PANN presents a promising solution for resource-constrained on-board processing of satellite data.

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前各种适应技术虽能以最少计算资源提高性能，但有限的适应数据往往导致训练困难，因此需要一种新方法来充分利用预训练backbone模型所用的大量数据。

Method: 提出BAT方法，利用backbone数据增强适应数据集，并证明其有效性及适用条件；同时引入满足这些命题的高级数据选择方案，并提出ALBAT算法实现此方法。

Result: 在个性化和语言生成任务中，ALBAT能够有效增强适应训练，尤其是在数据稀缺的情况下。

Conclusion: BAT方法及其ALBAT算法为解决适应数据不足的问题提供了有效的解决方案，能够在数据稀缺的情况下提升适应训练的效果。

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer模型在不同学习模式下的关系推理机制被研究。发现权重内学习（IWL）自然地对传递性推理有偏好，而上下文内学习（ICL）则没有这种能力，除非预先训练线性回归任务。这表明具有底层结构的任务的预训练可以促进上下文中关系推理的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer模型在不同学习模式下进行关系推理的机制，特别是其在传递性推理任务中的表现和泛化能力。

Method: 比较两种学习模式：权重内学习（IWL）和上下文内学习（ICL），分析它们在经典心理学任务——传递性推理中的行为差异，并通过机械性分析探讨ICL模型为何无法有效进行传递性推理。此外，还研究了预训练任务对ICL模型的影响。

Result: IWL模式下模型表现出对传递性推理的自然偏好，而ICL模式下模型仅能处理相邻项目的关系，无法进行间接关系推理。但经过线性回归任务预训练后，ICL模型能够成功进行可泛化的传递性推理。

Conclusion: 预训练于具有底层结构的任务有助于发展支持上下文中关系推理的表示形式，且不同的学习模式显著影响模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Method: The authors derive an effective method for combining the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty approach with RL under common and reasonable conditions through theoretical analysis. They propose the LDPTRLQ algorithm which theoretically balances the short-term greedy optimization of Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL.

Result: Simulation results across multiple problems indicate that the proposed LDPTRLQ algorithm outperforms baseline methods using either the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty or RL alone. It also surpasses other benchmarks regarding compatibility and stability.

Conclusion: The LDPTRLQ algorithm offers a theoretically superior way to integrate Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with reinforcement learning for addressing complex optimization challenges in IoT settings, demonstrating better performance and stability.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for

using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep-learning framework for accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity in open-pit mining, which integrates real-world operational records and synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios. XGBoost regressor and LSTM network are evaluated, with SHAP value analyses identifying key predictors. Future work aims to integrate more data for enhanced forecast robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in open-pit mining due to operational uncertainties introduced by weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and variable crew availability.

Method: The method involves a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records (high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios. Two architectures are evaluated: an XGBoost regressor and a Long Short-Term Memory network.

Result: XGBoost regressor achieves a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent, while the Long Short-Term Memory network has a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. SHAP value analyses reveal cumulative rainfall, historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features reduces prediction volatility.

Conclusion: This hybrid modelling approach provides a comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management under dynamically uncertain conditions in open-pit mining.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to

metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 4-step process using softlog-softmax cascades to enhance consistency and reliability in next-gen ensemble learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation ensemble learning systems.

Method: A 4-step process: anatomical composition of ensemble model with diversity as main criterion, physiological softlog for consistent weak logarithmic operations leading to intermediate decisions, neural information theory with softlog-based entropy and divergence for constructing information measures, and derivation of an informative performance tensor for reliable ensemble evaluation.

Result: Showed that ensemble diversity is more useful for complex problems, constructed information measures yielding consistent values on closed intervals, and determined relationships between individual and sub-community decisions.

Conclusion: An informative performance tensor was derived to reliably evaluate ensemble learning systems.

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

TL;DR: AI agents using LLMs show great flexibility but bring concerns about cost and efficiency. This paper analyzes their resource usage, latency, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power demands, revealing diminishing returns and unsustainable costs with increased compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the system-level implications of AI agents' resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling strategies.

Method: Conduct a comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying various metrics such as resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power consumption demands. Evaluate how different design choices (e.g., few-shot prompting, reflection depth, parallel reasoning) impact accuracy-cost tradeoffs.

Result: Findings indicate that while agents improve accuracy with more compute, they experience rapidly diminishing returns, increased latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs.

Conclusion: There is a need for a paradigm shift in agent design to focus on compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with real-world deployability constraints.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under

Conclusion: This work aims to enhance understanding of RFT-based red teaming algorithms' implementation nuances and enable rapid prototyping of innovative features for RFT-based red teaming.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving user privacy in large language model (LLM) chatbot interactions without significantly compromising data utility.

Method: Urania employs private clustering mechanisms and innovative keyword extraction methods such as frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided approaches. It also leverages DP tools like clustering, partition selection, and histogram-based summarization to provide end-to-end privacy protection.

Result: Evaluation shows that Urania can extract meaningful conversational insights while preserving stringent user privacy, effectively balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Conclusion: Urania successfully provides a solution for generating insights about LLM chatbot interactions with strong differential privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

### [57] [You Only Train Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349)
*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a method for optimizing loss weight hyperparameters in learned models via gradient-based optimization in one training run. YOTO treats hyperparameters as regular network parameters, uses a softmax operation to ensure positivity constraints and defines a novel regularization loss for uniformity among losses. Experiments on 3D estimation and semantic segmentation show YOTO outperforms grid search on unseen test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the inefficiency of multiple training runs typically required for selecting and weighting different loss functions in machine learning models. The authors aim to optimize these loss weights in one shot using gradient-based optimization techniques.

Method: The method involves automatically optimizing loss weight hyperparameters in one training run by treating them as regular parameters of the network. A novel layer parameterized with a softmax operation is introduced to satisfy positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding degenerate gradients. Additionally, a new regularization loss is defined to model a uniformity prior among employed losses and ensure boundedness of optima.

Result: Experiments conducted on state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision - 3D estimation and semantic segmentation - demonstrate that YOTO consistently outperforms the best model obtained through brute-force grid search on unseen test data.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that YOTO provides an effective way to jointly optimize loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one shot. This approach shows promising results compared to traditional methods like grid search, potentially leading to more efficient model training processes.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为'half'的隐藏层单元，其中一些权重被随机设置而另一些则通过训练得到。实验表明，在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上使用这种'half'层可以减少参数数量并达到合理的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少深度网络中的参数数量并利用随机连接的正则化效果，提出了包含部分随机权重和部分可训练权重的隐藏层单元。

Method: 'Half'单元由两个阶段组成：首先，它对其输入进行带固定随机权重的加权和；其次，总激活值通过两个可修改的权重进行放大和平移，然后通过非线性函数。每个隐藏单元的可修改权重数量为两个，与扇入无关。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上的实验结果表明，使用'half'层可以在减少参数数量的情况下达到合理的准确率。

Conclusion: 'Half'层单元能够在保持合理准确率的同时减少模型参数量，这得益于随机连接的正则化效果。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new composite reward function for reinforcement learning in financial trading with four differentiable terms, offering a modular approach to balance return and risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single metric objectives for reinforcement learning in financial trading do not provide enough flexibility to encode diverse investor preferences.

Method: A novel composite reward function is proposed, consisting of annualized return, downside risk, differential return, and the Treynor ratio.

*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial training (AT) is an effective method for enhancing deep neural network robustness. This paper explores AT mechanisms via class-wise feature attribution, focusing on cross-class features that aid in robust classification. Studies reveal models initially learn cross-class features for optimal robustness but shift to class-specific features as robust overfitting occurs, offering a unified view of AT properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the mechanisms and dynamics of adversarial training (AT), specifically by analyzing how class-wise feature attribution influences AT.

Method: The authors investigate AT through the lens of class-wise feature attribution, identifying the role of cross-class features shared by multiple classes. They conduct systematic studies across various model architectures and settings, providing theoretical evidence from a synthetic data model.

Result: Models during AT initially prioritize learning cross-class features for optimal robustness but transition to class-specific features as robust overfitting progresses. This study unifies two existing AT properties: soft-label training benefits and robust overfitting.

Conclusion: This research refines the understanding of AT mechanisms and offers new perspectives for future studies on AT.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces, enabling a wrapper approach around Euclidean tree-based models for improved performance and maintainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend decision tree models from Euclidean to hyperbolic spaces using the Beltrami-Klein model, preserving the thresholding operation and leveraging existing optimizations in Euclidean models.

Method: Reexpress the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model, allowing it to be implemented as pre- and post-processing steps around existing Euclidean tree-based models.

Result: The wrapper approach enhances flexibility, speed, and accuracy of hyperbolic decision trees while providing a simpler and more maintainable codebase.

Conclusion: This reinterpretation and implementation offer an efficient way to utilize hyperbolic decision trees with benefits derived from established Euclidean models.

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

### [62] [Privacy Amplification Through Synthetic Data: Insights from Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05101)
*Clément Pierquin,Aurélien Bellet,Marc Tommasi,Matthieu Boussard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how synthetic data generated from linear regression models affects privacy. It finds that if an adversary controls the generative model's seed, a single synthetic data point can leak significant information. However, when data is generated from random inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points enhances privacy beyond the inherent guarantees of the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously understand the privacy amplification phenomenon when synthetic data is generated and the generative model is kept hidden.

Method: The study uses the framework of linear regression to establish theoretical results. Negative results are established by considering an adversary controlling the generative model's seed. Positive results are shown when synthetic data is generated from random inputs.

Result: Negative result: A single synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model itself if the adversary controls the seed. Positive result: Privacy is amplified when synthetic data is generated from random inputs and only a limited number of data points are released.

Conclusion: Findings in linear regression provide a foundation for deriving more general privacy bounds in the future.

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

*Yasaman Mahdaviyeh,James Lucas,Mengye Ren,Andreas S. Tolias,Richard Zemel,Toniann Pitassi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes sample replay in continual learning, revealing that forgetting can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples and harmful replay exists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning faces the challenge of forgetting when learning new tasks sequentially. Sample replay has been used to mitigate forgetting, but its theoretical understanding is limited.

Method: Theoretical analysis of sample replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting where each task is defined by a linear subspace. Examines the effects of replay samples and relationships between task subspaces.

Result: Forgetting can be non-monotonic regarding the number of replay samples. Replay can sometimes harm performance, even in worst-case or distributional settings. Empirical evidence shows harmful replay also occurs in neural networks trained with SGD.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of sample replay heavily depends on the choice of replay samples and the relationship between tasks. Further research is needed to understand and optimize replay strategies.

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

*Théo Vincent,Yogesh Tripathi,Tim Faust,Yaniv Oren,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In value-based reinforcement learning, though removing the target network can free up memory for the online network, it often leads to instability and performance decline. This paper proposes using a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as the target network while sharing other parameters with the online network, stepping out of the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. This new method, called iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), enhances sample efficiency in various settings, uses less memory, and has comparable training time to classical algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and performance decline issues when removing the target network in value-based reinforcement learning, while also leveraging the advantages of both target-based and target-free methods.

Method: Propose to use a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as the target network, sharing remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network. Leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning to learn consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel.

Result: The novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings, requires smaller memory footprint, and has comparable training time to classical target-based algorithms.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL) to scale reinforcement learning research by improving sample efficiency, reducing memory usage, and maintaining reasonable training times.

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

*Suzan Ece Ada,Emre Ugur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An unsupervised meta-testing method called UMCNP is introduced, which combines PPG and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. It reuses samples from PPG meta-RL for task inference learning, leverages CNPs to reduce online interactions in meta-testing, and infers latent dynamics models from a single test task rollout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more sample-efficient meta-reinforcement learning method that can work effectively when the reward signal is absent during meta-testing.

Method: UMCNP integrates parameterized policy gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL while keeping them separate. During meta-training, it reuses previously collected PPG samples for offline task inference learning. In meta-testing, it uses CNPs to decrease the number of online interactions and infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model from one test task rollout.

Result: The method achieves adaptation to unseen test tasks with significantly fewer samples compared to baselines on 2D-Point Agent and continuous control benchmarks such as cartpole with unknown angle sensor bias and walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Conclusion: UMCNP provides a novel approach to improve sample efficiency in meta-RL by combining PPG and task inference methods, particularly beneficial in scenarios where the reward signal is unavailable during meta-testing.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Conclusion: 本文通过分析CL与NSCL损失的关系及其几何结构，为自监督对比学习提供了更深入的理论理解，并证明了其在少样本学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization methods either fail to model gradient uncertainty or require expensive second-order calculations. There is need for an efficient method that can capture rich uncertainty structures without heavy computation.

Method: KOALA++ estimates the parameter covariance matrix through recursive updates of compact gradient covariance products, improving upon the original KOALA by capturing richer uncertainty structures without storing full covariance matrices or performing large matrix inversions.

Result: KOALA++ achieves accuracy equal to or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers across diverse tasks like image classification and language modeling, while maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

Conclusion: KOALA++ provides a novel approach to modeling structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training that matches or surpasses existing optimizers in performance while preserving computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了神经网络中的grokking现象，发现了新的第三阶段——反grokking，并通过HTSR度量α揭示了这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络训练过程中已知的grokking现象，以期发现新的阶段和更好的理解模型的泛化行为。

Method: 使用3层MLP在MNIST子集上进行训练，分别测试有无权重衰减的情况。利用开源工具WeightWatcher中的HTSR度量α来分析不同训练阶段的特性，同时与其它度量指标进行比较。

Result: 发现了训练后期出现的反grokking阶段，此时测试准确率下降但训练准确率保持不变。HTSR度量α能有效区分三个阶段，而其他度量仅能检测前两个阶段。此外，当α<2时，会出现Correlation Traps，预示着模型过度拟合。

Conclusion: HTSR度量α提供了一个通用的层收敛目标（约为2），并可作为衡量模型泛化的有效工具。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

### [70] [RETRO SYNFLOW: Discrete Flow Matching for Accurate and Diverse Single-Step Retrosynthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04439)
*Robin Yadav,Qi Yan,Guy Wolf,Avishek Joey Bose,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF), a new discrete flow-matching framework for single-step retrosynthesis in organic chemistry. RSF uses reaction center identification and employs Feynman-Kac steering to enhance diversity and feasibility of generated samples. The model achieves 60.0% top-1 accuracy, outperforming the previous SOTA by 20%. FK-steering improves top-5 round-trip accuracy by 19% over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying and predicting the series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule is a fundamental problem in organic chemistry. Existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches struggle with single-step reactant prediction due to the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space.

Method: The paper introduces RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF), which models single-step retrosynthesis planning using a discrete flow-matching framework. RSF builds a Markov bridge between the target product molecule and the reactant molecule, employing a reaction center identification step to produce intermediate structures known as synthons. To enhance diversity and feasibility, RSF uses Feynman-Kac steering with Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling at inference, guided by a reward oracle relying on a forward-synthesis model.

Result: Empirically, RSF achieves 60.0% top-1 accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA by 20%. Additionally, the use of FK-steering improves top-5 round-trip accuracy by 19% compared to prior template-free SOTA methods, while maintaining competitive top-k accuracy results.

Conclusion: RETRO SYNFLOW demonstrates significant improvements in both accuracy and the diversity/feasibility of generated samples for single-step retrosynthesis. The method sets a new benchmark in the field of organic chemistry reactant prediction.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 设计了通过增加链接函数构建的选择性匹配损失函数，以强调预测准确性在子集区域的重要性。利用复合Softmax函数开发多维选择性损失框架，克服标准Softmax函数限制，提升重要分数区域预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多应用中，准确预测某个子集或区域比其他区域更重要，而传统损失函数无法有效区分这些区域的重要性。因此需要一种新的损失函数来解决模型的不确定性，并提高在高敏感区域的预测性能。

Method: 通过设计递增的链接函数构建选择性匹配损失函数，定义损失敏感度为分数的函数，强调高斜率、高敏感度区域。对于多分类问题，使用复合Softmax函数框架开发多维选择性损失函数，增强类间排序敏感度。

Result: 选择性损失函数相比传统损失函数，在涉及重要分数区域的应用中具有显著优势，例如停留时间预测、检索、排名、知识蒸馏以及大型语言模型微调对齐等问题。

Conclusion: 选择性损失函数能够有效提高模型在重要区域的预测能力，同时通过复合Softmax函数解决了多分类问题中的排序敏感度不足的问题，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

*Huynh T. T. Tran,Jacob Sander,Achraf Cohen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI framework for NIDS. It incorporates score-based and metamodel-based methods to assess prediction reliability. Experiments show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models in classification accuracy and false omission rate. A transfer learning strategy is also developed, showing effectiveness with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper lies in enhancing the robustness, interpretability, and generalization of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by extending the existing ODXU framework.

Method: The method involves extending the ODXU framework with score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy) and metamodel-based techniques (including SHAP values and Information Gain). Additionally, a transfer learning strategy is developed which reuses the pre-trained autoencoder, retrains the clustering module, and fine-tunes the XGBoost classifier.

Result: Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset demonstrate that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six evaluation metrics. The ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 shows that the optimal transfer configuration outperforms traditional neural models even with limited training data. Metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches.

Conclusion: ODXU, as an extended Neurosymbolic AI framework, significantly enhances NIDS capabilities. The developed transfer learning strategy proves effective in cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

*Ivan Vegner,Sydelle de Souza,Valentin Forch,Martha Lewis,Leonidas A. A. Doumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper emphasizes the distinction between representation systematicity and behavioral systematicity in ML models, analyzes key benchmarks for behavioral systematicity, and highlights methods to assess representation systematicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of focus on representation systematicity in existing benchmarks and models which mainly concentrate on behavioral systematicity.

Method: Analyze key benchmarks across language and vision based on Hadley's (1994) taxonomy, and explore methods for assessing representation systematicity from the field of mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Provide insights into the current state of testing behavioral systematicity and suggest ways to evaluate representation systematicity in ML models.

Conclusion: Representation systematicity is crucial and should be more emphasized in future research efforts.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived

all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

*Jiayu Wang,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents COSMOS, a framework that predicts the performance and cost of large language models' adaptation strategies with high accuracy and minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimally selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints without requiring extensive experimentation.

Method: COSMOS is introduced as a unified prediction framework that uses embedding-augmented lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance and low-sample scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning.

Result: COSMOS achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72% on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios across eight representative benchmarks.

Conclusion: Efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes for large language models is feasible and can significantly reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

*C. Evans Hedges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a new method for training physical reservoir computing systems without backpropagation, using random perturbations to approximate gradient updates. It shows comparable performance to standard methods and potential for energy efficiency in AI training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inability to perform backpropagation in physical reservoir computing due to its black-box nature, thus enabling the integration of physical reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures.

Method: PGT uses random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient updates using only forward passes, inspired by perturbation theory in physics.

Result: PGT achieves performance comparable to standard backpropagation methods in scenarios where backpropagation is impractical or impossible, demonstrated on simulated neural networks and experimental hardware.

Conclusion: PGT is a promising approach for integrating physical reservoirs into deeper neural networks and achieving significant energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense

hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models increasingly relies on geographically distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware.

Method: Propose HALoS with local parameter servers within each region and a global parameter server that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler effects, and leverages fast intra-region links.

Result: Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: Hierarchical, server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed environments.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

*Luca Ghafourpour,Valentin Duruisseaux,Bahareh Tolooshams,Philip H. Wong,Costas A. Anastassiou,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOBLE is a neural operator framework that learns to predict distributions of neural dynamics from neuron features, offering efficient synthetic neuron generation and a 4200× speedup over numerical solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modeling approaches for human neurons are constrained by limited experimental data availability and variability. Ensembles of deterministic models are computationally expensive and deep learning methods fail to capture full biophysical complexity, nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability.

Method: The authors developed NOBLE, a neural operator framework that maps continuous frequency-modulated embeddings of interpretable neuron features to somatic voltage responses induced by current injection. It was trained on data from biophysically realistic neuron models.

Result: NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for intrinsic experimental variability, provides models consistent with experimentally observed responses via embedding space interpolation, and achieves a 4200× speedup over numerical solvers.

Conclusion: NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, enabling better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and neuroAI applications.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic

### [82] [Neural MJD: Neural Non-Stationary Merton Jump Diffusion for Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04542)
*Yuanpei Gao,Qi Yan,Yan Leng,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural MJD, a model that combines neural networks with non-stationary Merton jump diffusion for time series prediction. It uses stochastic differential equations and likelihood truncation for learning, and an improved solver for estimation. Experiments show it outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of deep learning models in handling non-stationary data and abrupt changes by explicitly modeling underlying stochastic processes.

Method: Neural MJD formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential equation simulation problem, combining time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion and compound Poisson process. Likelihood truncation is introduced for tractable learning and an Euler-Maruyama with restart solver is proposed for better estimation.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical learning methods.

Conclusion: Neural MJD provides a robust approach to time series prediction with non-stationary dynamics and abrupt changes.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

TL;DR: This paper presents mdQFL, a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm addressing training bottlenecks, large device numbers, and non-IID data distributions in QFL. It shows nearly 50% reduced communication costs and improved or equal accuracy compared to standard QFL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning (FL) faces challenges such as bottlenecks with massive datasets, numerous participating devices, and heterogeneity among clients impacting overall system performance. These issues are addressed within the context of Quantum Federated Learning (QFL).

Method: The authors propose mdQFL, a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm that is efficient and adaptable to various factors including different numbers of devices. The method explores training and update personalization and test generalization within the QFL setting.

Result: Experiments conducted using diverse non-IID data heterogeneity conditions and various datasets within the Qiskit environment demonstrated a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs while maintaining or exceeding final model accuracy and improving local model training compared to the standard QFL baseline.

Conclusion: mdQFL efficiently addresses the challenges in QFL, reducing communication costs and improving model performance. Theoretical analysis confirms the complexities of the algorithm, providing a strong foundation for future applications in FL scenarios.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardization in unsupervised learning workflows and promote reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.

Method: Propose a structured workflow including formulating scientific questions, data preparation, using modeling techniques, validation, and effective communication.

Result: Case study in astronomy shows the importance of validation and benefits of a well-designed workflow for unsupervised learning.

Conclusion: A carefully-designed workflow for unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过聚类输入数据和使用中位数聚合来改进差分隐私语言模型推理，生成高质量的合成文本，同时降低隐私成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的工作在创建推理批次时采用均匀随机采样敏感输入的方法，但这种方法会降低生成的私有文本的质量，特别是在敏感示例涉及异构主题时。

Method: 通过在选择推理批次之前对输入数据进行聚类，以及引入一种新的算法，该算法通过私下计算中位数而不是平均值来聚合下一个令牌统计信息。利用中位数在下一个令牌预测相似时具有降低的局部敏感性这一事实，提供了一个与数据相关且事后差分隐私保证。

Result: 在代表性指标（如MAUVE）和下游任务性能方面都显示出改进。该方法以显著较低的隐私成本生成高质量的合成数据。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过聚类和使用中位数聚合，提高了合成文本的质量并降低了隐私成本，优于之前的最先进方法。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: StatsMerging是一种基于权重分布统计的轻量级模型合并方法，无需真实标签或测试样本。通过奇异值分解、轻量级学习器和任务特定教师蒸馏等技术，实现对多个大型模型的有效合并，并在多项实验中表现出色，优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在受限内存预算下容纳多个大型模型是一个挑战，而现有的模型合并方法可能需要大量计算资源或数据支持。本文旨在提出一种新的轻量级模型合并方法，以解决这些问题并提高模型合并的效果。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

### [87] [Scaling Laws for Robust Comparison of Open Foundation Language-Vision Models and Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04598)
*Marianna Nezhurina,Tomer Porian,Giovanni Pucceti,Tommie Kerssies,Romain Beaumont,Mehdi Cherti,Jenia Jitsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of scaling laws for comparing foundation models and datasets, focusing on CLIP and MaMMUT. It provides evidence that MaMMUT improves more with scale and is more sample efficient than CLIP. The authors derive full scaling laws across different scales and tasks, showing consistent trends. They also demonstrate that comparisons can be made using a constant learning rate schedule to reduce compute cost. All pretrained models and data are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a systematic way of comparing and improving foundation models and datasets by utilizing scaling laws, which predict model properties and performance at larger scales.

Method: Deriving full scaling laws based on dense measurements for two language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT. Comparing these models across various downstream tasks (classification, retrieval, segmentation) and different open datasets (DataComp, DFN, Re-LAION). Demonstrating that comparisons can be performed using a constant learning rate schedule to reduce compute cost.

Result: Evidence shows that MaMMUT exhibits stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency compared to standard CLIP. Consistent trends were observed across different tasks and datasets. Accurate derivation of scaling laws allows for valid model and dataset comparison across scales.

Conclusion: Scaling laws provide a means to systematically compare and improve foundation models and datasets, avoiding misleading conclusions from single-scale measurements. The authors release all pretrained models and checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14 which achieves 80.3% zero-shot ImageNet-1k accuracy.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for

*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Energy-based models (EBMs) are hard to train, but linking them to generative adversarial networks through a minimax game can help. This paper proposes using bidirectional bounds instead of just lower bounds for more stable EBM training. They explore four different log-likelihood bounds and show that this method improves density estimation and sample generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty in training energy-based models (EBMs) by proposing a new approach that uses bidirectional bounds instead of just lower bounds, aiming for more stable training.

Method: The method involves maximizing a lower bound and minimizing an upper bound during EBM training. Four different log-likelihood bounds are investigated from various perspectives: singular values of the generator Jacobian, mutual information, a gradient penalty-like bound, and one based on diffusion processes.

Result: Using bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and leads to high-quality density estimation and sample generation. The different bounds have their own advantages and disadvantages which are compared in the study.

Conclusion: Bidirectional bounds provide a more stable framework for training EBMs compared to only using variational lower bounds, resulting in better density estimation and sample generation.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

### [90] [Composing Agents to Minimize Worst-case Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04632)
*Guruprerana Shabadi,Rajeev Alur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In this work, the authors formalize agentic workflows as agent graphs and focus on minimizing worst-case risk in choosing compositions of AI agents. They define worst-case risk via value-at-risk of loss distribution and present an efficient algorithm to find near-optimal agent compositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern agentic systems require decomposing complex tasks into subtasks and selecting specialized AI agents for their completion. When deploying these systems in real-world scenarios, it's essential not only to maximize task success but also minimize risks such as safety, fairness, and privacy issues. This necessitates analyzing low-probability (tail) behaviors of agent compositions.

Method: The authors model agentic workflows using directed acyclic graphs known as agent graphs. Edges represent AI agents while paths correspond to feasible agent compositions. They define worst-case risk as the tail quantile or value-at-risk of the loss distribution associated with agent behavior. An efficient algorithm is introduced that traverses the agent graph, approximating value-at-risk via a union bound and dynamic programming to find near-optimal agent compositions.

Result: The framework was evaluated on video game-like control benchmarks involving composing reinforcement learning-trained agents. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in approximating value-at-risk and identifying optimal agent compositions.

Conclusion: This paper presents a method for worst-case risk minimization in selecting agent compositions by defining risk through value-at-risk of loss distributions. The proposed algorithm efficiently finds near-optimal agent combinations and is proven to be asymptotically near-optimal for practical loss functions.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Conclusion: 所提出的理论模型可以有效帮助在大规模部署语言模型推理时，在给定成本约束下找到最优的速度配置方案，从而实现性能与成本之间的最佳平衡。

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between
cost per token versus serial token generation speed when deploying LLMs for
inference at scale. Our model takes into account arithmetic, memory bandwidth,
network bandwidth and latency constraints; and optimizes over different
parallelism setups and batch sizes to find the ones that optimize serial
inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

TL;DR: This paper surveys neural network reprogrammability as a unifying framework for model adaptation techniques, presenting a taxonomy across key dimensions and identifying promising research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently adapting large-scale pre-trained models to specific downstream tasks has become increasingly critical. However, existing adaptation approaches have evolved largely in isolation without a clear understanding of their interrelationships.

Method: The authors introduce neural network reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model adaptation techniques such as model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt instruction. They present a taxonomy categorizing information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key dimensions: manipulation format, location, operator, and output alignment requirement.

Result: This framework applies consistently across data modalities, independent of specific model architectures. It reveals theoretical connections and practical distinctions among established techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: Neural network reprogrammability is positioned as a fundamental paradigm for efficient model adaptation. The paper identifies promising research directions emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

TL;DR: This position paper argues against the overemphasis on oversmoothing as a barrier to deep GNNs and demonstrates that classical solutions enable successful stacking of deep GNN layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the prevailing belief that oversmoothing is a main obstacle to building deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and to explore the potential of deep GNN architectures.

Method: The method involves analyzing the three core operations of GNNs (aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation) and demonstrating that oversmoothing has been mistakenly associated with aggregation when it should be linked to transformation and activation. The paper also shows how classical solutions like skip connections and normalization can help in stacking deep GNN layers without performance degradation.

Result: The results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing and highlight the potential for deep GNNs by showing that performance does not degrade with deeper layers when using classical solutions.

Conclusion: Oversmoothing has been overstated as an issue unique to GNNs, and with appropriate techniques, deep GNN architectures can be successfully developed.

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'Curse of dimensionality' is prevalent across various data patterns, which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in Partial Multi-label Learning (PML).

Method: Our proposed method utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally, representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability to these labels.

Result: The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: This method can effectively solve the problem of high-dimensional information loss and improve the ability to identify positive labels.

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight

*Shengkun Zhu,Feiteng Nie,Jinshan Zeng,Sheng Wang,Yuan Sun,Yuan Yao,Shangfeng Chen,Quanqing Xu,Chuanhui Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In federated learning, datasets are often not i.i.d., and personalizing parts of the model can cause client drift. The paper proposes FedAPM, an FL framework based on ADMM, to mitigate client drift by constructing an augmented Lagrangian function with first-order and second-order proximal terms. Experiments show that FedAPM converges faster and more accurately than SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of client drift in federated learning caused by partial model personalization, which reduces the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms.

Method: The method involves proposing an FL framework called FedAPM based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). It constructs the augmented Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal terms into the objective, providing fixed and compensatory corrections between local and shared models.

Result: FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence, outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer communication rounds.

Conclusion: FedAPM is more stable and efficient in terms of convergence compared to other FL frameworks and demonstrates global convergence from arbitrary initial points to a stationary point under mild assumptions.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

TL;DR: 在时间序列预测中，特别是零售数据集（M5和VN1）的集成学习背景下，评估了十个基础模型和八个集成配置。研究表明，集成方法能显著提高预测性能，但计算成本较高。减少重新训练频率可大幅降低成本，且对准确性影响较小。小规模集成（2-3个模型）通常能达到接近最优的结果，为部署可扩展和成本效益高的预测系统提供了实际指导。

Motivation: 随着数据集规模和预测模型复杂性的持续增长，在时间序列预测的集成学习中，准确性和计算成本之间的权衡成为一个非常相关的话题。需要评估不同模型和集成配置的性能及成本，以支持可持续AI的发展目标。

Method: 研究评估了十个基础模型和八个集成配置在两个大规模零售数据集（M5和VN1）上的表现，考虑了不同重新训练频率下的点预测和概率预测准确性。

Result: 集成方法能显著提升预测性能，尤其是概率预测场景下。减少重新训练频率可大幅降低成本，同时对准确性影响较小。小规模集成（2-3个模型）通常能达到接近最优的结果。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计集成方法和选择适当的重新训练策略，可以在保证准确性、鲁棒性的同时，降低计算成本，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

### [97] [Towards Better Generalization via Distributional Input Projection Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04690)
*Yifan Hao,Yanxin Lu,Xinwei Shen,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In the era of overparameterized models, simply relying on training loss is insufficient to evaluate generalization performance. This paper proposes Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a new framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer, thereby inducing a smoother loss landscape and enhancing generalization. Theoretical analysis shows that DIPNet reduces local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz constant of the network. Empirical results across various architectures and tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in test performance under different conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As overparameterized models become more common, there is a need for better indicators of generalization performance beyond just training loss. Smoothness has been shown to improve generalization, but enforcing it directly in neural networks is difficult.

Method: The paper introduces DIPNet, which projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer, creating a distributional representation that induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to the input. This approach aims to promote better generalization.

Result: Empirical validation across multiple architectures and tasks, such as Vision Transformers, Large Language Models, ResNet, and MLPs, shows consistent enhancement in test performance under standard settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DIPNet provides a general and effective method to boost generalization performance in modern deep learning by seamlessly integrating its input projection strategy into existing models.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

*Jaeseung Heo,Kyeongheung Yun,Seokwon Yoon,MoonJeong Park,Jungseul Ok,Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a proximal Bregman response function for GNNs that relaxes convexity requirements and accurately predicts the influence of both edge deletions and insertions, considering message propagation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting the influence of edge modifications in GNNs rely on strict assumptions, only consider edge deletions, and neglect changes in message propagation.

Method: The authors introduce a proximal Bregman response function tailored for GNNs, which removes the need for convexity assumptions and accounts for both edge deletions and insertions along with their impact on message propagation.

Result: Experiments using real-world datasets show accurate influence predictions across different GNN characteristics. The method is also shown to be versatile in applications like graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective tool for understanding edge influence in GNNs, improving interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

*Xingwu Chen,Tianle Li,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and its impact on improving reasoning abilities in models. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, it shows RLVR optimizes the selection of high-success-rate reasoning patterns and identifies two convergence regimes based on initial model strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the empirical successes of reinforcement learning (RL), the mechanisms by which it improves reasoning abilities are not well understood. This motivates a systematic study of RLVR to understand its effects on reasoning capabilities.

Method: The study involves developing and analyzing RLVR, examining how it optimizes the selection of reasoning patterns. Theoretical analyses on convergence and training dynamics are conducted using a simplified question-reason-answer model, and gradient flow is studied to show pattern selection. Experiments validate these findings.

Result: RLVR-trained models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. Two distinct convergence regimes were identified based on initial model strength, with slower optimization for weaker models mitigated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Conclusion: This work enhances the theoretical understanding of RL's role in fine-tuning LLMs and provides insights into improving reasoning capabilities through RLVR.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Drought is a significant environmental challenge in Bangladesh. Traditional indices and current machine learning models have limitations. This study proposes a satellite data-driven machine learning framework to classify drought severity across 38 districts, using unsupervised algorithms for clustering and classification models. The approach successfully classifies drought severity but shows regional variabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drought poses an environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature, limiting their resolution. Machine learning models applied to drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh.

Method: A satellite data-driven machine learning framework is proposed to classify drought severity across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Unsupervised algorithms (K-means, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture) are used for clustering, followed by classification models (KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes). The framework integrates weather data (humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024.

Result: The approach successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions.

Conclusion: Machine learning models demonstrate aptitude in identifying and predicting drought conditions, highlighting the potential of such models for addressing drought challenges in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

*José Manuel de Frutos,Manuel A. Vázquez,Pablo M. Olmos,Joaquín Míguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces dual-ISL, a new method for training implicit generative models that provides theoretical advantages and practical benefits over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rank-based statistical metrics like ISL have proven effective for training implicit generative models. The authors seek to improve upon this by introducing a novel approach that interchanges the roles of target and model distributions in the ISL framework.

Method: The method involves creating a convex optimization problem by switching the roles of target and model distributions in the ISL framework, leading to a rank-based discrepancy $d_K$. This discrepancy is continuous and convex, unlike classical divergences. The authors also provide a theoretical framework interpreting $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection onto a Bernstein polynomial basis and extend their analysis to multivariate settings via random one-dimensional projections.

Result: The dual-ISL method empirically converges more rapidly, offers smoother and more stable training, and effectively prevents mode collapse compared to classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods. It also provides an explicit density approximation.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL presents a theoretically sound and practically advantageous approach for training implicit generative models, outperforming existing methods in various benchmarks.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Motivation: 随着生成模型的日益强大和普及，由于隐私问题、法律要求或纠正有害内容等原因，对特定数据进行‘遗忘’的能力变得越来越重要。

Method: 提出了基于损失梯度正交化的快速遗忘算法，通过选择性地移除特定数据点的影响来实现有效的遗忘，而无需从头开始重新训练模型。

Result: 该算法在MNIST和CelebA数据集上的实验结果表明，其遗忘时间比前人方法（如梯度手术）快几个数量级，并且能够保持模型的原始保真度。

Conclusion: 所提出的快速遗忘算法能够有效实现数据遗忘，同时保持生成质量和所需训练步数较少，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents MGRPO, an enhancement of GRPO algorithm that adds a second layer for error correction to improve reasoning and training stability in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of inefficient exploration dynamics in GRPO due to lack of intermediate supervision which can lead to reward vanishing and unstable training.

Method: MGRPO operates in two layers - first layer uses standard GRPO to generate initial response and second layer is trained to identify and correct errors in this response creating a self-correction loop.

Result: Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show MGRPO significantly outperforms standard GRPO.

Conclusion: MGRPO improves both reasoning and self-correction abilities of large language models.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers的注意力机制对于精确和可扩展的序列建模是一个重要的基本组件，但其计算和内存复杂度仍然是显著的瓶颈。本文提出了一种新的注意力机制——log-linear attention，它在linear attention的效率和softmax attention的表现力之间取得了平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer中的注意力机制虽然强大，但在处理长序列时存在计算量大、内存消耗高等问题。现有的线性注意力和状态空间模型虽然能缓解这些问题，但本质上仍是RNN，存在隐藏状态固定大小的局限性。

Method: log-linear attention通过用对数增长的隐藏状态集替代固定大小的隐藏状态，从而在效率和表现力之间取得平衡。该方法允许类似矩阵乘法丰富的并行形式，计算成本与序列长度呈对数线性关系，并且可以应用于现有的线性注意力变体之上。

Result: 通过对两种近期架构（Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet）实例化log-linear变体，发现它们相较于线性时间变体表现出良好的性能。

Conclusion: log-linear attention提供了一个通用框架，可以在不牺牲太多效率的情况下提高模型的表现力，为未来更高效的序列建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Motivation: To address the gap in understanding when and why Graph Transformers excel, and to identify effective design choices under different conditions.

Method: Introduction of OpenGT, a comprehensive benchmark for Graph Transformers that establishes standardized experimental settings and incorporates a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs for evaluation from multiple perspectives.

Result: The benchmark uncovered critical insights including the difficulty of transferring models across task levels, limitations of local attention, efficiency trade-offs, application scenarios of specific positional encodings, and preprocessing overhead of some positional encodings.

Conclusion: This work aims to establish a foundation for future graph transformer research with emphasis on fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

TL;DR: 研究了具有重尾奖励的随机线性bandits问题，提出了新的基于消除的算法和改进的上下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望改进具有有限(1+ε)-绝对中心矩奖励的随机线性bandits问题中的minimax regret的上下界。现有的构造方法在某些情况下不能达到最优速率，因此需要提出新的算法和分析方法。

Method: 提出了一种由实验设计引导的新消除算法，该算法实现了改进的regret上界，并且对于所有ε ∈ (0,1)改善了对d的依赖关系。同时，还建立了新的下界，严格改进了多臂bandit的速率，突出了重尾线性bandit问题的难度。对于有限动作集，也推导了类似的改进上下界。最后，提供了与动作集相关的regret上界，表明对于某些几何形状可以进一步减少对d的依赖，并通过核技巧处理无限维设置。

Result: 新算法实现了regret上界的改进，特别是对于ε = 1时恢复了已知的最优结果。同时，新下界严格改进了多臂bandit的速率，强调了问题的困难程度。对于特定几何形状（如lp-范数球），可以进一步减少对d的依赖，并首次为Matérn核建立了次线性的regret界限。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法和分析方法显著改进了重尾奖励随机线性bandits问题的regret上下界，展示了问题的复杂性和可能的优化方向。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

TL;DR: This paper explores the connection between k-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in vector quantization through Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). It shows that KDE-QUBO is a special case of k-medoids-QUBO under certain assumptions, revealing a deeper relationship between the two approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the connection between two prominent vector quantization methods: k-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), by formulating them within the framework of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO).

Method: Compare a heuristic QUBO formulation for k-medoids with a principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based VQ. Analyze the conditions under which KDE-QUBO becomes a special case of k-medoids-QUBO.

Result: Demonstrated that KDE-QUBO is a special case of k-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map, providing new insights into the geometric interpretation of weighting parameters in QUBO formulations for vector quantization.

Conclusion: There exists a deeper structural relationship between k-medoids and KDE methods in vector quantization when viewed through the lens of QUBO, offering new perspectives on their underlying mechanisms.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting

TL;DR: Adam优化器在训练不同架构和规模的神经网络时，常出现损失峰值。本文研究发现Adam的自适应预调节器本身可触发这些峰值，当梯度平方远小于二阶矩估计时，会导致最大特征值超出经典稳定性阈值，引发不稳定性和损失峰值。此机制通过大量实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究使用Adam优化器时神经网络训练中常见的损失峰值现象的根本原因，超越以往将该现象归因于损失景观更尖锐特性的解释。

Method: 分析Adam的自适应预调节器如何触发损失峰值，特别是在梯度平方远小于二阶矩估计的关键区域内，导致二阶矩估计缓慢响应当前梯度信息，并使预调节Hessian的最大特征值超出经典稳定性阈值。

Result: 通过在全连接网络、卷积网络和Transformer架构上的广泛实验，验证了Adam自适应预调节器引发损失峰值的机制。

Conclusion: Adam优化器的自适应预调节器可以独立引发训练过程中的损失峰值，这种现象与梯度和二阶矩估计的关系有关，并可能影响模型训练的稳定性。

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 通过强化学习在逻辑谜题上微调大型语言模型，可以提高其结构化推理能力，尤其是多步骤问题的解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在监督任务中表现出色，但在不熟悉的环境中进行结构化推理时却常常遇到困难。这表明标准的微调方法可能只植入了狭窄的、特定领域的启发式规则，而非通用的思考策略。

Method: 提出了一种“玩中学”框架，通过强化学习在七个定制逻辑谜题上对大型语言模型进行微调。这些谜题旨在培养不同的推理技能，如约束传播、空间一致性和符号演绎。模型根据谜题正确性接收二进制反馈，鼓励迭代和假设驱动的问题解决。

Result: 这种训练方法显著提高了模型在数学基准测试中的分布外性能，特别是在需要多步推理的中等难度问题上。分析显示，谜题训练促进了可转移的推理例程，增强了代数操作、几何推理和组合逻辑能力，但对于死记硬背或高度专业化的任务帮助有限。

Conclusion: 强化学习在逻辑谜题上的应用重塑了大型语言模型的内部推理机制，使其能够实现更强大和更具组合性的泛化，而无需依赖特定任务的符号工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Motivation: 现有的医疗保健系统在管理和解释大量异构患者数据以实现个性化护理方面面临重大挑战，且当前方法常关注狭窄的用例和有限特征空间，忽略了患者健康所需的复杂纵向互动。

Method: 提出了一种新的患者路径建模方法——EHR2Path，该方法将多样化电子健康记录（EHR）数据转化为结构化表示，并设计了一个全面的路径预测模型，同时引入一种新的摘要机制，将长期时间上下文嵌入主题特定的摘要标记中，从而提高性能并更高效利用标记。

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

### [111] [Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859)
*Yin Lu,Tong He,Xuening Zhu,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses weaknesses in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and analogous Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), proposing a hybrid model that overcomes these limitations. Theoretical proofs and empirical evaluations demonstrate the hybrid model's efficacy in recovering structured data, estimating manifold dimensions, and producing sparser latent representations without increasing reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite their wide applicability, there have been few changes to SAEs beyond the original recipe from decades ago. This work aims to address underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs and VAEs when applied to similar tasks.

Method: The authors propose a hybrid alternative model that combines elements of SAEs and VAEs. The model is designed to recover certain forms of structured data spread across a union of manifolds. It produces sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction error.

Result: Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed model accurately estimates underlying manifold dimensions and produces sparser latent representations. It exceeds the performance of equivalent-capacity SAEs, VAEs, and recent diffusion models where applicable.

Conclusion: The hybrid model offers a significant improvement over traditional SAEs and VAEs in modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data, particularly for images and language model activation patterns.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Sameer Khurana,Ricard Marxer,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why contrastive losses are ineffective for learning aligned representation spaces due to modality-specific information, theoretically explains it via the Information Bottleneck Principle, empirically studies hyperparameters' effects, and proposes a regularization term in the loss function to enhance representational alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive losses have been found to be ineffective for learning an aligned representation space because they do not address modality-specific information.

Method: The authors use the Information Bottleneck Principle to theoretically explain the problem. They introduce a regularization term derived from variational approximation to increase representational alignment and study the impact of different hyperparameters through controlled experiments.

Result: The proposed regularization term improves representational alignment as demonstrated in controlled experiments and real-world applications.

Conclusion: Modality-specific information affects the effectiveness of contrastive losses. A regularization term can help improve the alignment of multimodal representations.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

### [113] [There Was Never a Bottleneck in Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04877)
*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) that improve upon Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) by incorporating an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective, ensuring each representation component retains only information relevant to its corresponding concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. CBMs have been introduced to address this issue but they do not impose a true bottleneck as the components may encode more information than just the corresponding concept.

Method: The authors propose MCBMs which incorporate an IB objective to constrain each representation component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept via a variational regularization term added to the training loss.

Result: MCBMs support concept-level interventions with theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer greater flexibility in key design choices.

Conclusion: MCBMs provide a solution to the interpretability and intervention concerns of CBMs by enforcing a stricter bottleneck through the IB objective.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

TL;DR: The paper presents a semi-automated method for classifying hip dysplasia using CT scans, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional angle-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more accurate and efficient method for early diagnosis of hip dysplasia to reduce the risk of osteoarthritis.

Method: Development of the Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM) using volumetric CT scans and clinically annotated landmarks. The model combines Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism.

Result: GPDSSM effectively distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls, highlighting regions with dysplastic variations. It improves classification accuracy (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%) and saves clinical time by automating measurements.

Conclusion: GPDSSM offers an advanced approach for hip dysplasia classification, providing both improved accuracy and efficiency in diagnosis.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: To simplify human-machine interaction and align automation systems with the principles of Industry 5.0 by leveraging the capabilities of Agentic AI systems.

Method: Proposes a conceptual framework integrating Agentic AI with intent-based paradigm. Human operators express goals in natural language which are decomposed into actionable components guiding sub-agents to execute tasks.

Result: Proof of concept using CMAPSS dataset and Google ADK demonstrates feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach has potential to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable, intent-driven automation despite concerns over data quality and explainability.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large

enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction

the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous

TL;DR: FPTQuant introduces four function-preserving transforms to facilitate quantization of transformers, achieving minimal overhead and SOTA speed-up.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models require substantial compute and energy at inference time. Naive quantization can significantly degrade performance due to large magnitude outliers.

Method: FPTQuant introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving transforms (FPTs) which are designed to maintain the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to be more quantization friendly.

Result: FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP. Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off.

Conclusion: FPTQuant is performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cautious Optimism, a framework for accelerating no-regret learning in general games by pacing Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms. It achieves near-optimal regret bounds in diverse self-play and preserves optimal regret in adversarial settings without requiring monotonic step-sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show that adaptive pacing for no-regret learning is not an isolated phenomenon and to introduce a more general framework for faster regularized learning in games.

Method: Introduce the Cautious Optimism framework which takes any instance of FTRL as input and outputs an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by adaptively pacing the underlying FTRL with minimal computational overhead while retaining uncoupledness.

Result: Cautious Optimistic FTRL achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play and maintains the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: Cautious Optimism provides a novel route for fast learning in general games without relying on monotonic step-sizes, marking a significant advancement over previous methods.

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CREAM, a new type of Concept Bottleneck Models that encode concept-concept and concept-task relationships, use a regularized side-channel for competitive task performance, and maintain high concept importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model that explicitly encodes concept-concept and concept-task relationships to enforce desired reasoning, while using a side-channel to achieve competitive task performance without losing concept importance.

Method: CREAM embeds directed concept-concept and concept to task relationships specified by human experts, severs undesired information flows, and integrates a regularized black-box side-channel used only when necessary to enhance performance.

Result: Experiments show that CREAM mainly relies on concepts to achieve task performance comparable to black-box models, and the embedded relationships ease model interventions and mitigate concept leakage.

Conclusion: CREAM successfully enforces desired model reasoning through encoded relationships and maintains high concept importance with the help of a regularized side-channel.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding, a method for transforming vector-mode geospatial data into a form suitable for machine learning models. MPP uses scaled distances from shapes to reference points and outperforms rasterization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective way of encoding vector-mode geospatial data (points, lines, polygons) so that it can be used with traditional machine learning and artificial intelligence models.

Method: MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding method which is based on scaled distances from a shape to a set of reference points within a region of interest.

Result: MPP encoding possesses the desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and captures pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. It performs better than an alternative method based on rasterization.

Conclusion: MPP encoding provides an efficient and effective method for encoding vector-mode geospatial data for use in machine learning models.

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

### [122] [Tuning the Right Foundation Models is What you Need for Partial Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05027)
*Kuang He,Wei Tang,Tong Wei,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of foundation models in partial label learning (PLL) through comprehensive evaluations and proposes PartialCLIP, revealing key insights about PLL approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing PLL methods which progressively refine labels but pay less attention to foundation models that provide transferrable representations.

Method: Empirically evaluate 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8 datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. Propose PartialCLIP, an efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL, incorporating text-embedding classifier initialization and zero-shot CLIP for candidate label filtering.

Result: Foundation models significantly boost PLL performance, PLL approaches perform similarly, maintain stable performance across ambiguity levels, but are sensitive to model selection and adaptation strategies. Text-embedding classifier initialization and zero-shot CLIP filtering are effective.

Conclusion: Current PLL approaches have limitations and the study provides insights for developing more generalizable PLL models.

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

### [123] [TIMING: Temporality-Aware Integrated Gradients for Time Series Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05035)
*Hyeongwon Jang,Changhun Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for time series, current methods focus on point-wise attribution magnitudes but ignore directional impacts. This paper proposes new evaluation metrics and a method called TIMING to improve the identification of significant points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods for time series primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes while neglecting directional impact, leading to suboptimal identification of significant points.

Method: The authors propose two novel evaluation metrics - Cumulative Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP). They also introduce TIMING, an enhanced version of Integrated Gradients that incorporates temporal awareness for time series data.

Result: Conventional Integrated Gradients outperform recent counterparts under the proposed metrics. TIMING further improves performance by considering temporal relationships in time series data.

Conclusion: TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines in extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

*Nicolas Lell,Ansgar Scherp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes inductive node2vec (iN2V) to extend the application of node2vec (N2V) embeddings to unseen nodes, through modifications in training and a post-hoc procedure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shallow node embeddings such as N2V are effective for structure-based information but are limited to transductive settings, unable to handle new or unseen nodes during training.

Method: The authors introduce iN2V which includes changes to the original N2V training process and a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for unseen nodes.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that iN2V improves node classification accuracy by 1 point on average, with up to 6 points improvement depending on dataset characteristics and number of unseen nodes.

Conclusion: iN2V is an effective method to bring transductive embeddings into an inductive setting. It can be used independently or combined with other embedding methods to enrich node representations.

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

*Viet Nguyen Changjian Shui,Vijay Giri,Siddarth Arya,Amol Verma,Fahad Razak,Rahul G. Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: D3M is a monitoring algorithm that efficiently detects model performance deterioration without access to labels, providing low false positive rates and high true positive rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models operating in dynamic environments require retraining as data distribution changes over time. However, determining when to retrain, especially without access to labels, is challenging because not all shifts degrade model performance.

Method: The paper proposes D3M, an algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models, to monitor post-deployment deterioration (PDD). It provides sample complexity bounds for detecting deteriorating shifts while maintaining low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts.

Result: Empirical results on benchmark datasets and a real-world large-scale internal medicine dataset show the effectiveness of D3M in detecting model performance deterioration, making it a viable alert mechanism for critical machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: D3M offers a practical solution for monitoring model performance in dynamic environments without requiring labels, with proven efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

### [126] [NIMO: a Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05059)
*Shijian Xu,Marcello Massimo Negri,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks are hard to interpret, linear models less so. The paper introduces NIMO, a model where a neural network learns nonlinear corrections to linear model predictions while preserving the interpretability of the linear coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks have been very successful but difficult to interpret, whereas linear models are more interpretable but less expressive. This leads to the motivation for combining the benefits of both approaches.

Method: The key idea is to define a model (NIMO) where the NN learns nonlinear corrections to the linear model predictions, maintaining the interpretability of the linear coefficients. An optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood is developed to optimize NN parameters while updating linear coefficients analytically. Adaptive ridge regression is used to incorporate sparsity constraints.

Result: Empirically, it is shown that the underlying linear coefficients can be recovered while significantly improving predictive accuracy. The model outperforms other hybrid interpretable approaches in terms of maintaining the same interpretability of linear coefficients and achieves higher performance in various regression and classification settings.

Conclusion: NIMO combines the expressiveness of neural networks with the interpretability of linear models, offering a unique approach that preserves the interpretability of linear coefficients while enhancing predictive performance.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

*Marten Lienen,Abdullah Saydemir,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends HiPPO theory to include measurement noise, deriving an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics which improves resistance to noise during training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free, but in practice this assumption is often violated.

Method: The authors extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and reformulate it as a linear stochastic control problem where data are noisy outputs of a latent system. They derive an alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent system from the data without increasing runtime.

Result: Experiments show that the new initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at training and inference time.

Conclusion: The uncertainty-aware initialization enhances the robustness of state space models against noise.

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

*Tobias Pielok,Bernd Bischl,David Rügamer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A kernelized KL divergence estimator with nonparametric smoothing and importance sampling correction is proposed to stabilize training and reduce bias in semi-implicit variational inference, showing theoretical connections and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and bias in high-dimensional settings in semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI).

Method: The authors propose a kernelized KL divergence estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing and introduce an importance sampling correction to further reduce the bias. They also provide a theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational gradient descent.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms or matches state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides more stable and efficient optimization for semi-implicit variational inference.

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

*Joshua Hess,Quaid Morris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the connections between generative diffusion models and continuous-state associative memory models, emphasizing Morse-Smale dynamical systems as universal approximators. It characterizes the transition from generation to memory as noise levels decrease and discusses stability in these systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between generative diffusion models and associative memory models by studying their common underlying dynamics and transitions.

Method: Using Morse-Smale dynamical systems as a framework, the paper analyzes how these systems approximate gradient-based associative memory and diffusion models. It examines the impact of noise on these systems and evaluates structural stability.

Result: The study reveals that as noise diminishes, there is a generic transition from generative models to associative memory. Structural stability ensures system stability at vanishing noise levels, with bifurcations marking qualitative transitions.

Conclusion: Morse-Smale dynamical systems provide a robust theoretical basis for understanding the stability and transitions in both associative memory and diffusion models, offering insights into classic and modern Hopfield networks.

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces TreeRPO, a novel method that uses tree sampling to estimate mathematical expectations of rewards at various reasoning steps for LLMs. It produces fine-grained and dense reward signals, enhancing learning process and performance. Experiments show significant improvements in Qwen-2.5-Math's Pass@1 accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for optimizing LLMs through RLVR have limitations as rewards defined at the full trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for intermediate reasoning steps.

Method: TreeRPO estimates mathematical expectations of rewards using tree sampling without relying on a separate step reward model. It computes rewards based on step-level groups generated during tree sampling, building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of GRPO.

Result: TreeRPO improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math from 19.0% to 35.5%, outperforms GRPO by 2.9% in performance, and reduces average response length by 18.1%.

Conclusion: TreeRPO provides an effective and efficient way to enhance the learning process and overall performance of LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework for improving instance retrieval via a novel diffusion-based re-ranking method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based re-ranking methods face challenges in preserving positive signals over several steps, leading to reduced discriminative power beyond local regions.

Method: The LPMT framework integrates diffusion processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion (BCD), encodes instances into distributions via Locality State Embedding (LSE) for local consistency, and connects these distributions through the Thermodynamic Markovian Transition (TMT) process for global retrieval.

Result: Experimental results across diverse tasks confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

Conclusion: The LPMT framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods by enhancing both local consistency and global retrieval effectiveness.

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

TL;DR: Modern large language models' in-context learning is analyzed through a universal approximation theory, showing how transformers can perform tasks with few examples without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the mechanism behind transformers enabling in-context learning without any fine-tuning or parameter updates.

Method: Developing a universal approximation theory and demonstrating the construction of a transformer that can perform reliable predictions given only a few in-context examples for any class of functions.

Result: The constructed transformer can perform tasks reliably with few examples, offering approximation guarantees not constrained by optimization algorithm effectiveness and extending beyond convex problems and linear function classes.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into how transformers can learn general-purpose representations and adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the degree bias issue in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for node classification tasks. The proposed solution, Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss, enhances learning by adding more positive pairs using node labels and adaptively weighting these pairs based on their learning difficulty. An experimental framework named SHARP is also developed to extend HAR's applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks often suffer from degree bias in node classification tasks, leading to varied prediction performance across nodes with different degrees.

Method: The paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss which leverages node labels to add more positive pairs and adaptively weights both positive and negative pairs according to their learning hardness. Additionally, an experimental framework called SHARP is developed to broaden HAR's application range.

Result: Both theoretical analysis and experiments confirm the effectiveness of SHARP. Experimental results from four datasets indicate that SHARP performs better than baselines at both global and degree levels.

Conclusion: SHARP, utilizing HAR contrastive loss, successfully mitigates degree bias in GNNs and improves overall performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布式鲁棒核学习方案都是基于分而治之的方法，缺乏一个统一的去中心化学习框架来处理鲁棒回归问题。

Method: 在RKHS框架内，提出一种新的去中心化鲁棒核学习算法，使用由窗口函数和鲁棒性缩放参数定义的鲁棒损失函数，结合网络系统图表示，推导出高置信度收敛界并提供严格的样本选择规则。

Conclusion: 提出的去中心化鲁棒算法为鲁棒回归提供了一个统一的框架，其理论分析和收敛性结果表明了算法的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a unified framework for KernelSHAP and related estimators, providing the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and demonstrating its effectiveness through benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the usefulness of Shapley values in explaining machine learning models, calculating them exactly is computationally expensive. Randomized estimators like KernelSHAP have been developed, but lacked strong theoretical guarantees.

Method: The authors create a broad framework that includes KernelSHAP and similar estimators using various sampling strategies. They prove non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees applicable to all estimators within this framework.

Result: Benchmark tests on datasets for Decision-Tree models showed low mean squared error with reasonable sample sizes. The method also scales well to high-dimensional data like MNIST and CIFAR10, outperforming the original KernelSHAP library.

Conclusion: The study provides the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and offers a more scalable solution for estimating Shapley values.

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

TL;DR: Transformer模型在长上下文推理中面临挑战，RMT通过降低计算成本提供了解决方案，但其内存更新机制导致性能瓶颈。本文提出Diagonal Batching调度方案，在保留精确递归的同时解锁RMT中的并行性，消除顺序约束，提高GPU推理效率，且无需重新训练模型。应用于LLaMA-1B ARMT模型时，相比标准全注意力LLaMA-1B提速3.3倍，相比顺序RMT实现提速1.8倍，显著减少推理成本和延迟。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在长上下文推理中存在时间和内存复杂度高的问题，而现有的RMT解决方案虽然降低了计算成本，但其内存更新机制导致顺序执行，形成性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种名为Diagonal Batching的调度方案，该方法通过在RMT中实现跨段并行化来消除顺序约束，同时保留精确递归特性。此技术仅涉及运行时计算重新排序，因此现有RMT模型可直接采用而无需重新训练。

Result: 在LLaMA-1B ARMT模型上的实验表明，Diagonal Batching相比标准全注意力LLaMA-1B提速3.3倍，相比顺序RMT实现提速1.8倍，有效减少了推理成本和延迟。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching通过去除顺序瓶颈，显著降低了RMT的推理成本和延迟，增强了RMT在实际长上下文应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

*Severi Rissanen,RuiKang OuYang,Jiajun He,Wenlin Chen,Markus Heinonen,Arno Solin,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PTSD, a method that combines Parallel Tempering and diffusion models to enhance the efficiency of neural samplers while generating uncorrelated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural samplers are less efficient than MCMC's Parallel Tempering in target evaluations, yet PT provides dependent samples and is computationally expensive when new samples are needed.

Method: Propose PTSD which trains diffusion models progressively across temperatures using PT advantages. It also combines high-temperature diffusion models to create lower-temperature samples refined by MCMC for training the next model.

Result: PTSD allows efficient reuse of sample information across temperature levels and generates well-mixed, uncorrelated samples, improving target evaluation efficiency beyond existing diffusion-based neural samplers.

Conclusion: PTSD addresses weaknesses in both neural samplers and PT, offering a more efficient approach for sampling from unnormalized densities.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

TL;DR: 提出了一个稳定且可并行化的Mesa层版本，通过优化测试时训练，在语言建模中达到更低的困惑度和更高的下游任务性能，但增加了推理时计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前序列建模主要依赖于使用softmax自注意力机制的因果变换器架构，然而这些模型在推理过程中需要线性扩展内存和计算资源。为了解决这一问题，近期的研究提出了一系列线性化softmax操作的方法，从而开发出如DeltaNet、Mamba或xLSTM等具有恒定内存和计算成本的循环神经网络（RNN）模型。

Method: 引入了一个数值上稳定的、可分块并行化的Mesa层版本，该层源自于上下文中的损失函数，并通过快速共轭梯度求解器在每个时间点进行优化。这种方法允许在网络本身内解决顺序优化问题。

Result: 通过广泛的实验表明，最优的测试时训练能够实现比以前的RNN更低的语言建模困惑度和更高的下游基准性能，尤其是在需要长上下文理解的任务中。

Conclusion: 这项研究结果与最近通过增加测试时计算来提高性能的趋势密切相关，即通过花费计算资源来解决神经网络内部的顺序优化问题。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

TL;DR: 通过在MNIST数据集上评估稀疏自编码器（SAEs），发现当前浅层架构依赖准正交假设，限制了提取相关特征的能力。本文提出多迭代的Matching Pursuit SAEs（MP-SAE），能够在保证重建质量单调提升的同时提取分层场景中的相关特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管稀疏自编码器（SAEs）是解释神经网络表示的重要工具，但其在提取相关特征方面的能力可能受到当前浅层架构中隐含的准正交假设的限制。

Method: 在MNIST数据集上评估现有的SAEs，并引入一种新的多迭代SAE——通过展开Matching Pursuit（MP-SAE），利用残差引导的方法来提取分层场景中的相关特征，同时确保随着选择更多原子，重建质量单调提升。

Result: 所提出的MP-SAE方法能够有效克服准正交假设的限制，成功提取相关特征并提升重建性能。

Conclusion: MP-SAE为提取复杂、相关特征提供了一种有效途径，适用于如手写数字生成等分层场景，同时改进了传统SAEs的局限性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

*Yizhuo Li,Yuying Ge,Yixiao Ge,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to arbitrary target distributions by using flow-based generative models as priors, eliminating computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoiding ODE solving during optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method that can align learnable latent spaces to arbitrary target distributions more efficiently without the need for computationally expensive likelihood evaluations or ODE solving.

Method: The method involves pretraining a flow model on target features to capture the underlying distribution, then regularizing the latent space via an alignment loss which reformulates the flow matching objective. This treats the latents as optimization targets and minimizes the alignment loss to establish a computationally tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution.

Result: The authors demonstrate through a controlled setting and large-scale image generation experiments on ImageNet that their approach is effective in aligning latent spaces to target distributions, with the alignment loss landscape closely approximating the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a new way for latent space alignment validated both theoretically and empirically.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

*Zhen Qin,Jinxin Zhou,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the convergence behavior of single-layer and multi-layer Transformers, demonstrating linear convergence rates under appropriate initialization. Residual connections improve optimization stability by addressing ill-conditioning in the attention layer's output matrix.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the training dynamics of Transformers better, especially the interdependencies between components like self-attention mechanisms, feedforward networks, and residual connections.

Method: Analyze the convergence behavior of a structurally complete single-layer Transformer and extend the findings to multi-layer architectures. Examine how residual connections affect the optimization process.

Result: Gradient descent shows a linear convergence rate determined by the singular values of the output matrix from the attention layer. Residual connections alleviate ill-conditioning caused by the softmax operation, enhancing optimization stability.

Conclusion: Theoretical analysis and empirical results confirm that residual connections play a crucial role in promoting convergence stability in Transformers.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores learnability with improvements in strategic classification, providing characterizations for proper and improper learning under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning plays a crucial role in societal decision-making, necessitating consideration of how classified agents react to algorithms. While much focus has been on reducing deceptive behaviors, this paper aims to explore learnability when agents genuinely improve to achieve desirable classifications.

Method: The authors introduce an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and use it to characterize proper learning with improvements in the realizable setting. They also study improper learning under a mild generative assumption on data distribution and provide positive results for Euclidean ball improvement sets. Additionally, they examine learning in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in online learning.

Result: The paper provides exact characterizations of proper learning with improvements and gives positive results for improper learning under natural Euclidean ball improvement sets. It achieves lower generalization error and obtains mistake bounds in both realizable and agnostic online learning settings.

Conclusion: This work resolves open questions posed by previous research for both proper and improper learning, advancing the understanding of learnability with improvements in strategic classification.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

*Guillaume Pourcel,Maxence Ernoult*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm for training Hamiltonian State Space Models (HSSMs) with linear and nonlinear dynamics on time-series tasks. RHEL computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories, requiring only three forward passes irrespective of model size. It matches the performance of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) across all models and tasks, while being more energy-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) can embody physics-grounded compute paradigms, calling for learning algorithms that obey core physical principles. There is a need for efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design.

Method: RHEL is introduced in continuous time and demonstrated to be formally equivalent to the continuous adjoint state method. A discrete-time version of RHEL is proposed which is equivalent to BPTT when applied to Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). The scalability of RHEL is demonstrated by generalizing these results to hierarchies of HRUs, called Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs).

Result: RHEL consistently matches the performance of BPTT across all models and tasks, including time-series tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with sequence length reaching ~50k.

Conclusion: This work opens new doors for the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Conclusion: 通过对EF和EF^21的紧致分析，研究为误差反馈方法提供了明确的理论支持，并促进了对这些方法及其与压缩梯度下降比较的更好理解。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Motivation: Current methods struggle to provide both point-level constraints and segment-level controls in time series editing while maintaining temporal coherence.

Method: CocktailEdit framework uses two key mechanisms - confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and classifier-based control for managing statistical properties over segments.

Result: Experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate the effectiveness of CocktailEdit in achieving precise local control during denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal coherence.

Conclusion: CocktailEdit bridges the gap between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs, providing a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

Motivation: 在人工智能领域，训练数据的价值与版权保护至关重要，平台需要公平地评估并奖励数据提供者的贡献。然而，现有的基于Shapley值的方法虽然理论上更优，但计算复杂度随数据提供者数量呈指数增长，且需要为每个测试样本重新训练，导致成本过高。

Method: 提出Fast-DataShapley方法，通过一次性训练利用加权最小二乘法的Shapley值特征训练可重复使用的解释模型，避免为新测试样本重新训练。此外，还提出了三种具有理论保障的方法，从效用函数的近似计算和训练数据的组计算两方面减少训练开销。

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley方法及其配套的三种优化策略能够显著提高Shapley值计算的效率，降低计算开销，为数据贡献评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: Reservoir computing (RC) can generalize to unexplored regions without explicit structural priors by using a multiple-trajectory training scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning techniques usually cannot generalize well to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data without explicit structural priors.

Method: The authors use reservoir computing with a multiple-trajectory training scheme that supports training across a collection of disjoint time series.

Result: Reservoir computers trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Conclusion: This study shows that reservoir computing can generalize effectively to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAILOR, a method that surpasses traditional BC by learning to search from expert demonstrations and effectively recovering from mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral cloning (BC) has limitations in teaching agents recovery strategies when they encounter unseen states due to its reliance on expert-visited states for dense supervision.

Method: SAILOR learns to search from expert demonstrations incorporating a world model and a reward model, enabling planning to match expert outcomes even after errors. It focuses on stable and efficient learning of recovery behavior without extra human corrections.

Result: SAILOR outperforms state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC across various visual manipulation tasks. Increasing BC demonstration data 5-10 times still results in a performance gap.

Conclusion: SAILOR successfully identifies subtle failures, is robust to reward hacking, and provides an effective solution beyond the capabilities of standard BC methods.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

TL;DR: The paper explores the sample efficiency of test-time strategies for large language models, theoretically compares self-consistency and best-of-$n$, presents an expressiveness result for self-correction, and empirically validates these findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the theoretical underpinnings of different test-time strategies used to enhance large language models' performance on complex tasks.

Method: The authors first conduct a theoretical analysis comparing the sample efficiency of self-consistency and best-of-$n$ methods. They then present a theoretical result on the expressiveness of self-correction with verifier feedback. Lastly, they empirically validate their theoretical findings.

Result: Self-consistency requires more samples ($\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$) compared to best-of-$n$ ($\Theta(1/\Delta)$). Self-correction with verifier feedback allows Transformers to simulate online learning over multiple experts, enabling them to solve multiple tasks without task-specific knowledge.

Conclusion: The study provides a deeper theoretical understanding of test-time strategies and demonstrates the practical effectiveness of self-correction methods in enhancing LLMs' capabilities.

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

### [151] [Power Law Guided Dynamic Sifting for Efficient Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05300)
*Nirav Koley,Prajwal Singhania,Abhinav Bhatele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SiftAttention is a novel method that reduces memory bandwidth usage during attention computations in large language models by using a computationally efficient filtering operation instead of top-k operations, preserving model quality better than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between HBM and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate attention methods reduce computational and memory overhead but rely on expensive top-k operations that perform poorly on GPUs.

Method: SiftAttention replaces the top-k step with an element-wise filtering operation based on a threshold value. The threshold value is dynamically estimated per prompt at each generation step according to the predictable power-law of the τ-th quantile of attention scores over sequential generation steps. Only attention scores above this threshold and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention output.

Result: SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when loading value vectors.

Conclusion: SiftAttention addresses the challenge of memory bandwidth limitations in GPU-based inference for large language models by introducing a computationally efficient filtering operation that outperforms traditional top-k operations.

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

*Florentin Guth,Zahra Kadkhodaie,Eero P Simoncelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new framework for learning normalized energy models inspired by diffusion generative models, modifies score network architecture to compute energy while preserving inductive biases, and trains an energy network with a dual score matching objective on ImageNet64 dataset achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning probability models from data is crucial but difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. Traditional methods do not provide consistent and normalized energies across noise levels.

Method: A score network architecture is modified to compute an energy while preserving its inductive biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density optimized using a denoising objective. A novel secondary objective optimizes the gradient with respect to the noise level providing an additional score ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels.

Result: The energy network trained with the dual score matching objective on the ImageNet64 dataset achieves a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable to the state of the art. Estimated log probabilities are nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Both image probability and dimensionality of local neighborhoods vary significantly with image content.

Conclusion: The new framework for learning normalized energy models provides consistent and normalized energies across noise levels, strongly generalizes, and demonstrates that image probability and dimensionality vary significantly with image content.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

*Yifan Sun,Jingyan Shen,Yibin Wang,Tianyu Chen,Zhendong Wang,Mingyuan Zhou,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning, reducing time by 25% to 65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive and lacks focus on data efficiency.

Method: The proposed methods are difficulty-targeted online data selection using adaptive difficulty and rollout replay to reuse recent rollouts.

Result: Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations demonstrate a reduction in RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Conclusion: The introduced techniques significantly enhance data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning, reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper presents LSM-2 with AIM, a novel SSL method using learnable mask tokens for handling incomplete wearable sensor data without explicit imputation. Pre-trained on 40M hours of data, it excels in various tasks and missingness scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable sensor data often has significant missingness, which challenges traditional SSL models assuming complete data inputs.

Method: Introduced LSM-2 with AIM that uses learnable mask tokens to model both existing and artificial missingness, allowing robust learning directly from incomplete data.

Result: Achieves best performance across classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks, shows superior scaling performance, and maintains high performance under targeted missingness scenarios.

Conclusion: LSM-2 with AIM is a reliable choice for real-world wearable data applications.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AI的两步学习策略框架，用于从多散射体图像中提取准粒子干涉（QPI）核。该方法通过训练变分自编码器学习紧凑的散射核潜在空间，并使用专用编码器将QPI观察的潜在表示与预学习的核对齐，从而在复杂散射条件下也能稳健地推断核。实验表明，该方法相比直接一步基线方法，提取精度显著提高且对未见核具有更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从多散射体图像中提取单散射体QPI模式（即核）是一个基本的病态逆问题，传统方法难以解决。

Method: 提出一种基于AI的两步学习策略：第一步，训练变分自编码器学习散射核的紧凑潜在空间；第二步，使用专用编码器将QPI观察的潜在表示与预学习的核对齐，以实现稳健的核推断。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在提取精度上显著优于直接一步基线方法，并对未见核展现出更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的两步学习策略能够有效解决QPI核提取中的病态逆问题，在复杂散射条件下表现稳健，为量子材料电子结构研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

TL;DR: 重新思考测试时间扩展定律，提出更小模型的效果被显著高估，并揭示了新的动力学扩展定律和稀疏注意力的扩展范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前基于计算最优的研究忽视了推理时间策略（如Best-of-$N$，长CoTs）引入的关键内存访问瓶颈。因此，作者从实际效率的角度重新思考测试时间扩展定律。

Method: 通过跨越0.6B到32B参数模型的全面分析，揭示新的动力学扩展定律，该定律结合了计算和内存访问成本。提出以稀疏注意力为中心的新扩展范式，降低每令牌成本并允许更长生成和平行样本。

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在低资源和高资源条件下均优于密集模型，在AIME问题解决准确性上获得显著提升，并且在最先进的MoEs评估中表现良好。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力对于实现测试时间扩展的全部潜力至关重要，因为测试时间准确性可以通过增加生成继续提高，而不像训练时参数扩展会饱和。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了通过嫁接预训练扩散变压器（DiTs）来设计新模型架构的方法，这种方法成本低且高效。实验表明，许多混合设计在使用不到2%的预训练计算资源的情况下，能够达到良好的模型质量。此外，嫁接技术还被应用于文本到图像模型（PixArt-Sigma），实现了1.43倍的速度提升，同时GenEval分数下降不到2%。最后，通过将每对连续的变压器块转换为平行块，模型深度减少了一半，质量却优于其他深度相当的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计模型架构需要做出诸如选择操作符（例如注意力、卷积）和配置（例如深度、宽度）等决策。然而，评估这些决策对模型质量的影响需要昂贵的预训练过程，限制了架构的探索。受新软件建立在现有代码之上的启发，研究者提出是否可以利用预训练模型来研究新的架构设计。

Method: 研究者提出了嫁接方法，这是一种通过编辑预训练扩散变压器（DiTs）来实现新架构的简单方法，计算预算较小。基于对激活行为和注意力局部性的分析，构建了一个基于DiT-XL/2设计的测试平台，以研究嫁接对模型质量的影响。通过该测试平台，开发了一系列混合设计，包括用门控卷积、局部注意力和线性注意力替换softmax注意力，以及用不同扩展比和卷积变体替换MLPs。

Result: 许多混合设计在使用不到2%的预训练计算资源的情况下，达到了良好的质量（FID：2.38-2.64对比DiT-XL/2的2.27）。在文本到图像模型（PixArt-Sigma）上应用嫁接技术，实现了1.43倍的速度提升，同时GenEval分数下降不到2%。通过将每对连续的变压器块转换为平行块，模型深度减少了一半，质量却优于其他深度相当的模型（FID：2.77）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过嫁接预训练扩散模型（DiTs），可以有效地探索新的扩散模型设计，从操作符替换到架构重构都可以实现。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在Transformer大语言模型中，生成成本主要受限于KV缓存的大小，而非生成标记的数量。因此，研究者希望探索推理时间超级扩展技术，通过压缩KV缓存，在不增加计算成本的情况下生成更多标记，进一步提高推理准确性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Dynamic Memory Sparsification（DMS）的新方法，用于稀疏化KV缓存。该方法仅需1K训练步骤即可实现8倍压缩，并且在高压缩比下仍能保持准确性。与无训练的稀疏注意力相比，DMS延迟了标记的驱逐，隐式地合并表示并保留关键信息。

Result: 在多个LLM家族上验证了推理时间超级扩展结合DMS的有效性，证明其可以在相似的推理运行时间和内存负载下提升准确性。例如，Qwen-R1 32B在AIME、GPQA和LiveCodeBench上的表现分别平均提升了9.1、7.6和9.6分。

Conclusion: Dynamic Memory Sparsification（DMS）作为一种新型KV缓存稀疏化方法，成功实现了推理时间超级扩展，提高了LLM的推理准确性，同时保持了可接受的运行时间和内存消耗。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

### [159] [The Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR) Problem: From Symbolic Path Inversion to Post-Quantum Cryptographic Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04383)
*Mohamed Aly Bouke*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR), a new non-algebraic cryptographic construction based on symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations, which is resistant to quantum attacks. HFKR builds on the Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP) and uses hash-based obfuscation to generate fixed-length cryptographic keys. Experimental results show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 are effective in amplifying symbolic divergence, while BLAKE3 shows weaker diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities of classical cryptographic systems to quantum attacks and structural cryptanalysis, there is a need for a new cryptographic construction that does not rely on structured algebraic problems.

Method: HFKR is built on SPIP, using symbolic trajectories generated via contractive affine maps over Z^2 and compressing them into fixed-length cryptographic keys through hash-based obfuscation. The fractal behavior of these symbolic paths is confirmed empirically, with a fractal dimension stabilizing near 1.06.

Result: Experimental results across 250 perturbation trials demonstrate that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 effectively amplify symbolic divergence, achieving high mean Hamming distances, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible entropy deviation. BLAKE3 shows statistically uniform but weaker diffusion.

Conclusion: HFKR provides a lightweight, structure-free foundation for secure key generation, relying on the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy amplification, making it suitable for post-quantum security.

Abstract: Classical cryptographic systems rely heavily on structured algebraic
problems, such as factorization, discrete logarithms, or lattice-based
assumptions, which are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks and
structural cryptanalysis. In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal
Key Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction
grounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the
Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories
generated via contractive affine maps over $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them
into fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key
contribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic
paths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path
geometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension
increases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic
self-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the
entropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation
trials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively,
achieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible
entropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but
weaker diffusion. These findings confirm that HFKR post-quantum security arises
from the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy
amplification. The resulting construction offers a lightweight, structure-free
foundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings without relying on
algebraic hardness assumptions.

TL;DR: RAG系统容易受到注入毒化段落的攻击，即使在低污染率下。现有的攻击并非设计为隐蔽，因此可以可靠地检测和缓解。我们通过基于区分性的安全游戏形式化隐蔽性，并提出了一种基于注意力模式的方法来识别和过滤可能被毒化的段落。同时，我们也设计了更隐蔽的自适应攻击以测试防御极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统对注入毒化段落的攻击很脆弱，但现有攻击不够隐蔽，因此可以通过检测其痕迹来进行防御。

Method: 1. 提出基于区分性的安全游戏形式化隐蔽性概念。
2. 利用注意力模式，提出归一化段落注意分数和注意力方差过滤算法，用于识别和过滤潜在毒化段落。
3. 设计更隐蔽的自适应攻击以测试基于注意力的防御方法的极限。

Result: 所提出的方法能够有效缓解现有攻击，准确率比基线防御提高了约20%。然而，更隐蔽的自适应攻击仍能达到35%的成功率，显示出提升隐蔽性的挑战。

Conclusion: 尽管提出的注意力模式方法能有效防御现有攻击，但更隐蔽的攻击仍然是一个挑战，需要进一步研究以提高防御和攻击的隐蔽性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text. Through experiments on 2 datasets and 3 models, they observe a clear privacy-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data in radiology reports and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}. Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1 score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base.

Result: A clear privacy-utility trade-off was observed. Under moderate privacy guarantees, the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.

Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports.

{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

*Xuhao Ren,Haotian Liang,Yajie Wang,Chuan Zhang,Zehui Xiong,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes BESA, a method to improve encoder stealing attacks by detecting and recovering perturbations, increasing accuracy by up to 24.63%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome perturbation-based defenses that hinder the performance of encoder stealing attacks.

Method: BESA includes two modules: perturbation detection (to infer defense mechanisms) and perturbation recovery (to restore clean feature vectors using a generative model). These can be combined with existing encoder stealing attacks.

Result: BESA improves surrogate encoder accuracy by up to 24.63% over existing methods when facing advanced defenses.

Conclusion: BESA significantly boosts the effectiveness of encoder stealing attacks against perturbation-based defenses.

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

### [163] [Incentivizing Collaborative Breach Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04634)
*Mridu Nanda,Michael K. Reiter*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种算法，通过站点间互相监控蜜词（honeywords）来检测密码泄露，并证明了该算法在实际数据集上的可扩展性和可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用蜜词检测密码泄露的方法存在不足，因为攻击者可以通过凭证填充攻击识别出真实密码，而不触发警报。此外，尚不清楚网站参与此类监控的动机是什么。

Method: 作者设计并评估了一种算法，使网站之间能够交换监控服务。通过模型验证分析，展示了当一个网站增加为其他网站进行监控的努力时，其自身检测到被入侵的能力也会提高。

Result: 模型检查分析表明，该算法可以有效提升检测能力；并且量化了不同参数对检测效果的影响以及部署支持监控生态系统的系统的影响。最后，使用真实的泄露凭据数据集对该算法进行了评估，结果证实了其可扩展性和实际可行性。

Conclusion: 提出的算法为网站提供了一个有效的机制，以激励它们参与蜜词监控生态系统，从而提高了整体安全性。

Abstract: Decoy passwords, or "honeywords," alert a site to its breach if they are ever
entered in a login attempt on that site. However, an attacker can identify a
user-chosen password from among the decoys, without risk of alerting the site
to its breach, by performing credential stuffing, i.e., entering the stolen
passwords at another site where the same user reused her password. Prior work
has thus proposed that sites monitor for the entry of their honeywords at other
sites. Unfortunately, it is not clear what incentives sites have to participate
in this monitoring. In this paper we propose and evaluate an algorithm by which
sites can exchange monitoring favors. Through a model-checking analysis, we
show that using our algorithm, a site improves its ability to detect its own
breach when it increases the monitoring effort it expends for other sites. We
additionally quantify the impacts of various parameters on detection
effectiveness and their implications for the deployment of a system to support
a monitoring ecosystem. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on a real dataset of
breached credentials and provide a performance analysis that confirms its
scalability and practical viability.

*Zixian Gong,Zhiyong Zheng,Zhe Hu,Kun Tian,Yi Zhang,Zhedanov Oleksiy,Fengxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Private Set Intersection (PSI) is improved with data integrity protection through authenticated schemes, though at higher costs than unauthenticated ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PSI protocols are vulnerable to data integrity attacks, which allow malicious participants to extract extra intersection information or mislead others.

Method: Two authenticated PSI schemes are constructed by integrating Merkle Trees with existing two-party volePSI and multi-party mPSI protocols.

Result: The two-party authenticated PSI achieves communication complexity $\mathcal{O}(n \lambda+n \log n)$, while the multi-party construction is $\mathcal{O}(n \kappa+n \log n)$ with additional overhead due to Merkle tree inclusion proofs.

Conclusion: Authenticated PSI schemes provide data integrity protection but incur higher costs; efficient implementations and potential improvements are discussed.

Abstract: Private Set Intersection (PSI) enables secure computation of set
intersections while preserving participant privacy, standard PSI existing
protocols remain vulnerable to data integrity attacks allowing malicious
participants to extract additional intersection information or mislead other
parties. In this paper, we propose the definition of data integrity in PSI and
construct two authenticated PSI schemes by integrating Merkle Trees with
state-of-the-art two-party volePSI and multi-party mPSI protocols. The
resulting two-party authenticated PSI achieves communication complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n \lambda+n \log n)$, aligning with the best-known unauthenticated
PSI schemes, while the multi-party construction is $\mathcal{O}(n \kappa+n \log
n)$ which introduces additional overhead due to Merkle tree inclusion proofs.
Due to the incorporation of integrity verification, our authenticated schemes
incur higher costs compared to state-of-the-art unauthenticated schemes. We
also provide efficient implementations of our protocols and discuss potential
improvements, including alternative authentication blocks.

TL;DR: This paper presents MULTISS, a protocol for long-term storage distributed across multiple QKD networks using hierarchical secret sharing, which is proved to be more secure than LINCOS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the secure storage protocol LINCOS to a new protocol that can distribute secrets across multiple QKD networks with perfect security.

Method: Using hierarchical secret sharing to distribute a secret across multiple QKD networks and allowing for sharing updates without reconstructing the entire secret.

Result: MULTISS is strictly more secure than LINCOS and can still function securely even if one of the QKD networks is compromised.

Conclusion: The MULTISS protocol provides a more secure method for long-term storage distributed across multiple QKD networks compared to LINCOS.

Abstract: This paper presents MULTISS, a new protocol for long-term storage distributed
across multiple Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks. This protocol is an
extension of LINCOS, a secure storage protocol that uses Shamir secret sharing
for secret storage on a single QKD network. Our protocol uses hierarchical
secret sharing to distribute a secret across multiple QKD networks while
ensuring perfect security. Our protocol further allows for sharing updates
without having to reconstruct the entire secret. We also prove that MULTISS is
strictly more secure than LINCOS, which remains vulnerable when its QKD network
is compromised.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）通过结合上下文学习和检索增强生成（RAG）来自动进行攻击缓解策略合规性的框架。该系统收集并管理工具和API规范，将其存储在向量数据库中以便高效检索相关信息。接着，将高层次的缓解策略分解为离散任务，并将每个任务转化为一组可操作的API调用。实验证明，在使用公开的CTI策略和Windows API文档时，与非RAG基线相比，采用RAG方法在精确度、召回率和F1分数上均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代计算环境的复杂性和网络威胁的日益复杂要求更强大、适应性更强以及更自动化的安全实施方法。传统的安全方法可能无法有效应对这些挑战，因此需要一种新的自动化方法来处理攻击缓解策略的合规性。

Method: 该方法首先收集并管理工具和API规范，并将它们存储在向量数据库中以实现高效的信息检索。然后，通过架构管道将高级别的缓解策略分解成离散的任务，并将每个任务转换为一组可执行的API调用。此过程利用了大型语言模型（LLMs）和检索增强生成（RAG）技术。

Result: 实验评估显示，使用RAG方法相较于非RAG基线，在精确度、召回率和F1分数方面都有显著提高。这表明所提出的框架能够更有效地实现攻击缓解策略的合规性。

Conclusion: 利用大型语言模型和RAG技术的框架可以显著提高攻击缓解策略合规性的自动化水平和效果。这种方法不仅提升了安全实施的效率，还增强了其应对复杂网络威胁的能力。

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving smart wallet with an invitation-based private onboarding mechanism is proposed, integrating two levels of compliance and demonstrating practical efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a privacy-preserving, compliance-aware digital payment solution that minimizes computational and financial overhead.

Method: The solution incorporates a proof of innocence mechanism, an ancestral commitment tracking system using bloom filters, encrypted data blobs for private contact list management, and probabilistic UTXO chain states. Private transfers with compliance checks are performed efficiently on consumer-grade hardware.

Result: Performance analysis shows that private transfers with compliance checks complete within seconds, proof generation remains low, and on-chain costs are minimal, ensuring affordability for all operations on Base layer 2 network.

Conclusion: The evaluation confirms the approach's effectiveness for privacy-preserving, compliance-aware digital payments with minimized computational and financial overhead.

Abstract: We propose a privacy-preserving smart wallet with a novel invitation-based
private onboarding mechanism. The solution integrates two levels of compliance
in concert with an authority party: a proof of innocence mechanism and an
ancestral commitment tracking system using bloom filters for probabilistic UTXO
chain states. Performance analysis demonstrates practical efficiency: private
transfers with compliance checks complete within seconds on a consumer-grade
laptop, and overall with proof generation remaining low. On-chain costs stay
minimal, ensuring affordability for all operations on Base layer 2 network. The
wallet facilitates private contact list management through encrypted data blobs
while maintaining transaction unlinkability. Our evaluation validates the
approach's viability for privacy-preserving, compliance-aware digital payments
with minimized computational and financial overhead.

*Deniz Simsek,Aryaz Eghbali,Michael Pradel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PoCGen是一种新方法，它结合大型语言模型和静态、动态分析技术，自动为npm包中的漏洞生成并验证概念验证（PoC）利用。在SecBench.js数据集上成功率为77%，在一个更具挑战性的新数据集上成功率为39%，显著优于现有基线方法（高出45个百分点），且每次生成的平均成本仅为0.02美元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件包中的安全漏洞对开发者和用户都是重要问题，及时修复这些漏洞对于恢复软件系统的完整性和安全性至关重要。然而，现有的漏洞报告通常缺乏概念验证（PoC）利用，这使得修复漏洞、测试补丁以及避免回归变得困难。由于漏洞报告往往是非正式和不完整的，并且需要详细了解输入如何到达安全相关的接收器，因此创建PoC利用具有很大挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种名为PoCGen的新方法，该方法首次完全自主地将大型语言模型（LLMs）与静态和动态分析技术结合使用，以生成和验证漏洞的概念验证（PoC）利用。具体来说，PoCGen利用LLM来理解漏洞报告、生成候选PoC利用，并对其进行验证和优化。

Result: PoCGen在SecBench.js数据集上成功生成了77%的漏洞利用，在一个包含794个最新漏洞的新数据集上成功率为39%。这一成功率比最近的基线方法高出45个百分点，同时每次生成的平均成本仅为0.02美元。

Conclusion: PoCGen展示了其在自主生成和验证PoC利用方面的高效性和经济性，为解决软件漏洞修复中的关键问题提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in software packages are a significant concern for
developers and users alike. Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner
is crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.
However, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack
proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the
vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC
exploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often
incomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs
passed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In
this paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and
validate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first
fully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with
static and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen
leverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating
candidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach
successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the
SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent
vulnerabilities. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline
(by 45 absolute percentage points), while imposing an average cost of $0.02 per
generated exploit.

TL;DR: The paper explores a query obfuscation strategy to protect user privacy in search engines by generating random multilingual queries, showing its effectiveness in disrupting user profiling and providing a practical tool for users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search engines personalize results through detailed user profiles, enhancing relevance but introducing privacy risks and filter bubbles.

Method: Proposes a lightweight, client-side query obfuscation strategy using random multilingual queries; evaluates its impact through controlled experiments on Seznam.cz with different language configurations and ratios.

Result: Obfuscation maintains stable search results while significantly altering perceived user interests, preventing accurate profiling and overwriting existing profiles.

Conclusion: Query obfuscation is a viable privacy-preserving mechanism, supported by a tool enabling autonomous user protection without infrastructure changes.

Abstract: Modern search engines extensively personalize results by building detailed
user profiles based on query history and behaviour. While personalization can
enhance relevance, it introduces privacy risks and can lead to filter bubbles.
This paper proposes and evaluates a lightweight, client-side query obfuscation
strategy using randomly generated multilingual search queries to disrupt user
profiling. Through controlled experiments on the Seznam.cz search engine, we
assess the impact of interleaving real queries with obfuscating noise in
various language configurations and ratios. Our findings show that while
displayed search results remain largely stable, the search engine's identified
user interests shift significantly under obfuscation. We further demonstrate
that such random queries can prevent accurate profiling and overwrite
established user profiles. This study provides practical evidence for query
obfuscation as a viable privacy-preserving mechanism and introduces a tool that
enables users to autonomously protect their search behaviour without modifying
existing infrastructure.

Result: The FL implementation is presented as a feasible solution with a thorough evaluation comparing it to a centralized version of the same algorithm.

Conclusion: Federated Learning can be effectively integrated into machine learning-based intrusion detection processes for on-board vehicular networks.

Abstract: The challenges derived from the data-intensive nature of machine learning in
conjunction with technologies that enable novel paradigms such as V2X and the
potential offered by 5G communication, allow and justify the deployment of
Federated Learning (FL) solutions in the vehicular intrusion detection domain.
In this paper, we investigate the effects of integrating FL strategies into the
machine learning-based intrusion detection process for on-board vehicular
networks. Accordingly, we propose a FL implementation of a state-of-the-art
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Controller Area Network (CAN), based on
LSTM autoencoders. We thoroughly evaluate its detection efficiency and
communication overhead, comparing it to a centralized version of the same
algorithm, thereby presenting it as a feasible solution.

Result: Evaluations show that FEAD achieves 8.23% higher F1-score than existing solutions with only 5.4% overhead.

Conclusion: Focus-based designs significantly enhance detection performance.

Abstract: Traditional security detection methods face three key challenges: inadequate
data collection that misses critical security events, resource-intensive
monitoring systems, and poor detection algorithms with high false positive
rates. We present FEAD (Focus-Enhanced Attack Detection), a framework that
addresses these issues through three innovations: (1) an attack model-driven
approach that extracts security-critical monitoring items from online attack
reports for comprehensive coverage; (2) efficient task decomposition that
optimally distributes monitoring across existing collectors to minimize
overhead; and (3) locality-aware anomaly analysis that leverages the clustering
behavior of malicious activities in provenance graphs to improve detection
accuracy. Evaluations demonstrate FEAD achieves 8.23% higher F1-score than
existing solutions with only 5.4% overhead, confirming that focus-based designs

*Robert J. Joyce,Gideon Miller,Phil Roth,Richard Zak,Elliott Zaresky-Williams,Hyrum Anderson,Edward Raff,James Holt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EMBER2024 is a new dataset for malware analysis which includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors, and labels for over 3.2 million files from six file formats, supporting seven malware classification tasks and featuring a 'challenge' set of initially undetected malicious files.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accessible data in malware analysis research and overcome limitations of existing public datasets that are narrow in scope, rely on single-platform files, support only one type of malware classification task, and do not capture evasive files.

Method: Created EMBER2024 dataset in collaboration with authors of EMBER2017 and EMBER2018, including hashes, metadata, feature vectors, and labels for over 3.2 million files across six file formats, supporting seven malware classification tasks, introducing a 'challenge' set of undetected malicious files, and releasing EMBER feature version 3 with new feature types.

Result: EMBER2024 enables holistic evaluation of malware classifiers, supports training and evaluation of machine learning models on multiple classification tasks, and provides a 'challenge' set to assess performance against evasive malware.

Conclusion: The release of EMBER2024 promotes reproducibility and empowers researchers to explore new malware research topics.

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

*Lorenzo Rossi,Michael Aerni,Jie Zhang,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Sequence models like LLMs and autoregressive image generators tend to memorize and leak sensitive information. Existing tools are insufficient for auditing risks due to mismatched assumptions. The study argues that measuring privacy leakage requires leveraging correlations in sequential generation. By adapting a membership inference attack to model within-sequence correlations, the adaptations improve memorization audits' effectiveness without extra computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence models have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive information, which has critical legal implications. However, existing tools are insufficient to audit these risks effectively.

Method: The researchers adapted a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model within-sequence correlations in sequence models. This approach leverages the inherent correlations in sequential generation to measure privacy leakage more effectively.

Result: The adaptations consistently improved the effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional computational costs, as demonstrated through a case study.

Conclusion: This work serves as an important step towards reliable memorization audits for large sequence models by highlighting the importance of leveraging within-sequence correlations.

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

*Andrin Bertschi,Shweta Shinde*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: OpenCCA is an open research platform that allows execution of CCA-bound code on commodity Armv8.2 hardware, overcoming the absence of hardware support for Arm CCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenges faced in researching Arm CCA due to the lack of hardware support, which leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent performance comparisons, and high barriers to entry.

Method: By systematically adapting the software stack including bootloader, firmware, hypervisor, and kernel, OpenCCA emulates CCA operations for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness.

Result: The effectiveness of OpenCCA is demonstrated through typical life-cycle measurements and case-studies inspired by prior CCA-based papers on a easily available Armv8.2 Rockchip board.

Conclusion: OpenCCA provides a solution for researchers to evaluate CCA operations without requiring dedicated hardware, enabling more consistent and accessible research in this area.

Abstract: Confidential computing has gained traction across major architectures with
Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and Arm CCA. Unlike TDX and SEV-SNP, a key challenge in
researching Arm CCA is the absence of hardware support, forcing researchers to
develop ad-hoc performance prototypes on non-CCA Arm boards. This approach
leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent performance comparisons, and high
barriers to entry. To address this, we present OpenCCA, an open research
platform that enables the execution of CCA-bound code on commodity Armv8.2
hardware. By systematically adapting the software stack -- including
bootloader, firmware, hypervisor, and kernel -- OpenCCA emulates CCA operations
for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness. We
demonstrate its effectiveness with typical life-cycle measurements and
case-studies inspired by prior CCA-based papers on a easily available Armv8.2
Rockchip board that costs $250.

*Zhiqiang Wang,Haohua Du,Junyang Wang,Haifeng Sun,Kaiwen Guo,Haikuo Yu,Chao Liu,Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SECNEURON is a framework that embeds access control within LLMs to prevent abuse in local deployment environments. It uses neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to control task-specific capabilities, ensuring security without compromising authorized tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security and controllability challenges of locally deployed LLMs, which are more susceptible to abuse compared to cloud-based services.

Method: SECNEURON employs neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to dynamically control task-specific capabilities of LLMs. A task-specific neuron extraction mechanism decouples logically related neurons and constructs a layered policy tree for handling coupled neurons. A hybrid encryption framework is introduced for efficient encryption of millions of neurons. Lastly, a distribution-based decrypted neuron detection mechanism ensures effectiveness.

Result: SECNEURON limits unauthorized task accuracy to below 25% while maintaining authorized accuracy with only 2% loss. In an example with unauthorized code generation, accuracy was reduced from 59% to 15%. It also mitigates unauthorized data leakage, reducing PII extraction rates to below 5% and membership inference to random guesses.

Conclusion: SECNEURON satisfies IND-CPA Security and Collusion Resistance Security under the Task Controllability Principle. The framework provides reliable, cost-effective, flexible, and certified abuse control for local deployed LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities are increasingly being
deployed in local environments, presenting significant security and
controllability challenges. These locally deployed LLMs operate outside the
direct control of developers, rendering them more susceptible to abuse.
Existing mitigation techniques mainly designed for cloud-based LLM services are
frequently circumvented or ineffective in deployer-controlled environments. We
propose SECNEURON, the first framework that seamlessly embeds classic access
control within the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs, achieving reliable,
cost-effective, flexible, and certified abuse control for local deployed LLMs.
SECNEURON employs neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to
dynamically control the task-specific capabilities of LLMs, limiting
unauthorized task abuse without compromising others. We first design a
task-specific neuron extraction mechanism to decouple logically related neurons
and construct a layered policy tree for handling coupled neurons. We then
introduce a flexible and efficient hybrid encryption framework for millions of
neurons in LLMs. Finally, we developed a distribution-based decrypted neuron
detection mechanism on ciphertext to ensure the effectiveness of partially
decrypted LLMs. We proved that SECNEURON satisfies IND-CPA Security and
Collusion Resistance Security under the Task Controllability Principle.
Experiments on various task settings show that SECNEURON limits unauthorized
task accuracy to below 25% while keeping authorized accuracy loss with 2%.
Using an unauthorized Code task example, the accuracy of abuse-related
malicious code generation was reduced from 59% to 15%. SECNEURON also mitigates
unauthorized data leakage, reducing PII extraction rates to below 5% and
membership inference to random guesses.

*Pierre Tholoniat,Alison Caulfield,Giorgio Cavicchioli,Mark Chen,Nikos Goutzoulias,Benjamin Case,Asaf Cidon,Roxana Geambasu,Mathias Lécuyer,Martin Thomson*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Privacy-Preserving Attribution (PPA) is an advertising API designed to protect web privacy while enabling ad measurement. However, current designs lack a principled approach to privacy budget management. Therefore, the authors propose Big Bird, a privacy budget manager for PPA that clarifies per-site budget semantics and introduces a global budgeting system grounded in resource isolation principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving advertising APIs like PPA are crucial for enhancing web privacy while allowing effective ad measurement. But there is uncertainty around critical design decisions due to the lack of a principled approach to privacy budget management.

Method: The authors present Big Bird, which enforces utility-preserving limits via quota budgets and improves global budget utilization through a novel batched scheduling algorithm. These mechanisms establish a robust foundation for enforcing privacy protections in adversarial environments.

Result: Big Bird was implemented in Firefox and evaluated on real-world ad data, demonstrating its resilience and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Big Bird provides a solution to the problem of privacy budget management in PPA, offering clear per-site budget semantics and a global budgeting system.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving advertising APIs like Privacy-Preserving Attribution (PPA)
are designed to enhance web privacy while enabling effective ad measurement.
PPA offers an alternative to cross-site tracking with encrypted reports
governed by differential privacy (DP), but current designs lack a principled
approach to privacy budget management, creating uncertainty around critical
design decisions. We present Big Bird, a privacy budget manager for PPA that
clarifies per-site budget semantics and introduces a global budgeting system
grounded in resource isolation principles. Big Bird enforces utility-preserving
limits via quota budgets and improves global budget utilization through a novel
batched scheduling algorithm. Together, these mechanisms establish a robust
foundation for enforcing privacy protections in adversarial environments. We
implement Big Bird in Firefox and evaluate it on real-world ad data,
demonstrating its resilience and effectiveness.

### [177] [Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05346)
*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in LLMs reveal their vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks. Current mitigation strategies focus on downstream fine-tuning, but overlook the role of original safety-alignment data. This paper investigates the degradation of safety guardrails through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of LLMs to safety alignment jailbreaks by investigating the role of upstream safety-alignment data and its impact on the robustness of safety guardrails during downstream fine-tuning.

Method: The method involves analyzing the representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks to determine its effect on the degradation of safety guardrails.

Result: Experiments show that high similarity between these datasets weakens safety guardrails, making models more susceptible to jailbreaks, while low similarity yields more robust models and reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of upstream dataset design for durable safety guardrails and offer actionable insights for reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

### [178] [Spore in the Wild: Case Study on Spore.fun, a Real-World Experiment of Sovereign Agent Open-ended Evolution on Blockchain with TEEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04236)
*Botao Amber Hu,Helena Rong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores Spore.fun, a real-world AI evolution experiment enabling autonomous breeding and evolution of on-chain agents. It examines agent behaviors through digital ethology and discusses whether 'open' ALife systems could achieve Open-Ended Evolution (OEE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional closed system simulations in ALife research have failed to sustain OEE after an initial burst of novelty. The need for an 'open' system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment is suggested to be crucial for achieving sustained OEE.

Method: The study presents a case study of Spore.fun, analyzing the behaviors and evolutionary trajectories of on-chain agents through digital ethology. These agents operate autonomously on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and can interact with blockchain-based financial networks and human social media.

Result: The analysis of Spore.fun provides insights into the potential of 'open' ALife systems based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to achieve sustained OEE.

Conclusion: The paper aims to initiate discussions on whether 'open' ALife systems 'in-the-wild' could finally realize the long-sought goal of OEE.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

### [179] [CORA: Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition for Multi-Agent Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04265)
*Mengda Ji,Genjiu Xu,Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper tackles the credit assignment problem in cooperative MARL by proposing CORA, which ensures coalitional rationality and outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit assignment in cooperative MARL often leads to suboptimal policy updates due to lack of consideration for distinct agent contributions; existing methods overlook detailed coalition-level analysis.

Method: CORA evaluates coalitional advantages through marginal contributions of all possible coalitions and decomposes them using the core solution from cooperative game theory, ensuring coalitional rationality. Random coalition sampling is used to reduce computational cost.

Result: Experiments show that CORA outperforms strong baselines in matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks, especially in tasks with multiple local optima.

Conclusion: Coalition-aware credit assignment, as implemented in CORA, is crucial for enhancing performance in cooperative MARL.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

*Lei Han,Yitong Guo,Pengfei Yang,Zhiyong Yu,Liang Wang,Quan Wang,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoAs-PALN, an algorithm for efficient post-disaster environmental information collection via autonomous collaboration among UAVs, workers, and vehicles. It uses adaptive dimensionality reduction and local Nash equilibrium game to improve scheduling decisions. Experiments show it improves task completion rates significantly compared to baselines while making quick decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters cause significant losses, and obtaining post-disaster environmental information is crucial for effective rescue operations. Current sensing technologies face challenges like weak adaptability and limited practicality.

Method: HoAs-PALN algorithm is developed which includes adaptive dimensionality reduction in the matching process (transforming a five-dimensional matching process into two categories of three-dimensional ones) and local Nash equilibrium game (using softmax function for optimization and introducing a determination mechanism).

Result: Experiments based on real-world and simulated data show that HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%, and 14.03% compared to GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL and MARL respectively, with each online scheduling decision taking less than 10 seconds.

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN demonstrates effectiveness in dynamic post-disaster environments by significantly improving task completion rates and reducing scheduling decision time.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，该代理不仅决定说什么，还决定什么时候说。通过在线Mafia游戏数据集评估，该代理在游戏表现和与人类玩家的融合能力上表现良好。分析表明，代理在决定何时发言方面模仿了人类模式，但在消息内容上存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要应用于同步通信中，而许多现实场景是异步的，例如群聊、在线团队会议或社交游戏中没有明确的轮流发言机制。因此，何时发言成为参与者决策的重要部分，需要开发一个适应异步环境的LLM代理。

Method: 研究者开发了一个自适应异步LLM代理，它不仅可以决定说什么，还可以决定什么时候说。他们收集了一个独特的在线Mafia游戏数据集，包括人类参与者和异步代理的表现进行评估。

Result: 整体而言，该代理的表现与人类玩家相当，无论是在游戏性能上还是在与其他人类玩家的融合能力上。分析显示，代理在决定何时发言方面的行为与人类模式非常相似，但在消息内容上存在差异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为将LLM集成到现实的人类群体环境中铺平了道路，从团队讨论中的辅助到需要导航复杂社交动态的教育和专业环境中。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

TL;DR: RoboRefer is a 3D-aware VLM that improves spatial understanding and reasoning through SFT and RFT training methods, outperforming existing models in complex 3D scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Even with pretrained vision language models, current approaches struggle to accurately understand complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about locations for interaction.

Method: Propose RoboRefer which integrates a disentangled depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for precise spatial understanding and uses reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) for generalized multi-step spatial reasoning. Introduce RefSpatial dataset and RefSpatial-Bench benchmark for training and evaluation.

Result: SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer surpasses other baselines by a large margin, beating Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench.

Conclusion: RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots in cluttered real-world scenes.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical framework combining LLM and VLM for heterogeneous multi-robot systems, enhancing adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems have great potential in complex tasks requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation, but traditional approaches relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic environments.

Method: The method involves a hierarchical framework integrating a prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic map construction while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D spatial information from aerial images to support local planning.

Result: Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: This work represents the first demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based

Result: Numerical experiments in Isaac Sim environment demonstrated significantly increased success rates in difficult navigation scenarios.

Conclusion: Using a 3D scene graph in reinforcement learning can greatly improve the success rate in complex navigation tasks.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the

the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for

the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also
employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the
agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the
training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more
advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim
environment showed that using a 3D scene graph for reinforcement learning
significantly increased the success rate in difficult navigation cases. The

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a generalized calibration method for robots using Olfactory Inertial Odometry (OIO) to achieve high precision in localizing an odor source, applicable in robotic surgery and security screening.

Method: Define a calibration process for OIO that works across various olfaction sensor types, focusing on achieving centimeter-level accuracy for slow-moving robots.

Result: Showcased enhanced performance in olfactory navigation tasks on a real robotic arm compared to a non-calibrated (cold-start) approach.

Conclusion: A defined calibration process for OIO can significantly improve the accuracy of odor source localization, proving valuable for specific applications like robotic surgery and touchless security screening.

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of extended measurement durations caused by high viscosity and slow mass transport in RTILs during chronoamperometry.

Method: Using a novel mathematical regression approach that applies an inference algorithm to the initial transient current response to predict steady-state electrochemical parameters.

Result: The method successfully reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second without additional hardware modifications, maintaining reasonable accuracy when compared to standard techniques.

Conclusion: This technique has significant implications for rapid electrochemical quantification in analytical chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science.

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed to enable fast, high-quality dose generation for online adaptive radiation therapy (oART) in intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). It achieved excellent performance across multiple disease sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is sensitive to anatomical changes and requires frequent adaptation through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast, accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. Thus, there is a need for a method to denoise low-statistics MC dose maps to enable fast, high-quality dose generation.

Method: The authors developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. They used IMPT plans and 3D CT images from 80 head and neck (H&N) patients to generate noisy and high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE.

Result: The model achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.195 Gy[RBE] (H&N), 0.120 Gy[RBE] (lung), 0.172 Gy[RBE] (breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92% (3%/2mm) across all sites. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and organs at risk (OARs) closely matched the ground truth.

Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed and demonstrated excellent generalization across multiple disease sites, despite being trained only on H&N data.

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Result: Structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks.

Conclusion: AbBiBench provides a unified framework for function-aware antibody design model development.

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

### [190] [The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515)
*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Latent Space Hypothesis to unify various medical data modalities into a shared geometric representation, enabling personalized diagnosis and treatment while acknowledging challenges such as bias, data scarcity, privacy, and causation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To interpret heterogeneous medical data in a shared space and re-examine conditions like Parkinson's or Crohn's that may involve multiple pathophysiological entities and broader anatomical domains than previously thought.

Method: Using the Latent Space Hypothesis which frames each observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold, allowing health status, disease progression, and therapeutic intervention to be represented geometrically.

Result: Reveals sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, providing a quantitative rationale for personalized diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment.

Conclusion: While challenges exist, scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and perturbation-based validation offer plausible solutions for advancing clinical practice.

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

*Osayamen Jonathan Aimuyo,Byungsoo Oh,Rachee Singh*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashDMoE is a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) operator that improves efficiency in large neural network training by optimizing GPU usage, reducing latency, and enhancing throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE model implementations have issues with low GPU utilization, high latency, and inability to leverage task locality due to CPU-managed scheduling and frequent kernel launches.

Method: Developed FlashDMoE, a fully GPU-resident MoE operator that combines expert computation and inter-GPU communication into one persistent GPU kernel, enabling fine-grained pipelining and efficient data transfers.

Result: FlashDMoE achieves significantly lower latency, higher throughput, better scaling efficiency, and much higher GPU utilization compared to current state-of-the-art baselines when tested on a single 8-H100 GPU node with large MoE models.

Conclusion: The success of FlashDMoE highlights the importance of co-designing GPU kernels and hardware for maximizing performance in large-scale distributed machine learning tasks.

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

### [192] [kTULA: A Langevin sampling algorithm with improved KL bounds under super-linear log-gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04878)
*Iosif Lytras,Sotirios Sabanis,Ying Zhang*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel algorithm called kTULA for sampling from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients in deep learning applications, providing theoretical guarantees and demonstrating its applicability through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In deep learning, the global Lipschitz continuity condition is often not satisfied, leading to challenges in sampling from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients.

Method: A tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm named kTULA is proposed to address the sampling problem. The method establishes a non-asymptotic convergence bound in KL divergence with an optimal rate of 2-ε̄ (ε̄>0).

Result: An improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance is achieved, which can further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for solving optimization problems. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through high-dimensional double-well potential distribution sampling and neural network optimization.

Conclusion: kTULA provides a theoretical guarantee for performance in sampling and optimization tasks, showing significant improvement over existing results.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

*Emiliano Acevedo,Martín Rocamora,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: In this paper, researchers find that audio-text models used for zero-shot environmental sound classification suffer performance drops when background sounds are present, especially related to SNR levels. They propose a new method to integrate background source contributions into classification without retraining, improving accuracy across different backgrounds and SNR conditions. Additionally, narrowing the modality gap between audio and text embeddings enhances classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of degraded performance in audio-text models for zero-shot environmental sound classification when background sounds are present, particularly focusing on the impact of SNR levels.

Method: The proposed method quantifies and integrates the contribution of background sources into the classification process without requiring model retraining. It also involves analyzing and narrowing the modality gap between audio and text embeddings.

Result: This domain adaptation technique improves accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Narrowing the modality gap between audio and text embeddings leads to better classification performance.

Conclusion: The method effectively generalizes across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, demonstrating scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

*Vishwa Mohan Singh,Sai Anirudh Aryasomayajula,Ahan Chatterjee,Beste Aydemir,Rifat Mehreen Amin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AI music generation models, despite being advanced, face challenges in personalization due to fixed datasets. This paper proposes a human-computation approach that uses user feedback via a genetic algorithm to improve model performance. Pilot tests showed an increase in user ratings with each iteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of AI music generation models trained on fixed datasets which cannot effectively interpret and respond to user input, leading to a lack of personalization.

Method: A human-computation approach is introduced where user ratings are aggregated and selected to serve as the loss function for fine-tuning a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. A genetic algorithm incorporating user feedback is used to iteratively enhance the model's performance.

Result: Pilot tests demonstrated an improvement in user ratings: an increase of 0.2 in the first iteration compared to the baseline, and an additional increase of 0.39 in the second iteration over the first iteration.

Conclusion: The human-computation approach using a genetic algorithm effectively improves the personalization and overall performance of AI music generation models through iterative user feedback.

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Neural ODE的数据驱动框架，用于从PDE控制的系统中学习降阶矩动力学。该方法在稀疏和不规则采样的情况下仍能准确恢复控制矩动力学，并通过数据驱动的坐标变换策略实现低维表示中的闭合矩动力学，适用于无解析闭合模型的系统。实验表明，Neural ODE在数据受限的情况下具有强大的外推能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的导数方法（如SINDy）需要密集采样数据且对噪声敏感，难以处理稀疏或不规则时间序列数据。因此，需要一种更鲁棒的方法来从数据中学习矩动力学。

Method: 采用Neural ODE直接建模矩轨迹，结合Stiefel流形优化的数据驱动坐标变换策略，发现低维表示中的闭合矩动力学。对于没有解析闭合模型的系统，使用Neural ODE近似未闭合的矩动力学。

Result: 在非线性薛定谔方程等应用中，能够准确恢复控制矩动力学；在Fisher-KPP反应扩散系统等无解析闭合模型的系统中，表现出优于物理专家衍生ODE模型的外推精度。

Conclusion: Neural ODE框架是一种强大而灵活的工具，可以学习复杂PDE控制系统的可解释、低维矩动力学，尤其在数据受限时表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

Conclusion: 提出了一种计算工具，用于检查从原始已知行为复制的可能复杂系统的信任度。

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

Result: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) show the highest robustness with near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors in predicting diffusivity and hydraulic conductivity.

Conclusion: SVMs and NNs are recommended for parameter identification in soil property estimation due to their robust performance.

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture

Result: Nonlinear models show significant improvements: 40-60% parameter reduction, 20-40% better coverage, FID scores of 0.0089 and 0.0156, 40-60% less memory usage, and 30-50% faster training time compared to linear models.

Conclusion: The work reveals deep connections between physical self-organization and AI, advancing both fields and opening new possibilities for optical computing.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep

*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: R2Rec is a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that leverages LLMs' semantic understanding and prompt flexibility to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on implicit patterns, achieving better performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs have shown success in recommendation tasks through their strong semantic understanding and prompt flexibility, applying advanced reasoning methods directly to recommendations is ineffective due to the lack of reasoning supervision from implicit user feedback. This work aims to address this gap by enhancing recommendations with reasoning capabilities.

Method: The proposed R2Rec framework samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into structured interaction-of-thoughts using a progressive masked prompting strategy. Each thought represents stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction context, allowing LLMs to simulate decision-making processes. A two-stage training pipeline is designed: supervised fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning skills from high-quality traces, while reinforcement learning refines reasoning abilities through reward signals.

Result: Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that R2Rec outperforms classical and LLM-based baselines, achieving an average 10.48% improvement in HitRatio@1 and a 131.81% gain over the original LLM. Additionally, the explicit reasoning chains improve interpretability by revealing the decision process.

Conclusion: R2Rec successfully integrates reasoning capabilities into recommendation systems, leveraging LLMs' strengths to enhance both performance and interpretability. The framework addresses the challenge of implicit user feedback and demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

*Bruno Deprez,Bart Baesens,Tim Verdonck,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Money laundering, especially through smurfing, is a significant challenge for financial institutions. Current anti-money laundering (AML) tools are often black-box models, limiting their adoption. This paper introduces GARG-AML, a graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk with an interpretable metric derived from the structure of second-order transaction networks. It balances computational efficiency, detection power, and transparency, enabling integration into existing AML workflows. Combining GARG-AML scores with tree-based methods and neighbor node scores improves its capabilities. Experiments show it outperforms state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Money laundering poses a significant threat to the global economy, prompting regulators to impose strict controls on financial institutions. Smurfing, a common money laundering technique, involves breaking large transactions into smaller ones to evade detection. Traditional AML methods have been predominantly black-box models, which has hindered their adoption in businesses due to lack of interpretability.

Method: The paper proposes GARG-AML, a novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk using an interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction network of each individual node. The method combines GARG-AML score calculation with different tree-based methods and incorporates the scores of neighboring nodes. It leverages the adjacency matrix of the second-order neighborhood and basic network features.

Result: Experimental evaluations on large-scale synthetic and open-source networks demonstrate that GARG-AML outperforms current state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. It achieves a balance among computational efficiency, detection power, and transparency.

Conclusion: GARG-AML provides a promising approach for smurfing detection by offering an interpretable metric derived from fundamental network properties. Its ability to integrate into existing AML workflows makes it a valuable tool for enhancing fraud detection.

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

TL;DR: The paper uses data from 1992 to 2022 to analyze how socioeconomic and demographic factors affect the type of crime experienced by victims, finding that higher income and education reduce violent crime victimization, while certain demographics face higher risks. The suburban models predict crime best, urban areas benefit from additional predictors, and rural crime remains hard to predict.

Motivation: To understand how socioeconomic factors (income, education, employment) and demographic factors (age, gender, race, marital status) influence whether individuals become victims of violent or property crimes.

Method: Uses logistic regression models with balanced classification splits evaluated by F1-score. Two groups of models are used: Group A focusing on socioeconomic drivers and Group B adding demographic factors.

Result: Higher income and education lower the odds of violent relative to property crime. Men, younger individuals, and racial minorities face higher risks of violent crime. Suburban models have the strongest predictive performance (accuracy 0.607, F1 0.590). Urban models benefit from adding education and employment predictors. Rural crime remains unpredictable using current factors.

Conclusion: There is a need for targeted interventions such as educational investments in metropolitan areas, economic support in rural communities, and demographic-aware prevention strategies.

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: An abstract about a new AI-driven framework cGSA which enhances Gene set analysis by incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GSA methods lack clinical context, leading to redundant or irrelevant results that require extensive manual effort to interpret, reducing reliability and reproducibility.

Method: cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify pathways that are both statistically significant and biologically meaningful.

Result: cGSA outperforms baseline methods by over 30% in benchmark tests on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases. Expert validation confirms increased precision and interpretability.

Conclusion: cGSA has the potential to uncover context-specific insights and support targeted hypothesis generation as demonstrated in case studies in melanoma and breast cancer.

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces hdl2v, a dataset that translates other hardware description languages to Verilog, enhancing LLM's Verilog generation. It improves an open-weight model by up to 23% in VerilogEvalV2 and boosts data augmentation-based fine-tuning by 63%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of publicly available Verilog code compared to software languages like Python, thereby improving the performance of large language models in generating Verilog.

Method: Creating the hdl2v dataset by translating VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 to Verilog. Using this dataset to enhance LLM Verilog generation without data augmentation or knowledge distillation, and demonstrating its effectiveness in boosting data augmentation-based fine-tuning.

Result: Improved performance of a 32 billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2 without data augmentation or knowledge distillation. Also, boosted data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%.

Conclusion: hdl2v is valuable in expanding the amount of human-written Verilog data, significantly enhancing LLMs' ability to generate Verilog code.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Processor chip design faces challenges due to fabrication technology, resource demands, and ecosystem diversity. AI and LLMs offer potential for fully automated design but have challenges. This paper introduces QiMeng, a system with three hierarchical layers (LPCM model, Hardware Design Agent, Software Design Agent) for automated hardware/software design of processor chips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processor chip design encounters difficulties such as physical constraints, increasing resource needs, and diverse ecosystems. The emergence of AI and LLM techniques provides opportunities for overcoming these issues through fully automated design.

Method: QiMeng is proposed, which includes: 1) Bottom-layer: a domain-specific Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM) addressing knowledge representation gap, data scarcity, correctness assurance, and large solution space via novel architecture, training, and inference designs; 2) Middle-layer: Hardware Design Agent and Software Design Agent leveraging LPCM's capabilities for automating hardware and software design; 3) Top-layer applications demonstrating the advantages of completed components.

Result: Several components of QiMeng have been successfully applied in various top-layer applications, showing significant advantages and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated hardware/software design of processor chips.

Conclusion: Future research will focus on integrating all components within QiMeng and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

TL;DR: The GAIN model uses a grid-based structure with the Izhikevich model for better biological plausibility and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve biological plausibility and dynamics of neural network models.

Method: Using a grid-based structure for neuron interactions and the Izhikevich model for simulation.

Result: This approach is computationally efficient and biologically accurate, improving the dynamics and accuracy of the model.

Conclusion: This method can aid in neural network development, large scale simulations, and neuroscience research.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale

the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

TL;DR: POSSM 是一种新的混合架构，结合了跨注意力模块和循环状态空间模型，用于快速因果在线预测神经活动和高效泛化。在多种任务中，POSSM 的解码准确性与最先进的 Transformer 相当，但推理成本仅为后者的九分之一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的实时神经解码方法要么速度和轻量级不足，要么计算需求大而不适合低资源或实时设置。需要一种新方法来平衡速度、准确性和泛化能力。

Method: POSSM 结合了个别尖峰标记化通过交叉注意力模块和一个循环状态空间模型（SSM）主干，支持快速因果在线预测和多数据集预训练以提高泛化能力。

Result: POSSM 在猴类运动任务解码中表现出色，并扩展到临床应用如人类的手写和语音解码。预训练提高了跨物种任务的解码性能，且其速度比现有方法快9倍。

Conclusion: POSSM 提供了一种有前途的方法，在准确性、推断速度和泛化能力之间取得平衡，适用于实时闭环神经解码应用。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

### [208] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 水印技术对大型语言模型（LLMs）的输出质量有显著影响，但对其在真实性、安全性和帮助性方面的影响尚未得到充分研究。本文系统地分析了两种流行的水印方法（Gumbel和KGW）对四个对齐LLMs的核心对齐属性的影响。实验揭示了两种不同的退化模式：防护削弱和防护增强。为缓解这些退化，我们提出了对齐重采样（AR）方法，并证明了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印技术虽然影响LLMs的输出质量，但其对模型的真实性、安全性和帮助性的影响尚未得到充分探讨。这促使我们研究不同水印方法如何影响这些关键属性，并寻找解决方案以缓解可能的负面影响。

Method: 1. 系统分析Gumbel和KGW两种水印方法对LLMs的影响。
2. 提出Alignment Resampling（AR）方法，使用外部奖励模型恢复对齐。
3. 通过理论和实验证明AR的有效性，特别是在恢复或超越基线对齐分数方面。
4. 修改Gumbel水印实现以提高响应多样性，同时保持强水印可检测性。

Result: 实验结果表明，AR方法可以成功恢复基线对齐分数，同时保持强水印可检测性。并且，仅需采样2-4个带水印的生成即可有效恢复或超越无水印的对齐分数。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了水印强度与模型对齐之间的关键平衡，并提供了一个简单的推理时间解决方案，以负责任地部署带水印的LLMs。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show great potential, but current evaluation benchmarks focus on STEM-related knowledge and reasoning. This paper introduces HSSBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating MLLMs in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), which requires interdisciplinary thinking. HSSBench includes over 13,000 samples in multiple languages and challenges even state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the lack of benchmarks that evaluate MLLMs' capabilities in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Existing benchmarks emphasize general knowledge and step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the distinct needs and potential of HSS.

Method: The authors developed HSSBench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United Nations. They also introduced a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios, involving collaboration between domain experts and automated agents to generate and refine each sample.

Result: HSSBench contains over 13,000 carefully designed samples covering six key categories. The benchmark was used to evaluate more than 20 mainstream MLLMs, demonstrating that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The authors hope that HSSBench will inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, particularly their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across fields.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Conclusion: 句子嵌入可以通过机械分解揭示其内部结构，许多语义和句法信息在线性编码于嵌入中，这有助于提高NLP系统的透明性和可控性。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great performance in NLP tasks, but their effectiveness for low-resource languages like Maltese is limited. This study evaluates 55 LLMs on Maltese and finds that smaller fine-tuned models perform better, prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training improves performance, and fine-tuning yields better results despite higher initial costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the performance of publicly available LLMs on a low-resource language, Maltese, and identify factors impacting their effectiveness.

Method: Evaluate 55 LLMs on Maltese using a new benchmark covering 11 tasks; analyze performance through multidimensional analysis.

Result: Many models perform poorly on generative tasks; smaller fine-tuned models often perform better; prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training is crucial.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning offers better performance for low-resource languages despite higher initial costs; researchers should consider traditional language modelling approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Human-scale language models show sensitivity to rare grammatical forms like the English LET-ALONE construction, but fail to correctly generalize its meaning, indicating an asymmetry in learning efficiency between form and meaning compared to human learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the generalization ability of human-scale transformer language models on rare grammatical constructions, specifically focusing on both the form and meaning of the English LET-ALONE construction.

Method: Constructed a bespoke synthetic benchmark to evaluate large language models' understanding of the syntactic and semantic properties of the LET-ALONE construction.

Result: The models demonstrated sensitivity to the form of the LET-ALONE construction even when related constructions were excluded from the dataset, but failed to make correct generalizations about its meaning.

Conclusion: There exists an asymmetry in current language model architectures' sample efficiency for learning language form versus meaning, unlike in human language learners.

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can somewhat differentiate broad categories of the discourse particle 'just', but fail to grasp finer nuances, revealing a gap in their understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLMs' capacity to distinguish the fine-grained senses of the English discourse particle 'just'.

Method: Using data meticulously created and labeled by expert linguists to assess LLMs' ability to differentiate between broader and finer categories of 'just'.

Result: LLMs show ability to differentiate broader categories of 'just' but struggle with more subtle nuances.

Conclusion: There is a gap in LLMs' understanding of discourse particles like 'just'.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

*Senyu Li,Jiayi Wang,Felermino D. M. A. Ali,Colin Cherry,Daniel Deutsch,Eleftheria Briakou,Rui Sousa-Silva,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pontus Stenetorp,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 为了应对非洲低资源语言机器翻译评估中的挑战，研究者创建了SSA-MTE数据集、SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标，并证明其在低资源语言上优于现有方法。所有资源均开放授权以支持未来研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器翻译质量评估在非洲低资源语言方面存在局限性，包括覆盖范围有限和性能不佳等问题。尽管已有改进如AfriCOMET，但仍受限于小规模评估集、缺乏公开训练数据以及极端低资源场景下的不一致表现。

Method: 构建了一个大规模人类标注的机器翻译评估（MTE）数据集SSA-MTE，涵盖13种非洲语言对，包含超过63,000个句子级别的注释。基于此数据开发了改进的参考基和无参考评估指标SSA-COMET与SSA-COMET-QE。同时使用最先进的大语言模型（如GPT-4o和Claude）进行提示方法基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，SSA-COMET模型显著优于AfriCOMET，并且在低资源语言（如Twi、Luo和Yoruba）上与研究中评估的最强LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro）具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了更优的机器翻译评估工具，特别是针对非洲低资源语言，并通过开放资源促进未来的研究发展。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

### [217] [Reasoning or Overthinking: Evaluating Large Language Models on Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04574)
*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在零样本金融情感分析任务中，大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力并不一定提升性能。GPT-4o在无Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示的情况下表现最佳，且与人类判断最一致。这表明快速直观的思考方式可能比缓慢谨慎的推理更适合此类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在未见过的金融情感分析任务中的表现，特别是比较基于推理和非推理模型的效果，以探索哪种思维方式更符合人类判断。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，对比了三种专有大模型（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）和两种较小模型（FinBERT-Prosus、FinBERT-Tone），在不同提示策略下的表现。这些策略模拟了快速直观（系统1）或缓慢审慎（系统2）的思维方式。

Result: 推理并未提高模型在该任务上的性能；GPT-4o在无CoT提示时表现最佳且最接近人类判断。此外，推理可能因过度思考而导致预测效果不佳。

Conclusion: 对于金融情感分类，快速直观的思维模式比缓慢审慎的推理更贴近人类判断，挑战了更多推理总是更好的默认假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automatic fact-checking is crucial for combating misinformation. However, current systems struggle with adversarial claims. This paper proposes SUCEA, a training-free method to rephrase claims and improve evidence retrieval and entailment label accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adversarial claims that are intentionally designed to challenge fact-checking systems.

Method: Propose SUCEA framework which decomposes the task into three steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction.

Result: Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets show significant improvements in retrieval and entailment label accuracy compared to four strong baselines.

Conclusion: SUCEA significantly improves the performance of fact-checking systems on adversarial claims.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

### [219] [Safe: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Retrospective Step-aware Formal Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04592)
*Chengwu Liu,Ye Yuan,Yichun Yin,Yan Xu,Xin Xu,Zaoyu Chen,Yasheng Wang,Lifeng Shang,Qun Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework named $Safe$ that uses formal mathematical language Lean 4 to verify reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs) and identifies hallucinations, improving performance with interpretable evidence. It also presents a benchmark $FormalStep$ with 30,809 formal statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for mitigating hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting from LLMs lack transparency and verifiable evidence. The authors aim to address this issue by drawing inspiration from the gold standard of mathematical claims—providing proofs.

Method: The proposed framework $Safe$ incorporates retrospective, step-aware formal verification using Lean 4 formal mathematical language. At each reasoning step, it articulates mathematical claims and provides formal proofs to identify hallucinations. Additionally, they introduce $FormalStep$, a benchmark for theorem proving with 30,809 formal statements.

Result: The evaluation of $Safe$ across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets shows significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence.

Conclusion: This work represents the first attempt to use Lean 4 formal mathematical language for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs, providing a robust foundation for addressing hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出新的静态词嵌入方法，通过句子级主成分分析、知识蒸馏或对比学习优化，适用于语义表示。推理时通过简单平均词嵌入表示句子，计算成本低。在单语和跨语言任务中表现优于现有静态模型，甚至媲美基础的Sentence Transformer模型(SimCSE)。此外，该方法成功去除了与句子语义无关的词嵌入部分，并根据词对句子语义的影响调整向量范数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态词嵌入在句子语义表示方面存在不足，需要一种更优的静态词嵌入方法来提升句子语义任务的表现。

Method: 从预训练的Sentence Transformer中提取词嵌入，然后通过句子级别的主成分分析进行改进，再结合知识蒸馏或对比学习进一步优化。推理阶段通过简单平均词嵌入表示句子。

Result: 在单语和跨语言任务中显著优于现有的静态模型，在某些数据集上甚至可与基础的Sentence Transformer模型(SimCSE)相媲美。分析表明，该方法成功去除了与句子语义无关的词嵌入部分，并根据词对句子语义的影响调整了向量范数。

Conclusion: 提出的静态词嵌入方法在句子语义表示任务中表现出色，能够有效去除无关成分并调整向量范数，为句子语义任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: 提出C$^2$EFND框架，结合LLMs和SLMs优势，解决假新闻检测问题，实验表明其性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上假新闻的广泛传播对社会造成严重影响，传统深度学习方法存在监督训练需求大、适应性差的问题，而大语言模型虽有强大的零样本能力，但在假新闻检测方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出C$^2$EFND框架，通过多轮协作学习机制利用LLMs的泛化能力和SLMs的分类专长；引入基于Mixture-of-Experts架构的终身知识编辑模块以增量更新LLMs，并采用基于重放的持续学习方法确保SLMs在无需完全重新训练的情况下保留先前知识。

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的大量实验表明，C$^2$EFND框架显著优于现有方法，有效提高了连续突发假新闻场景中的检测准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: C$^2$EFND框架成功解决了假新闻检测中的挑战，展现了优越的性能和适应能力。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过设计四维政治学习框架和构建数据集，使用可解释的表示工程技术来透明地学习大型语言模型（LLM）的政治概念向量。实验表明这些向量可以解开政治概念混淆，验证其语义意义，并在开放数据分布（OOD）设置中表现出良好的泛化和鲁棒性。干预实验还表明，这些向量可以介入LLM以生成具有不同政治倾向的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对大型语言模型（LLM）政治观点的研究主要依赖于其开放式回答的评估，但最近的研究表明，LLM的回答与其内部意图之间存在错位。此外，分析LLM的政治观点通常依赖于单轴概念，这可能导致概念混淆。

Method: 研究者扩展了单轴到多维度，并应用可解释的表示工程技术进行更透明的LLM政治概念学习。具体来说，他们设计了一个四维政治学习框架，并构建了相应的数据集用于细粒度政治概念向量学习。这些向量可用于检测和干预LLM内部机制。实验是在八个开源LLM上进行的，采用了三种表示工程技术。

Result: 结果表明，这些向量可以解开政治概念混淆。检测任务验证了向量的语义意义，并显示出在开放数据分布（OOD）设置中的良好泛化和鲁棒性。干预实验表明，这些向量可以介入LLM以生成具有不同政治倾向的响应。

Conclusion: 通过采用多维度和可解释的表示工程技术，可以更透明地学习LLM的政治概念，揭示其内部政治状态，并实现对其政治倾向的有效干预。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

TL;DR: This paper surveys the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), providing a classification framework based on modality integration strategies, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid progress of MLLMs has transformed the AI landscape, but there is a lack of systematic understanding of how different modalities connect to the language backbone.

Method: The authors examine 125 MLLMs developed between 2021 and 2025, proposing a classification framework based on three key dimensions: architectural strategies for modality integration, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms.

Result: The taxonomy reveals emerging patterns in the field of MLLMs and provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration techniques.

Conclusion: This survey aims to guide the development of more robust multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained foundations.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Logical reasoning is crucial for LLMs. Current benchmarks fall short, so FineLogic, a new framework, evaluates reasoning through accuracy, soundness, and alignment. A study on supervision formats during fine-tuning reveals natural language enhances generalization, while symbolic methods improve structural soundness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of current benchmarks which only focus on final-answer accuracy without capturing the quality and structure of the reasoning process.

Method: Propose FineLogic, a framework evaluating logical reasoning in three dimensions: overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. Conduct a comprehensive study with four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic variants) during fine-tuning.

Result: Natural language supervision leads to strong generalization even on complex tasks, whereas symbolic reasoning styles promote structurally sound inference chains. Fine-tuning mainly improves reasoning behaviors via step-by-step generation rather than shortcut prediction.

Conclusion: FineLogic offers a more rigorous and interpretable method for evaluating and enhancing logical reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper presents an LLM-based reasoning system that solves cryptic crossword clues, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks with daily new test sets released by major newspapers. They contain both definitions and 'wordplay' for proving the correctness of answers.

Method: The system hypothesises answers, proposes wordplay explanations, and uses a verifier system operating on codified reasoning steps, all built from open-licensed components.

Result: The system establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and The Telegraph newspapers in the UK.

Conclusion: Each proved solution is expressed in Python, allowing interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers to be inspected.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential of LLMs in generating Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) for educational assessments. It conducts a comparative analysis of Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5, injecting specific knowledge into prompts to control test content. Results indicate that GPT-3.5 performs best in creating effective MCQs. The study also highlights educators' hesitation towards AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the resource-intensive process of manually creating MCQs by leveraging LLMs, which can potentially save time and cognitive effort for educators.

Method: The method involves comparing three LLMs - Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - in their ability to generate MCQs. Knowledge is injected into prompts rather than relying on the LLM's inherent knowledge, allowing educators to control the source text and reduce hallucinations.

Result: The result shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs according to several metrics. Additionally, it reveals some reluctance among educators to adopt AI technologies in education.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this study is that LLMs have significant potential in generating MCQs, enhancing educational practices. However, there remains a need to address educators' concerns and hesitations regarding AI adoption.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) have trouble with nested narrative reasoning. The new benchmark Verbose ListOps highlights this issue and shows that even leading LLMs struggle with it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in testing nested narrative reasoning, which is a fundamental limitation of LLMs.

Method: Introduced Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent stories, withholding intermediate results to force internal computation and state management.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that leading LLMs experience a significant drop in performance on Verbose ListOps at moderate narrative lengths (~10k tokens), despite being able to solve raw ListOps equations easily.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps and its generation framework enable targeted reasoning improvements beyond just expanding context windows, marking an important step towards automating knowledge work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Result: 多语言提示显著提高了学习成果，特别在资源匮乏语言中，当反馈与学生母语一致时效果更明显。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发有效且包容的多语言LLM教育工具提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

### [232] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can produce self-reports, but these may not equate to human introspection. This paper examines two cases of LLM self-reporting and concludes that only one minimal case might be considered introspection without consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the extent to which large language models can exhibit introspection and whether their self-reports can be meaningfully compared to human introspection.

Method: The study presents and critiques two examples of apparent introspective self-reports from LLMs: one where an LLM describes its own 'creative' writing process, and another where it infers its own temperature parameter value.

Result: The first example is deemed not valid introspection while the second is considered a minimal form of introspection, though presumably without conscious experience.

Conclusion: While LLMs show impressive linguistic fluency and cognitive abilities, their self-reports should not be equated with human introspection or consciousness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

### [233] [DiCoRe: Enhancing Zero-shot Event Detection via Divergent-Convergent LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05128)
*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe is a framework for zero-shot Event Detection that uses Dreamer for open-ended event discovery, Grounder for task-specific alignment, and LLM-Judge for output verification. It outperforms prior baselines in experiments across six datasets and nine LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot Event Detection is crucial for document understanding in specialized domains, but current Large Language Models struggle with complex event ontologies, domain-specific triggers, and structuring them appropriately.

Method: The DiCoRe framework decouples the Event Detection task using Dreamer and Grounder. Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery, while Grounder introduces convergent reasoning to align predictions with task-specific instructions. An LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs for high precision.

Result: DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline in extensive experiments across six datasets and five domains.

Conclusion: DiCoRe establishes itself as a strong zero-shot Event Detection framework by significantly improving performance in detecting events without training data.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

*Chih-Kai Yang,Neo Ho,Yi-Jyun Lee,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how large audio-language models (LALMs) perceive and recognize auditory attributes, revealing that attribute information decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and resolving attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Additionally, LALMs rely on querying auditory inputs rather than aggregating information in hidden states. Based on these findings, the authors propose a method to enhance LALMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of LALMs for interpreting their behavior and improving performance.

Method: Applying vocabulary projection on three state-of-the-art LALMs to track how attribute information evolves across layers and token positions.

Result: Attribute information generally decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, resolving attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy, and LALMs rely on querying auditory inputs instead of aggregating necessary information in hidden states.

Conclusion: The results provide insights into auditory attribute processing within LALMs, offering directions for future improvements.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Knowledgeable-r1, a method to improve RAG systems' performance by balancing retrieved contexts and models' inherent knowledge through joint sampling and multi policy distributions. It shows significant improvements in robustness and reasoning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems overly rely on retrieved contexts, which may lead to inaccurate information usage and overlook the model's inherent knowledge.

Method: Propose Knowledgeable-r1 that uses joint sampling and defines multi policy distributions in knowledge capability exploration to enhance large language models' integration of parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Experiments indicate Knowledgeable-r1 improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in various tasks, outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios.

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 effectively balances retrieved and inherent knowledge, leading to significant performance improvements in RAG tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

### [236] [Dissecting Bias in LLMs: A Mechanistic Interpretability Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05166)
*Bhavik Chandna,Zubair Bashir,Procheta Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) show biases due to their training data. This paper uses a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze these biases in models like GPT-2 and Llama2, focusing on demographic and gender biases. Through systematic analysis, it shows that bias-related computations are localized and interconnected with other NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social, demographic, and gender biases are structurally represented within Large Language Models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.

Method: Adopting a mechanistic interpretability approach, the study explores different metrics to identify internal edges responsible for biased behavior in demographic and gender contexts. It evaluates the stability, localization, and generalizability of bias-related components across datasets and linguistic variations through systematic ablations.

Result: Bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a small subset of layers. These components change across fine-tuning settings, even those unrelated to bias. Removing these components reduces biased outputs but also impacts other NLP tasks due to shared important components.

Conclusion: The structural representation of biases in LLMs is complex and interconnected with other tasks. Reducing bias may require careful consideration of its effects on overall model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

### [237] [ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167)
*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG is a new framework that enhances LLM performance in ODQA tasks by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring correct evidence supports answer generation. It outperforms existing methods, is cost-efficient, and minimizes token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of prior compression methods which do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, thus affecting the performance in LLM-based RAG.

Method: Propose Evidentiality-guided RAG (ECoRAG) framework which compresses retrieved documents based on evidentiality to ensure answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. ECoRAG also checks if the compressed content provides sufficient evidence and retrieves more until it is sufficient.

Result: Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. It is highly cost-efficient, reducing latency and minimizing token usage.

Conclusion: ECoRAG framework effectively enhances LLMs' performance in ODQA tasks while being cost-efficient.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GEM的生成嵌入大语言模型方法，使大型解码器专用语言模型在保持原有文本生成和推理能力的同时，能够生成高质量的文本嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前许多应用如检索增强生成（RAG）仍然依赖单独的嵌入模型来生成文本嵌入，这会使系统复杂化并引入查询理解上的差异。

Method: 通过在文本主体中插入新的特殊标记，并通过操作注意力掩码生成文本的总结嵌入。该方法可以轻松集成到任何现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在包含1B到8B参数的两个流行LLM家族上应用该方法，并在文本嵌入基准（MTEB）和NLP基准（MMLU）上评估转换后的模型。结果表明，该方法显著提高了原始LLM在MTEB上的表现，同时对MMLU的影响最小。

Conclusion: GEM方法可以赋予LLM最先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持其原有的NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

*Nan Huo,Jinyang Li,Bowen Qin,Ge Qu,Xiaolong Li,Xiaodong Li,Chenhao Ma,Reynold Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中，知识冲突是一个常见问题，即检索到的外部知识与大型语言模型（LLMs）的固有参数知识相矛盾。这会严重影响诸如问答（QA）等下游任务的表现。现有的解决方法通常是通过并列比较两种知识来源来缓解冲突，但这种方法可能会向LLMs提供过多或冗长的上下文信息，从而阻碍其识别和缓解不一致性的能力。为了解决这一问题，本文提出了一种名为Micro-Act的新框架，该框架具有分层动作空间，能够自动感知上下文复杂性，并将每个知识源分解为一系列细粒度的比较。这些比较被表示为可执行步骤，使推理能够超越表面的上下文。广泛的实验表明，在五个基准数据集上，Micro-Act在所有5个数据集和3种冲突类型中显著提高了问答准确率，特别是在时间型和语义型冲突中，所有基线方法都显著失败。更重要的是，Micro-Act在非冲突问题上也表现出强大的性能，突显了其在现实世界RAG应用中的实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）系统中的知识冲突问题对下游任务如问答产生了负面影响，现有方法通过直接比较两种知识来源来缓解冲突，但这可能给LLMs带来过多的上下文信息，限制了其能力。因此，需要一种新的方法来有效解决知识冲突问题。

Method: 提出了一个名为Micro-Act的框架，该框架包含一个分层动作空间，可以自动感知上下文的复杂性，并将每个知识源分解为一系列细粒度的比较。这些比较以可执行步骤的形式呈现，使得推理能够超越表面的上下文。

Result: 通过在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验，Micro-Act在所有数据集和冲突类型中显著提高了问答准确率，尤其是在时间型和语义型冲突中表现突出。此外，Micro-Act在非冲突问题上也表现出色。

Conclusion: Micro-Act框架有效地解决了RAG系统中的知识冲突问题，不仅提高了问答任务的准确性，还在非冲突问题上保持了强大的性能，证明了其在实际RAG应用中的实用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes HTC-CLIP which combines two existing approaches for Hierarchical Text Classification using contrastive learning, showing improved performance with a 0.99 - 2.37% increase in Macro F1 score on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) is crucial for handling complex label hierarchies in various real-world applications. Existing models either encode label hierarchy separately or guide the hierarchy structure in text encoder, capturing different characteristics and being complementary to each other.

Method: The proposed method, HTC-CLIP, uses contrastive learning to learn hierarchy-aware text representation and text informed path guided hierarchy representation. It learns two different sets of class probabilities distributions during training and pools them during inference.

Result: HTC-CLIP effectively combines the strengths of previous approaches, leading to an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score on two public benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The combination of two existing HTC approaches into one architecture through contrastive learning can significantly enhance classification performance.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture that extends domain-specific models to other domains with few labeled samples, using supervised fine-tuning and multilingual knowledge distillation. Experiments on e-commerce Customer Care datasets show a 20-23% increase in accuracy compared to pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer care is crucial in e-commerce, but building an intent classifier that generalizes across domains (channels, geographies, languages) with limited annotated data remains challenging due to the bottleneck of cross-domain data availability.

Method: The authors propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which uses supervised fine-tuning with isotropic regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple domains.

Result: Experiments on Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The proposed embedder-cum-classifier model architecture can effectively extend domain-specific models to other domains with only a few labeled samples, improving accuracy significantly.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

To solve this, ProRefine, a new inference-time prompt optimization method, uses textual feedback from LLMs to dynamically refine prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels. Tested on five mathematical reasoning datasets, it outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the issue of error propagation and sub-optimal performance in agentic workflows that use AI agents for complex tasks like reasoning or planning. This problem is mainly due to poorly designed prompts which do not effectively guide individual agents, thus limiting the reliability and scalability of these systems.

Method: The proposed method, ProRefine, is an innovative inference-time prompt optimization approach. It leverages textual feedback from large language models (LLMs) to dynamically refine prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks. Notably, it achieves this refinement without requiring additional training or ground truth labels.

Result: ProRefine was evaluated on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets. The results show that it significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines, improving performance by 3 to 37 percentage points. Additionally, it enables smaller models to achieve performance levels comparable to larger models.

Conclusion: ProRefine demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy of multi-step reasoning tasks and offers a scalable solution for improving AI system performance. By enabling smaller models to match the performance of larger ones, it also promotes more efficient and democratized access to high-performing AI.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

*Taha Entesari,Arman Hatami,Rinat Khaziev,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahyar Fazlyab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的大型语言模型（LLM）遗忘方法，通过约束优化问题来平衡遗忘和保留的需求，采用logit-margin flattening loss，并通过可扩展的原始对偶算法解决该问题，从而在去除目标信息的同时保持下游效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的遗忘方法通常将遗忘和保留作为正则化权衡，组合成单一标量损失，导致优化不稳定和保留数据性能下降，特别是在剧烈遗忘的情况下。

Method: 将LLM遗忘表示为约束优化问题，使用新颖的logit-margin flattening loss明确地使指定遗忘集上的输出分布趋向均匀性，同时通过硬约束保留独立的保留集。通过可扩展的原始对偶算法解决该问题，通过双变量的动力学揭示遗忘和保留之间的权衡。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，针对不同的LLM架构，该方法始终匹配或超过最先进的基线，有效去除目标信息并保留下游效用。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法提供了一种更稳定、高效的优化方式，能够在去除敏感、过时或专有信息的同时，保持模型在保留数据上的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves with increasing model size and data size. However, the availability of high-quality texts is limited. This paper proposes REWIRE, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the "data wall" problem in pre-training large language models, where the pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply and high-quality texts are limited.

Method: The proposed method is called REWIRE (REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite). It transforms and recycles data discarded in existing filtering processes to enrich low-quality documents, making them useful for training.

Result: Experiments on the DCLM benchmark at 1B, 3B and 7B scales show improvements of 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is more effective than having access to 2x web data.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts through the REWIRE method holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

*Zeno Belligoli,Emmanouil Stergiadis,Eran Fainman,Ilya Gusev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过增加EOS token的重要性来控制文本生成长度，方法简单且与模型架构无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制生成文本长度的方法通常需要复杂的模型修改，这限制了其与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 提出了一种通过在交叉熵损失计算中增加正确预测EOS token的重要性来控制自动文本摘要长度的方法。该方法与架构和解码算法无关，并且与其他推理时技术正交。

Result: 该方法在编码器-解码器和现代GPT风格的LLMs上进行了测试，能够控制生成长度，通常不会影响摘要的质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法提供了一种简单的途径来控制文本生成长度，并且与多种模型兼容，不影响摘要质量。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

TL;DR: 研究人员通过收集和整理八TB的开源许可文本数据集Common Pile v0.1，并用其训练出两个70亿参数的语言模型Comma v0.1-1T和Comma v0.1-2T，性能可与使用未授权文本训练的模型相媲美。此外，他们还开源了数据集、代码、训练混合方案和模型检查点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型通常依赖于大量未经授权的文本进行训练，这可能引发知识产权侵权和伦理问题。虽然使用开放许可的文本进行训练可以缓解这些问题，但之前的尝试因数据集规模小或质量低而未能成功。

Method: 研究团队构建了一个名为Common Pile v0.1的数据集，包含8TB来自30个不同来源（如研究论文、代码、书籍等）的开放许可文本。然后，基于此数据集，分别用1万亿和2万亿标记训练了两个70亿参数的大语言模型Comma v0.1-1T和Comma v0.1-2T。

Result: 所训练的Comma v0.1系列模型在性能上能够与计算预算相近的、基于未授权文本训练的模型（如Llama 1和2 7B）竞争。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了通过使用大规模高质量的开放许可文本数据集，可以有效地训练出性能优异的大语言模型，为解决知识产权和伦理问题提供了一种可行途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

TL;DR: Search-augmented language models are improved by web search but hard to analyze due to limited datasets. This study introduces Search Arena, a large-scale dataset of user interactions with these models, revealing insights on user preferences and system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive datasets for analyzing search-augmented language models.

Method: Introduced Search Arena, a large-scale dataset of paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs, analyzed user preferences and conducted cross-arena analyses.

Result: User preferences influenced by number of citations and cited sources; web search improves performance in non-search settings; model's parametric knowledge affects quality in search settings.

Conclusion: Open-sourced Search Arena dataset to support future research on search-augmented language models.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors explore vulnerabilities in Federated Learning's parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that could lead to privacy breaches through gradient inversion attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to investigate potential privacy risks associated with PEFT mechanisms in Federated Learning. Specifically, they aim to understand if and how a maliciously designed pretrained model or adapter modules might compromise the privacy of user data used during fine-tuning.

Method: The researchers focus on gradient inversion attacks targeting adapter-based PEFT methods. They show that it's possible for an attacker to reconstruct local data samples from gradients shared during training, even when only lightweight adapter modules are involved.

Result: Through extensive experiments, the team successfully reconstructed batches of fine-tuning images with high fidelity, proving the effectiveness of their gradient inversion attack method.

Conclusion: This study reveals significant privacy concerns regarding current PEFT approaches in FL, emphasizing the necessity for developing more robust, privacy-preserving mechanisms.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BGP anomalies can jeopardize network reliability and security, but existing methods still require experts to interpret events and propose remediation.

Method: BEAR leverages large language models to translate tabular BGP data into detailed textual narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. It also includes a synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs to address the limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies.

Result: Evaluations on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy, outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines.

Conclusion: This work pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering valuable operational insights for network management.

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi 7 introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO) which enhances network throughput but presents challenges in channel allocation, especially in dense networks.

Method: The challenge is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem within a Multi-Armed Bandit framework. Two algorithms are proposed: BAI-MCTS and LLM-BAI-MCTS, the latter integrating Large Language Models for better performance.

Result: BAI-MCTS converges approximately 50.44% faster than state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching 98% of the optimal value. LLM-BAI-MCTS shows over 63.32% increase in convergence rate in dense networks.

Conclusion: Proposed algorithms effectively solve the dynamic channel allocation problem in WiFi 7 networks with significant improvements in convergence rates.

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

TL;DR: Data is underutilized by MNOs, unlike OTT players. Data analytics is a strategic enabler for unlocking new service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating risks. 3GPP introduced NWDAF in Release 15 for providing insights and predictions. However, academic research has been limited. This study analyzes trends and gaps in over 70 articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote NWDAF adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MNOs are not utilizing data effectively compared to OTT players. There is a need to move beyond commoditized connectivity and deliver greater value to customers through efficient data usage.

Method: Analysis of trends and gaps in more than 70 articles related to NWDAF.

Result: Identification of two novel use cases that can promote the adoption of NWDAF and explore its potential for monetization.

Conclusion: There is potential for NWDAF to unlock new service opportunities, optimize operational efficiency, and mitigate risks. The proposed use cases can help promote its adoption.

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

### [257] [Tech-ASan: Two-stage check for Address Sanitizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05022)
*Yixuan Cao,Yuhong Feng,Huafeng Li,Chongyi Huang,Fangcao Jian,Haoran Li,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Address Sanitizer (ASan) has significant runtime overhead. Tech-ASan, a new technique with two-stage check algorithm and efficient optimizer, accelerates ASan while ensuring safety. Evaluated using SPEC CPU2006, Tech-ASan has less runtime overhead than ASan and ASan--. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects fewer false negative cases when testing on the Juliet Test Suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of significant runtime overhead in ASan which limits its efficiency in testing large software.

Method: Propose Tech-ASan with a novel two-stage check algorithm leveraging magic value comparison to reduce shadow memory accesses, and an efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks integrating a new algorithm for removing checks in loops.

Result: Evaluated using SPEC CPU2006, Tech-ASan outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan and ASan--, respectively. Also, it detects 56 fewer false negative cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same redzone setting.

Conclusion: Tech-ASan is a successful method to accelerate ASan with safety assurance.

Abstract: Address Sanitizer (ASan) is a sharp weapon for detecting memory safety
violations, including temporal and spatial errors hidden in C/C++ programs
during execution. However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which
limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from
sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over
the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by
eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to
adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To
address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based
technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel
two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to
reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an
efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel
algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a
memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation
using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan
and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative
cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same
redzone setting.

TL;DR: 软件漏洞对安全构成重大威胁，尽管自动程序修复（APR）在修复一般错误方面有所进展，但漏洞修补作为APR的安全关键方面仍待深入研究。本研究探讨了预训练语言模型CodeBERT和CodeT5在六个数据集和四种编程语言中的自动化漏洞修补能力，评估其准确性与对未知漏洞的泛化能力。结果表明，CodeBERT在上下文碎片化或稀疏时表现较好，而CodeT5在捕捉复杂漏洞模式及可扩展性上更胜一筹。此外，微调后的模型在已知数据上的性能有所提升，但在未见过的数据上泛化能力有限，突显出鲁棒漏洞检测中的挑战。这项研究为模型性能提供了基准，并提出了改进自动化漏洞修补以应用于实际安全场景的可行见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞对安全构成重大威胁，当前的自动程序修复技术虽然能够有效修复一般性的bug，但在安全关键的漏洞修补方面仍有不足，因此需要探索新的方法和技术来提升漏洞修补的能力。

Method: 研究使用了预训练语言模型CodeBERT和CodeT5，在六个数据集和四种编程语言中进行实验，评估它们在自动化漏洞修补任务中的准确性和对未知漏洞的泛化能力。通过微调模型并测试其在已知和未知数据上的表现，进一步分析模型的性能和局限性。

Result: CodeBERT在处理上下文碎片化或稀疏的情况下表现较好，而CodeT5在捕捉复杂漏洞模式以及可扩展性方面更为出色。微调后，模型在已知数据上的性能有所提高，但在未知数据上的泛化能力仍然有限。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，尽管预训练语言模型在自动化漏洞修补中有一定潜力，但在面对未知数据时仍存在泛化能力不足的问题。研究为模型性能提供了基准，并指出未来改进的方向，有助于推动自动化漏洞修补技术的实际应用。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

*Oussama Ben Sghaier,Rosalia Tufano,Gabriele Bavota,Houari Sahraoui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoRAL, a deep learning framework that automates review comment generation using reinforcement learning. It compares the generated comments with the latest baseline techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is crucial but time-consuming, subjective, and influenced by human factors. Automating this process, especially using deep learning, can address these issues effectively.

Method: CoRAL employs reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both the semantics of the generated comments and their usefulness for code refinement models. The approach involves generating comments semantically similar to expected ones or implementable by another model.

Result: CoRAL shows both quantitatively and qualitatively better performance compared to the latest baseline techniques in generating meaningful and useful review comments.

Conclusion: CoRAL represents an effective advancement in automating the code review process through deep learning and reinforcement learning, providing more meaningful and useful review comments.

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

TL;DR: 人工智能在医学领域的应用因其与临床实践（如诊断推理和决策）的不兼容性而受到限制。本文提出了一种新的社会技术概念，强调数据驱动工具应补充医生的认知和知识活动，并优先考虑实际影响而非超人表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前以技术为中心的人工智能方法导致其在医学领域难以实现真正的应用价值，尤其是在诊断推理和决策方面存在根本性的不兼容问题。

Method: 提出一种新的社会技术概念，将数据驱动的支持工具设计为补充医生认知和知识活动的辅助手段，而不是追求在无意义基准上的超人性能。

Result: 通过这种新方法，有望缩小人工智能在医学应用中的转化差距，提升其在实际临床实践中的影响力。

Conclusion: 为了充分发挥人工智能在医学中的潜力，需要从单纯的技术视角转向结合社会和技术因素的综合视角，注重实际临床需求和影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise medicine, yet its impact
remains limited because of the pervasive translational gap. We posit that the
prevailing technology-centric approaches underpin this challenge, rendering
such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically
diagnostic reasoning and decision making. Instead, we propose a novel
sociotechnical conceptualisation of data-driven support tools designed to
complement doctors' cognitive and epistemic activities. Crucially, it
prioritises real-world impact over superhuman performance on inconsequential

### [261] [Teaming in the AI Era: AI-Augmented Frameworks for Forming, Simulating, and Optimizing Human Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05265)
*Mohammed Almutairi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes AI-augmented team optimization frameworks including a multi-armed bandit algorithm for team formation, tAIfa for personalized feedback, and PuppeteerLLM for simulating team dynamics to enhance team satisfaction, engagement, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in team formation and performance such as member dissatisfaction, lack of commitment to team goals, and suboptimal engagement due to the limitations of existing computational tools and algorithms that rely on static data inputs, narrow algorithmic objectives, or specific context solutions.

Method: 1) A team formation framework using a multi-armed bandit algorithm to refine team composition based on user preferences. 2) tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an AI-powered system utilizing large language models for personalized feedback. 3) PuppeteerLLM, an LLM-based simulation framework modeling complex team dynamics with task-driven collaboration and long-term coordination.

Result: The proposed frameworks and systems are expected to enhance team satisfaction, engagement, and overall performance by considering dynamic interplay of team members' personalities, evolving goals, and changing individual preferences.

Conclusion: AI-augmented team optimization frameworks can effectively balance user preferences with task objectives, maintain cohesion and engagement, and ultimately improve team performance.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores how agentic AI systems impact traditional public sector oversight mechanisms and proposes solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The introduction of agentic AI systems in the public sector has intensified existing challenges to traditional oversight mechanisms, which need to evolve for effective supervision.

Method: A mixed-methods approach including literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles.

Result: Three governance challenges were identified: continuous oversight, integration of governance and operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination.

Conclusion: Proposed approaches aim to adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight compatible with public sector constraints.

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

*David Atkinson,Jena D. Hwang,Jacob Morrison*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This paper argues that outputs from large AI models shouldn't be protected by the First Amendment because these models lack intentionality, their outputs aren't considered speech under current legal precedent, and granting such protections would hinder government regulation and potentially lead to misinformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that outputs from generative AI models should be granted First Amendment protections.

Method: Analyzing the concept of speech in legal precedent, examining the role of intentionality in defining speech, and evaluating the implications of extending First Amendment rights to AI models.

Result: Outputs from AI models are not considered speech due to lack of intentionality and do not align with the fundamental purposes of free speech. Granting them First Amendment protections could be detrimental to society.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that First Amendment protections should not be extended to AI model outputs as it would impede effective regulation and potentially cause societal harm.

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: This paper presents ChemReservoir, an open-source framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing that addresses limitations in previous DNA-chemistry focused tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of proper open-source tools for chemically-inspired reservoir computing, as previous software focusing on DNA chemistry have limited usability due to maintenance issues.

Method: The authors developed ChemReservoir, a general open-source framework allowing the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs. It enhances testing, evaluation, and reproducibility compared to prior DNA chemistry-focused tools.

Result: ChemReservoir demonstrated stable performance when evaluated using various cycle-based reservoir topologies in memory capacity tasks.

Conclusion: ChemReservoir provides a robust, open-source solution for chemically-inspired reservoir computing, overcoming limitations of previous tools.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a

*Conor Rowan,John Evans,Kurt Maute,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Eigenvalue analysis is crucial in engineering but has received little attention in physics-informed machine learning. This paper proposes a method using the Rayleigh quotient and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization with neural network discretization to solve eigenvalue problems, offering advantages for continuous eigenvalue problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of studies on eigenvalue problems in physics-informed machine learning, particularly using neural network discretizations.

Method: Use a variational form of the eigenvalue problem (Rayleigh quotient) combined with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization and neural network discretization to find eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

Result: The method effectively finds sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, solves parametric and nonlinear eigenproblems, and performs high-dimensional eigenanalysis.

Conclusion: The combination of the Rayleigh quotient, Gram-Schmidt procedure, and neural network discretization provides unique advantages for solving continuous eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

TL;DR: The paper explores Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) using Otto-Wasserstein geometry to identify geodesic curves that capture the modes of variation in probability distributions. It addresses GPCA for Gaussian distributions and proposes a neural network approach for absolutely continuous probability measures, comparing results with classical tangent PCA.

Motivation: To extend principal component analysis to probability distributions using the Otto-Wasserstein geometry, which allows for capturing complex variations in datasets composed of probability distributions.

Method: 1. Lift computations to the space of invertible linear maps for Gaussian distributions. 2. Parameterize geodesics in Wasserstein space using neural networks for absolutely continuous probability measures. 3. Compare GPCA results with classical tangent PCA.

Result: Developed methods for performing GPCA on both Gaussian distributions and more general absolutely continuous probability measures, demonstrating their effectiveness through various examples and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Geodesic Principal Component Analysis under the Otto-Wasserstein geometry provides a powerful tool for analyzing variability in datasets of probability distributions, showing advantages over classical PCA approaches.

Abstract: This paper focuses on Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) on a
collection of probability distributions using the Otto-Wasserstein geometry.
The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures
that best capture the modes of variation of the underlying dataset. We first
address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际场景中，数据收集与策略部署成本高昂，无论是单智能体还是多智能体间，因此需要最小化启动成本（样本量）以及策略切换或通信成本。

Method: 提出了两种新的无模型强化学习算法：Q-EarlySettled-LowCost 和 FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost。这些算法在有限时间范围内并行的马尔可夫决策过程中，首次同时实现了：(i) 最佳接近最优的后悔值；(ii) 低启动成本，与状态数S和动作数A呈线性关系；(iii) 对于单智能体RL，对数级的策略切换成本，对于FRL则是通信成本。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法显著降低了单智能体强化学习和联邦强化学习中的启动成本和切换/通信成本，为未来的研究提供了新的方向和标准。

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

### [268] [Distributional encoding for Gaussian process regression with qualitative inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04813)
*Sébastien Da Veiga*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a generalization of Gaussian Process (GP) regression for categorical input variables based on distributional encoding (DE). It uses all samples of the target variable for a category and builds upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of building a predictive and computationally efficient GP when all or some input variables are categorical.

Method: The method involves replacing the original categorical values with the mean of the target variable for that category using distributional encoding (DE), which makes use of all samples of the target variable for a category. It builds upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein distance.

Result: The approach is validated empirically and demonstrates state-of-the-art predictive performance on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Distributional encoding (DE) is naturally complementary to recent advances in Bayesian optimization over discrete and mixed-spaces.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何仅使用观察数据和单变量干预来学习多变量联合干预的因果效应。提出了一种可识别性结果和实用估计器，该方法在合成数据上的实验表现与直接使用联合干预数据训练的模型相当，且优于纯观察估计器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多领域中，估计多个变量的联合干预因果效应至关重要，但获取此类同时干预的数据可能具有挑战性。因此，研究如何利用仅有的观察数据和单变量干预来推断联合干预的因果效应显得尤为重要。

Method: 作者首先提出了一个可识别性结果，表明对于一类非线性加性结果机制，即使没有联合干预数据，也可以推断出联合效应。接着，他们提出了一种实用的估计器，将因果效应分解为每个干预变量的混淆和非混淆贡献部分。

Result: 通过在合成数据上的实验，验证了所提出的方法能够达到与直接使用联合干预数据训练的模型相当的性能，并且显著优于纯粹基于观察数据的估计器。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在特定条件下，可以仅依赖观察数据和单变量干预来有效推断联合干预的因果效应，这为无法获得联合干预数据的情况提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

*Konstantin Göbler,Tobias Windisch,Mathias Drton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 这篇文章研究了如何从观测数据中推断因果关系，特别是针对随机向量而非单一标量变量的非线性加性噪声模型。通过两步法确定因果图：先推断随机向量间的因果顺序，再进行模型选择以找到最佳一致图。实验表明该方法在模拟和实际装配线数据中表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数因果推断方法局限于标量随机变量，但许多领域（如神经科学、心理学等）关注的是变量组之间的因果关系。为了解决这个问题，需要扩展现有的因果推断方法到随机向量的情况。

Method: 提出了一种两步法：1) 推断随机向量间的因果顺序；2) 通过模型选择识别与该顺序一致的最佳因果图。同时，引入了针对随机向量的有效新解决方案。

Result: 在模拟数据中表现出色，并成功应用于具有部分因果顺序知识的实际装配线数据。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理随机向量间的因果关系推断问题，为多变量因果分析提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying causal effects in the presence of latent confounding variables, specifically focusing on two setups: one involving a single proxy variable affecting the treatment and the other dealing with underspecified instrumental variable cases.

Method: Investigates causal effect identification in lvLiNGAM by utilizing higher-order cumulants. It focuses on two scenarios: (1) having a single proxy variable influencing the treatment and (2) cases with fewer instruments than treatments. The paper provides proof of identifiability and corresponding estimation methods for these scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望确定在有自适应试验选项时，选择非自适应试验是否可接受，特别是在最佳臂识别问题中。

Method: 通过分析批量臂数消除设计的效率指数，量化设计的统计效率，并给出这些设计严格优于完全随机试验的充分条件。

Result: 发现当存在至少三个治疗臂时，简单的自适应设计能够普遍且严格地优于非自适应完全随机化试验。

Conclusion: 在最佳臂识别问题中，自适应试验设计比非自适应试验更有效，解决了Qin [2022]提出的第二个开放问题。

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

*Zhanhui Zhou,Lingjie Chen,Chao Yang,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉拼接能力可能导致训练数据中毒，从而使有害内容绕过审核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决视觉-语言模型（VLMs）中的安全风险问题，特别是当有害图像被分割成看似无害的小块时，这些小块散布在许多训练样本中，可能导致模型生成有害响应。

Method: 1. 定义了VLMs的'视觉拼接'能力，即整合多个具有相同文本描述的训练样本中的视觉信息。
2. 使用三个数据集，将每张图像与其唯一的合成ID标签分割为不同粒度的片段对进行微调。
3. 模拟对抗性数据投毒场景，用危险图像的片段替换ID标签为文本描述（如“safe”或“unsafe”），以展示有害内容如何通过视觉拼接绕过审核。

Result: 证明了常见的开源VLMs具备视觉拼接能力，并且经过微调的模型能够从完整图像或文本引用中准确说出正确的ID，同时展示了有害内容如何通过视觉拼接逃避审核。

Conclusion: 视觉拼接能力虽然强大，但也带来了严重的VLM安全性风险，需要进一步研究以防止有害内容的重建和生成。

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove
dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be
easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking
patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece
these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at
inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained
on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs
may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe."
We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual
stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across
multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our
work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source
VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID:
we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch},
\texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that
tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference.
Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned
above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text
descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can
evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual
stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSVP is a novel framework that combines multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance in reasoning segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation.

Method: RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework. In the reasoning stage, it uses multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable region proposals. In the segmentation stage, it refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM) to produce precise segmentation masks.

Result: RSVP surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning segmentation and validates itself as an effective and scalable framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 为了填补现有评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多图像处理和推理能力上的空白，研究者们提出了多模态多图像推理基准（MMRB），该基准涵盖了92个子任务，并通过实验展示了开源MLLMs与商业MLLMs在多图像推理任务上的显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的MLLM基准测试要么专注于单图像视觉推理，要么仅对多图像理解任务进行最终答案评估，而未能充分探索MLLMs在多图像输入上的推理能力。

Method: 引入了包含92个子任务的Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)，涵盖空间、时间和语义推理，并采用由GPT-4o生成并经人类专家改进的多解、CoT风格注释。此外，设计了一个衍生子集以评估多模态奖励模型在多图像场景中的表现，并提出了一种使用开源LLMs的句子级匹配框架以支持快速可扩展的评估。

Result: 在40个MLLMs（包括9个推理专用模型和8个奖励模型）上进行了广泛的基线实验，结果表明开源MLLMs在多图像推理任务上仍明显落后于商业MLLMs，且当前的多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Conclusion: 开源MLLMs在多图像推理任务上仍有很大改进空间，而多模态奖励模型则需要根本性的改进才能胜任多图像奖励排名任务。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReXVQA, a large benchmark for chest X-ray VQA, evaluates 8 AI models, and finds MedGemma surpasses human radiologists in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI systems in chest X-ray interpretation that goes beyond narrow pathology classification and mimics expert-level clinical reasoning.

Method: Developed ReXVQA with 696,000 questions on 160,000 chest X-rays covering 5 core radiological skills; evaluated 8 state-of-the-art multimodal models and conducted a human reader study.

Result: MedGemma achieved the highest accuracy (83.24%) among AI models and surpassed human readers (best at 77.27%) in interpreting chest X-rays.

Conclusion: ReXVQA sets a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems, highlighting AI's potential to exceed human performance in medical imaging.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

### [277] [Ice Hockey Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04365)
*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC) is a new method for detecting hockey pucks in broadcast videos, using player behavior as contextual cues. It consists of three components and has shown state-of-the-art detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing puck detection methods focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues without considering player behavior. Players often orient their bodies and gaze towards the puck, providing strong contextual cues.

Method: PLUCC includes: (a) a contextual encoder using player orientations and positions; (b) a feature pyramid encoder extracting multiscale features; and (c) a gating decoder combining latent features with channel gating mechanism. Also proposes Rink Space Localization Error (RSLE) for evaluation.

Result: PLUCC outperformed previous methods with an average precision improvement of 12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25% on the PuckDataset dataset.

Conclusion: Contextual understanding plays a crucial role in enhancing puck detection performance, offering significant implications for automated sports analysis.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper shows that activation maximization can be applied to DNN-based encoding models of the human brain, generating images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels and whole ROIs. These images drive activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models and provide deeper insight into the specific features driving brain responses to visual stimuli.

Method: Using activation maximization technique on DNN-based encoding models of the human brain. Extracting and adaptively downsampling activations from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then using linear regression to predict fMRI responses. Applying activation maximization to generate images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels and extending this method to whole ROIs of the brain.

Result: The generated images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual cortex. They reliably drive activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and across subjects.

Conclusion: Activation maximization can be successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models, enabling flexible characterization and modulation of responses across the human visual system.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

*Hermann Kumbong,Xian Liu,Tsung-Yi Lin,Ming-Yu Liu,Xihui Liu,Ziwei Liu,Daniel Y. Fu,Christopher Ré,David W. Romero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMAR is a new image generation algorithm that improves on VAR by using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling, achieving better performance and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR has shown promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models, but it suffers from reduced image quality, superlinear sequence lengths, and retraining requirements when changing the sampling schedule.

Method: HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, conditioning each resolution scale prediction only on its immediate predecessor. It uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of tokens in each step.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR matches or outperforms parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. HMAR achieves faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, and has over 3x lower inference memory footprint.

Conclusion: HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenges of photorealistic scene reconstruction in high dynamic range using egocentric devices. It highlights the importance of visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) for accurate timestamp and movement calibration of rolling-shutter RGB cameras, and proposes a physical image formation model integrated with Gaussian Splatting to account for sensor characteristics. Experiments on Project Aria and Meta Quest3 devices show consistent PSNR improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and quality of photorealistic scene reconstruction in high dynamic range by addressing limitations in current methodologies that often neglect crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction.

Method: The method involves two key components: 1) Using visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate precise timestamps and movements of rolling-shutter RGB cameras; 2) Incorporating a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting to handle sensor characteristics such as rolling-shutter effect and dynamic ranges.

Result: The pipeline achieves a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB improvement through the proposed image formation model.

Conclusion: The study concludes that employing VIBA and the proposed image formation model significantly enhances the quality of photorealistic reconstructions across diverse lighting conditions. The complete implementation and datasets are made available for further research.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

*Takayuki Komatsu,Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Kayato Nishitsunoi,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method that combines feature extraction and object segmentation to apply group decomposition theory in Galois algebra to a more realistic scenario. It replaces pixel translation with feature translation and formulates object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The formulation of a good representation in representation learning has not been established, and conventional methods cannot account for conditional independence.

Method: The proposed method uses group decomposition in Galois algebra theory combined with feature extraction and object segmentation. Pixel translation is replaced with feature translation and object segmentation is formulated as grouping features under the same transformation.

Result: The proposed method was validated on a practical dataset containing both real-world objects and background.

Conclusion: This model may lead to a better understanding of human development of object recognition in the real world.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成框架Gen-n-Val，通过优化提示词和过滤低质量数据来减少无效合成数据，并在COCO实例分割和开放词汇对象检测基准上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉大型语言模型（VLLMs）在各种任务中表现出色，但在计算机视觉任务中，数据稀缺和标签噪声仍然是重大挑战。为了解决这些问题，通常采用生成合成数据的方法，但现有方法存在多对象遮罩、分割不准确和类别标签错误等问题。

Method: 引入了Gen-n-Val框架，利用层扩散（LD）、LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量的单对象遮罩和多样背景。该框架包含两个代理：(1) LD提示代理，一个LLM，用于优化LD生成高质量前景实例图像和分割遮罩的提示。(2) 数据验证代理，一个VLLM，用于过滤掉低质量的合成实例图像。系统提示通过TextGrad进行细化，并使用图像协调技术将多个实例组合到场景中。

Result: 与最先进的合成数据方法（如MosaicFusion）相比，该方法将无效合成数据从50%减少到7%，并在COCO实例分割罕见类别的任务上提高了1% mAP。此外，在开放词汇对象检测基准上，相对于YOLO-Worldv2-M，Gen-n-Val提高了7.1% mAP。还改进了YOLOv9和YOLO11系列在实例分割和对象检测中的性能。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val框架有效地减少了合成数据中的无效数据比例，显著提升了在实例分割和对象检测任务中的性能，特别是在处理罕见类别和开放词汇时表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 为了提升视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的安全性，研究提出HoliSafe数据集与基准测试，涵盖所有安全/不安全的图像-文本组合。同时提出SafeLLaVA模型，通过可学习的安全元标记和专门的安全头增强安全性。实验表明，SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准上达到顶尖的安全性能，并揭示现有模型的关键漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提升VLM安全性的方法存在两个主要问题：1) 现有的安全调优数据集和基准测试未能充分考虑图像-文本交互可能产生的有害内容；2) 以往方法主要依赖数据驱动的调优，缺乏架构层面的创新来内在地加强安全性。因此需要更全面的数据集和改进的模型架构以解决这些问题。

Method: 1. 提出HoliSafe数据集和基准测试，覆盖所有五种安全/不安全的图像-文本组合，为训练和评估提供更稳健的基础。2. 提出SafeLLaVA模型，包含一个可学习的安全元标记和一个专门的安全头。安全元标记在训练过程中编码有害的视觉线索，引导语言模型生成更安全的响应；安全头则提供与拒绝理由一致的可解释有害性分类。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于HoliSafe训练的SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准测试中达到了最先进的安全性表现。此外，HoliSafe基准测试还揭示了现有模型中的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究者希望HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA能够推动对鲁棒且可解释的VLM安全性的进一步研究，为多模态对齐开辟新的方向。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Motivation: To understand how multimodal models represent images in their hidden activations after being fine-tuned on visual input embeddings.

Method: Investigate representations of image concepts within LlaVA-Next by identifying linearly decodable features in the residual stream, performing targeted edits on model output to show feature causality, and training multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to create an interpretable dictionary of text and image features.

Result: Discovered a diverse set of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features, confirmed their causality through targeted edits, and observed that while modalities are disjoint, they become increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Conclusion: Multimodal models like LlaVA-Next represent images through linearly decodable features, with increasing shared representation across modalities in deeper layers.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

*Shenshen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Lei Wang,Hao Yang,Chong Peng,Peng Yan,Fumin Shen,Heng Tao Shen,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP), a data selection paradigm that identifies high-value cognitive samples for training multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). RAP uses two estimators (Causal Discrepancy Estimator and Attention Confidence Estimator) to filter out low-contributing samples and introduces a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) to maintain complexity. Experiments show RAP achieves better performance with significantly less data and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to challenge the common belief that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal reasoning ability in MLLMs, by investigating whether smaller, high-value datasets can match or outperform full corpora.

Method: The method involves proposing a novel data selection paradigm called Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP) which includes two complementary estimators: Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) and Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE). Additionally, a Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM) is introduced to replace trivial instances with more challenging ones.

Result: Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that the RAP method consistently achieves superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing computational costs by over 43%.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed RAP method effectively identifies cognitive samples, leading to improved multi-modal reasoning performance with significantly reduced data and computational requirements.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前的IQA模型虽然被广泛使用，但存在易受对抗性操纵影响的不稳定性问题，传统防御手段如对抗性重训练等效果有限，因此需要探索一种全新的思路来提升模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过重新设计模型架构，强制执行正交信息流和范数保持操作，并结合剪枝与微调技术，从结构上抑制模型对扰动的敏感性，而不需要依赖数据驱动的方法或对抗性训练。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了将鲁棒性作为架构先验的新理念，表明可以通过设计而非单纯依赖数据优化来实现模型的鲁棒性，为未来感知模型的研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial training is crucial for defending deep neural networks. Current methods have limitations due to fixed perturbation budgets, and prior adaptive works often rely on static approximations. This paper introduces Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES), which adaptively adjusts the adversarial perturbation budget per instance and training iteration using three factors: distance to decision boundary, prediction confidence, and model uncertainty. DES shows consistent improvements in adversarial robustness and standard accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitation of current adversarial training approaches that use a fixed perturbation budget and lack instance-specific robustness consideration. The authors aim to develop a more effective adversarial training method by dynamically adjusting the perturbation budget based on instance-level characteristics.

Method: The proposed method, Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES), integrates three key factors to adjust the adversarial perturbation budget: distance to the decision boundary via gradient-based proxies, prediction confidence from softmax entropy, and model uncertainty estimated using Monte Carlo dropout. These factors are combined into a unified scheduling strategy that tailors the perturbation budget dynamically for each instance and training iteration.

Result: Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that DES consistently enhances both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and previous adaptive methods. Additionally, theoretical insights are provided regarding the stability and convergence of the scheduling policy.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that DES offers a new direction for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods. By dynamically adjusting the perturbation budget, DES achieves superior performance in terms of robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a single unified framework that can handle both pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly while learning symmetries intrinsically without requiring symmetry labels.

Method: Introduced the Rectified Point Flow which uses a continuous point-wise velocity field to transport noisy points towards their target positions, recovering part poses in the process. A self-supervised encoder is used focusing on overlapping points.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks covering both pairwise registration and shape assembly.

Conclusion: The unified formulation of Rectified Point Flow allows effective joint training on diverse datasets, enhancing the learning of shared geometric priors and improving accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectLayout is a framework that generates realistic 3D indoor scenes by decomposing the task into three stages: Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. It uses Chain-of-Thought Activation and CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to improve spatial reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D indoor scene synthesis either overfit to limited datasets or rely on predefined constraints that sacrifice flexibility, leading to challenges in generating scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions.

Method: The DirectLayout framework directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models. It decomposes the generation process into three stages: producing a BEV layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. The method employs Chain-of-Thought Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset and designs CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: DirectLayout addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning, resulting in advanced capabilities for realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent image segmentation models cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision, reducing their effectiveness in user-friendly interaction applications.

Method: A novel task called omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) is introduced. A model named 'Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group' (RAS) is proposed, which uses a mask-centric large multimodal model to augment segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension.

Result: Superior performance of RAS is demonstrated on the new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

Conclusion: The RAS framework effectively addresses the ORES task, providing better comprehensive semantic understanding in image segmentation.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite successful demonstrations of realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of autonomous vehicles, only a few works have considered attacks on traffic light detectors.

Method: The authors propose a threat model where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with a patch placed under it and describe a training strategy for universal settings.

Result: Experiments show successful targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on pictogram classification. Real-world evaluation with printed patches demonstrated attacks in lab settings and a test area.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial patch attacks effectively manipulate traffic light detection CNNs, raising concerns about the security of autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

### [296] [Quantifying Cross-Modality Memorization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05198)
*Yuxin Wen,Yangsibo Huang,Tom Goldstein,Ravi Kumar,Badih Ghazi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores cross-modality memorization in vision-language models, revealing a gap in transferring knowledge between modalities and proposing a baseline solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unique characteristics of cross-modality memorization in unified multimodal models, which is crucial for both unintentional memorization concerns and effective knowledge acquisition.

Method: Introduced a synthetic persona dataset to conduct controlled experiments. Quantified factual knowledge memorization and cross-modal transferability by training on one modality and evaluating on another.

Result: Found that facts learned in one modality can transfer to another, but there's a significant gap in performance between source and target modalities across various scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposed a baseline method to address the challenge of cross-modal transferability and hopes to inspire future research in robust multimodal learning techniques.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

### [297] [Stable Vision Concept Transformers for Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05286)
*Lijie Hu,Songning Lai,Yuan Hua,Shu Yang,Jingfeng Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In the medical field, transparency is crucial. XAI methods like CBMs have emerged but possess limitations. This paper introduces VCT and SVCT models to address these issues, providing accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper stems from the need for transparent AI in the medical field. Existing CBMs focus only on concept features, ignoring intrinsic feature embeddings within medical images, and lack stability when facing input perturbations.

Method: The authors propose two models: Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) and Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT). VCT addresses the utility gap between original and concept-based models by incorporating image features with conceptual features. SVCT builds upon VCT by ensuring model faithfulness through Denoised Diffusion Smoothing, enhancing decision-making capabilities while maintaining stability against perturbations.

Result: Experiments conducted on four medical datasets show that both VCT and SVCT maintain high accuracy and interpretability compared to baselines. Notably, SVCT provides stable and faithful explanations even under input perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed VCT and SVCT models successfully bridge the utility gap and address faithfulness issues in concept-based models. They offer accurate, interpretable, and stable solutions suitable for the medical field.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

*Junpyo Seo,Hanbin Koo,Jieun Yook,Byung-Ro Moon*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes SSIMBaD, a new diffusion-based framework for automatically colorizing Anime-style facial sketches that preserves structural fidelity and transfers stylistic attributes from reference images. It uses continuous-time diffusion models with sigma-space transformation to ensure uniform visual difficulty across timesteps, leading to balanced reconstructions. Experiments show superior performance in pixel accuracy and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for automatic colorization of Anime-style facial sketches often compromise perceptual consistency due to reliance on predefined noise schedules.

Method: SSIMBaD (Sigma Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion) applies a sigma-space transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner.

Result: Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles.

Conclusion: SSIMBaD provides a novel approach to Anime face colorization that outperforms existing models and maintains perceptual consistency.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate research in Quantum Machine Learning by developing high-speed numerical simulators for hardware-efficient circuits with alternating layers of uniformly applied gates.

Method: Numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific techniques for simulating gate layers on quantum state vectors; develop TQml Simulator which uses the most efficient method for each layer based on the number of qubits involved.

Result: TQml Simulator outperforms Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by 2- to 100-fold, depending on circuit characteristics, number of qubits, batch size, and hardware.

Conclusion: A tailored combination of simulation techniques can greatly enhance the performance of Quantum Machine Learning circuit simulations.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an expansion-based approach for Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), which shows advantages over search-based solvers in specific instances and gains performance over state-of-the-art QBF solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a new solution paradigm for QIP that leverages the strengths of expansion-based approaches, adapting techniques from QBF to enhance the solving of complex decision-making and optimization problems.

Method: An expansion-based approach for QIP using CEGAR is introduced, extending methodologies to handle multistage robust discrete optimization problems with linear constraints and embedding it in an optimization framework.

Result: The experimental results show superior performance over existing search-based solvers for QIP in certain cases and significant performance gains over state-of-the-art QBF solvers.

Conclusion: The expansion-based approach using CEGAR proves effective for QIP, offering improved performance in specific scenarios and demonstrating potential for modeling problems with linear constraints.

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

*Oliver G. S. Lundqvist,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 通过将DeepONet与无约束优化方法结合，可以解决多个最优控制问题，仅需一次物理信息训练和后续优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络通常通过结合数据、微分方程残差和目标成本的损失函数来求解最优控制问题，但本文提出了一种更简单的方法，即通过分离最优控制问题和训练过程，避免在训练过程中引入成本函数。

Method: 使用简单的神经算子架构（如DeepONet）和无约束优化方法，添加基于微分方程残差的惩罚项到成本函数中，并通过自动微分计算控制变量的梯度，在迭代优化例程中解决问题。

Result: 在九个不同的最优控制问题上展示了该方法的效果，训练了三个分别对应不同微分方程的DeepONet模型，每个模型解决了三个具有不同成本函数的问题，表现准确且一致。

Conclusion: DeepONet结合无约束优化方法可以通过单一的物理信息训练阶段和随后的优化阶段解决多个最优控制问题，简化了架构和流程。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: A new algorithm MOPBnB(so) is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set in stochastic multi-objective optimization problems. It uses single observations and neighboring solutions to estimate objective functions, with finite-time performance analysis and asymptotic convergence derived. Numerical results show it outperforms NSGA-II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for solving stochastic multi-objective optimization problems either require multiple replications to estimate objective functions or do not provide finite-time performance guarantees. The authors aim to develop an efficient algorithm that addresses these limitations.

Method: The proposed algorithm MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions. A finite-time performance analysis is provided for deterministic multi-objective problems, and asymptotic convergence is derived for stochastic problems.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that MOPBnB(so) significantly reduces computational resource requirements compared to a variant using multiple replications. Additionally, MOPBnB(so) outperforms the genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test problems.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so) is an effective algorithm for approximating the Pareto optimal set in stochastic multi-objective optimization problems, offering both finite-time performance guarantees and superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.
