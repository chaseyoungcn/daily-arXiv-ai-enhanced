In this work, we address\nthese challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We\ninterpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to\nuse a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.\nThis novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both\nthe model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also\nincorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.\nTo perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data\nmodalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a\nnovel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt\noptimization techniques with standard MCMC methods.

However, ensuring adequate\ndiversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a\nchallenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the\ndiversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion\nacross semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for\ndiversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on\nsimilar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the\nentropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance\non the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in\nlarge-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case\nof Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and\ngradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy\nmeasures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for\ndiversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on\ndifferent prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several\ntext-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves\nthe prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant\ncomputational costs.

We begin by describing a broad class of such models --\nstate space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the\nclassic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation\noperator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),\nby relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially\nnon-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization\nunifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)\nand linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new\nmodels with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per\ntoken and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such\nmodels on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic\ntasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find\nthat PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while\nmatching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases\nexhibiting better length generalization than either.", "AI": {"tldr": "Modern neural sequence models like Gated Linear Attention and Mamba achieve sequential-parallel duality.

NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software\necosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly\nalleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of\nuser programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem\nhas established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This\ndominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with\nperformance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms\nposes significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming\nparadigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language\nextensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations\nin workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur\nsubstantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary\npotential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.\nHowever, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly\nfor high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this\nlimitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA\nand corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic\noptimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based\ndata augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating\nLLM performance on CUDA transpilation.

Extensive\nexperiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual\nadvancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction\naccuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u9700\u8981\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5373\u751f\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff08PAG\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u62c5\u4efb\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89d2\u8272\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cPAG\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5728\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u751f\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u624d\u4fee\u8ba2\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u540e\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u8fd8\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPAG\u4f5c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8ba9LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPolicy as Generative Verifier (PAG)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5141\u8bb8LLMs\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u4ea4\u66ff\u626e\u6f14\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002PAG\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\u5b83\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u751f\u6210\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6b65\u9aa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u4f1a\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u8ba2\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u603b\u662f\u751f\u6210\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u6709\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86PAG\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u6211\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740PAG\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u590d\u6742\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\uff0cPAG\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765LLMs\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Quantization is a key\ntechnique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,\nPost-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video\nmatting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal\ncoherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general\nPTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our\ncontributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines\nblock-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization\nand local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization\nparameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine\nCalibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative\nstatistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer\neffects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks\nup to 20%.

Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss\nwhich use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text\noffset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is\nsimilar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of\nwords is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the\noffset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM\nmethods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between\nimage offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality\ndegrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by\nthe offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform\nan empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image\noffset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.\nOur important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is\ncorrelated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset\nmisalignment.

In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components.

Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance.
