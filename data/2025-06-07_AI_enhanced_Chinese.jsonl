In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal\nKey Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction\ngrounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the\nSymbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories\ngenerated via contractive affine maps over $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them\ninto fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key\ncontribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic\npaths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path\ngeometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension\nincreases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic\nself-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the\nentropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation\ntrials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively,\nachieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible\nentropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but\nweaker diffusion.

Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner\nis crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.\nHowever, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack\nproof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the\nvulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC\nexploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often\nincomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs\npassed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In\nthis paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and\nvalidate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first\nfully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with\nstatic and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen\nleverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating\ncandidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach\nsuccessfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the\nSecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent\nvulnerabilities.

Our\nfindings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards\ntransitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL\nmodels trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.\nMechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that\nimplement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating\nadjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among\nindirectly related items.

This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known\npre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed\ngrokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR\nthrough the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality\nmetric $\\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing\nmetrics detect only the first two. The \\emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by\ntraining for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\\alpha < 2$ and the\nappearance of \\emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the\nrandomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and\nsignal overfitting of the training set.

Building on this\ninsight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation\nPotential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's\npotential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary\nestimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential\noutcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors\nby comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention\nConfidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to\ndiscard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in\nintermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware\nReplacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively\nchallenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.\nExperiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves\nsuperior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing\ncomputational costs by over 43%.

Wearable\nsensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a\nsubstantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically\nassume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of\nLarge Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel\nSSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data\nwithout requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of\nlearnable mask tokens to model both existing (\"inherited\") and artificially\nintroduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world\ndata during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of\nday-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best\nperformance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,\nregression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits\nsuperior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even\nunder targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,\nsuch as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension\nprediction.

Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical\nmemory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,\nBest-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to\n32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource\nallocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics\nScaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on\nmodels above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,\nattention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.\nMotivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse\nattention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more\nparallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that\nsparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving\nover 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost\nregimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on\nstate-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential\nfor realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,\nwhere parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve\nthrough increased generation.

Inspired by how new\nsoftware is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be\nstudied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple\napproach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize\nnew architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of\nactivation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the\nDiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this\ntestbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax\nattention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and\nreplacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.\nNotably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for\nDiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model\n(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval\nscore. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by\nconverting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via\ngrafting.

However, in Transformer LLMs,\ngeneration cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather\nthan the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time\nhyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within\nthe same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.\nThe success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression\nmethods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make\nhyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a\nnovel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to\nachieve 8$\\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than\ntraining-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached\ntokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and\npreserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing\nthat it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load.

It balances computational efficiency, detection power, and transparency, enabling integration into existing AML workflows. Combining GARG-AML scores with tree-based methods and neighbor node scores improves its capabilities. Experiments show it outperforms state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods.", "motivation": "Money laundering poses a significant threat to the global economy, prompting regulators to impose strict controls on financial institutions. Smurfing, a common money laundering technique, involves breaking large transactions into smaller ones to evade detection. Traditional AML methods have been predominantly black-box models, which has hindered their adoption in businesses due to lack of interpretability.", "method": "The paper proposes GARG-AML, a novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk using an interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction network of each individual node. The method combines GARG-AML score calculation with different tree-based methods and incorporates the scores of neighboring nodes. It leverages the adjacency matrix of the second-order neighborhood and basic network features.", "result": "Experimental evaluations on large-scale synthetic and open-source networks demonstrate that GARG-AML outperforms current state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. It achieves a balance among computational efficiency, detection power, and transparency.", "conclusion": "GARG-AML provides a promising approach for smurfing detection by offering an interpretable metric derived from fundamental network properties. Its ability to integrate into existing AML workflows makes it a valuable tool for enhancing fraud detection."}}

These comparisons are represented as actionable\nsteps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive\nexperiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves\nsignificant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all\n5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types\nwhere all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits\nrobust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its\npractical value in real-world RAG applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u8bf8\u5982\u95ee\u7b54\uff08QA\uff09\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u5217\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6e90\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5411LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fc7\u591a\u6216\u5197\u957f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u963b\u788d\u5176\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMicro-Act\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5206\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6bd4\u8f83\u88ab\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u8868\u9762\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMicro-Act\u5728\u6240\u67095\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3\u79cd\u51b2\u7a81\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u578b\u51b2\u7a81\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0cMicro-Act\u5728\u975e\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cRAG\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u95ee\u7b54\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6e90\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u7ed9LLMs\u5e26\u6765\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aMicro-Act\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6e90\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ee5\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u8868\u9762\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cMicro-Act\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u578b\u51b2\u7a81\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMicro-Act\u5728\u975e\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "Micro-Act\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u975e\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645RAG\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

QiMeng comprises three hierarchical\nlayers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor\nChip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and\ninference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data\nscarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the\nmiddle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference\ncapabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design\nAgent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.\nCurrently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully\napplied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages\nand providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated\nhardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on\nintegrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up\ndesign processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Processor chip design faces challenges due to fabrication technology, resource demands, and ecosystem diversity.

For systems without\nanalytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation\nstrategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of\nlow-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,\nfacilitating interpretable and reliable modeling.

SVCT builds upon VCT by ensuring model faithfulness through Denoised Diffusion Smoothing, enhancing decision-making capabilities while maintaining stability against perturbations.", "result": "Experiments conducted on four medical datasets show that both VCT and SVCT maintain high accuracy and interpretability compared to baselines. Notably, SVCT provides stable and faithful explanations even under input perturbations.", "conclusion": "The proposed VCT and SVCT models successfully bridge the utility gap and address faithfulness issues in concept-based models.

Under review", "summary": "Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and\nneurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer\ninterfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional\nmethods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight\nbut often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent\nTransformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong\ngeneralization performance, but typically have much larger computational\nrequirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time\nsettings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid\narchitecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention\nmodule with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and\ncausal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to\nnew sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We\nevaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical\ndecoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical\napplications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.\nNotably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings\nimproves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the\nexciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find\nthat POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nTransformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).\nThese results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the\ngap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural\ndecoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "POSSM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u56e0\u679c\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPOSSM \u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684 Transformer \u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u540e\u8005\u7684\u4e5d\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u800c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "POSSM \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e2a\u522b\u5c16\u5cf0\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSM\uff09\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u56e0\u679c\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "POSSM \u5728\u7334\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u624b\u5199\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb9\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "POSSM \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u95ed\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
