### [1] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This article proposes a conjecture that highlights the trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in AI systems. The conjecture reframes engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI, with implications for evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to make explicit and open to rigorous verification the implicit trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in AI systems, which has been historically present in the development of AI technologies.

Method: The article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology.

Result: The analysis of the conjecture's implications clarifies how it would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design if proven correct.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of proving or refuting the inequality proposed by the conjecture for the future development of trustworthy AI.

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

### [2] [One Patient, Many Contexts: Scaling Medical AI Through Contextual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10157)
*Michelle M. Li,Ben Y. Reis,Adam Rodman,Tianxi Cai,Noa Dagan,Ran D. Balicer,Joseph Loscalzo,Isaac S. Kohane,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 医疗基础模型包括训练临床笔记的语言模型、医学图像的视觉-语言模型以及电子健康记录的多模态模型。这些模型可以总结临床笔记、回答医学问题并辅助决策。然而，它们在新人群、专科或环境中的适应通常需要微调、仔细提示或从知识库中检索，这限制了它们解释不熟悉输入和调整未在训练中表示的临床情况的能力。因此，模型容易出现上下文错误。本文提出了一种医疗AI的情境切换愿景：无需重新训练即可动态调整其推理以适应新的专科、人群、工作流程和临床角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的医疗AI模型在面对新的人群、专科或环境时，需要微调、提示或检索才能适应，这限制了它们的能力。并且，这些模型容易出现上下文错误，无法动态调整行为以适应医疗护理的演变情境。

Method: 提出一种医疗AI的情境切换愿景，使模型能够动态适应新的专科、人群、工作流程和临床角色，而无需重新训练。

Result: 通过情境切换AI，可以诊断、管理和治疗各种疾病，并扩大对医疗服务的获取。

Conclusion: 本文概述了一种医疗AI的情境切换愿景，期望AI能够动态适应不同的医疗情境，从而扩展医疗服务的覆盖范围。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

### [3] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the difference between causation and correlation in Alzheimer's disease research using a combination of methods including XGBoost, SHAP values, and classical statistical analysis. It aims to improve early diagnosis and targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the distinction between causation and correlation in Alzheimer's disease which can lead to improved early diagnosis and targeted interventions.

Method: Combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification (XGBoost), and model interpretability techniques (SHAP values).

Result: Identified key features influencing AD classification, revealed clusters of interrelated variables, and provided insights into feature contributions across disease stages.

Conclusion: Strong correlations do not necessarily imply causation; integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical statistical analysis lays groundwork for future causal inference studies.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

*Filip Cano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The thesis advances knowledge in safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability of AI systems by proposing new techniques such as delayed observation resilient shields, fairness shields, and a formal framework for assessing intentional behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With autonomous systems increasingly influencing critical societal domains, there is an imperative to ensure responsible use of artificial intelligence. The concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and multi-faceted, requiring advancements in specific areas.

Method: Extended classical deterministic shielding techniques to be resilient against delayed observations; implemented deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated autonomous vehicles; introduced fairness shields as a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness; proposed a formal framework for assessing intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents.

Result: Validated the use of safety shields in realistic driving simulators; developed a method that efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference; provided metrics useful for determining responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm.

Conclusion: The advancements contribute practically to the realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

### [5] [WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10264)
*Qiyue Yin,Pei Xu,Qiaozhe Li,Shengda Liu,Shengqi Shen,Tong Wang,Yihong Han,Xiaonan Zhao,Likun Yang,Shiyue Cao,Shiyu Qiu,Yuxuan Liu,Shizhao Yu,Lei Cui,Chengxin Yan,Jie Sun,Xiangquan Tang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved AI's reasoning abilities, but strategic reasoning has not been thoroughly evaluated. This paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. It assesses LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic reasoning is a critical component of advanced human cognition that has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled in LLMs. The authors aim to address this gap by creating a benchmark for assessing LLMs' strategic reasoning abilities.

Method: The paper introduces WGSR-Bench, which uses wargames as an evaluation environment. It designs test samples around three core tasks: Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling, and Policy generation, forming the S-POE architecture.

Result: WGSR-Bench provides a systematic way to assess LLMs' strategic reasoning abilities, including multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: With WGSR-Bench, the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic strategic reasoning can be assessed, advancing research in large model-driven strategic intelligence.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

### [6] [Closer to Language than Steam: AI as the Cognitive Engine of a New Productivity Revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10281)
*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper reinterprets AI as a cognitive engine akin to written language, marking a new productivity revolution that amplifies human intellect and reshapes work and society.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical framework for understanding AI's role in driving a cognitive productivity revolution distinct from past industrial revolutions.

Method: By comparing AI's emergence to historical leaps in information technology and adopting a multidisciplinary perspective combining computer science, economics, and sociology.

Result: Demonstrates AI's impact as a driver of productivity in cognitive tasks across various domains and visualizes the shift from manual to cognitive productivity.

Conclusion: AI functions as an engine of cognition, complementing human abilities and demanding a rethinking of skills, organizations, and policies to fully realize its potential.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

### [7] [The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304)
*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the computational complexity barriers in verifying AI safety as system capabilities increase, formalizing the Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic and presenting a strategic trilemma for AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI safety as system capabilities scale.

Method: Through four core theorems, the paper proves that verification complexity grows exponentially with system expressiveness, safe policies comprise a small fraction of the policy space, no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal coverage, and robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural networks.

Result: Verification complexity grows exponentially with system expressiveness. Safe policies are a very small fraction of the policy space. No finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal coverage. Robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural networks.

Conclusion: AI development faces a strategic trilemma: constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms beyond verification.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [8] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了VGC-Bench，一个用于测试AI在Pokémon VGC游戏中跨多种队伍配置的泛化能力的基准。尽管在单一队伍配置上表现良好，但随着队伍规模增大，现有算法的性能下降，表明策略泛化仍是一个未解决的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体学习中，开发能够在不重新训练的情况下适应不同战略环境的AI代理是一个核心挑战。Pokémon VGC游戏提供了一个具有极其庞大的团队配置空间（约10^139），其离散和组合性质导致最优策略随团队和对手的变化而显著变化，使得泛化变得特别困难。

Method: 引入了VGC-Bench基准，它提供了关键基础设施、标准化评估协议以及人类游戏数据集。使用了一系列基线方法进行实验，包括大型语言模型代理、行为克隆、强化学习以及基于博弈论的方法如自我对弈、虚构对弈和双重预言等。

Result: 在单一队伍配置的受限设置下，所提出的方法能够击败专业VGC选手。然而，在更大规模的团队集合上评估所有基线方法时发现，即使在单一队伍设置中表现最佳的算法也难以随着团队规模的增加而扩展性能。

Conclusion: 政策在多样化团队策略上的泛化仍然是社区面临的开放性挑战。项目代码已开源至https://github.com/cameronangliss/VGC-Bench。

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Optimus-3 is a new general-purpose agent for Minecraft that surpasses existing models and agents through innovations in data generation, task interference mitigation, and multimodal reasoning-augmented reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a generalist agent capable of perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft, addressing challenges such as insufficient domain-specific data, task interference, and visual diversity.

Method: 1) Knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline for scalable and high-quality training data. 2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing to mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks. 3) Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance reasoning ability for visual diversity.

Result: Optimus-3 outperforms both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across various tasks in the Minecraft environment.

Conclusion: The paper presents Optimus-3, a successful general-purpose agent for Minecraft that overcomes key challenges in developing agents for open-world environments.

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that combines NEAT with PAL to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training in StarCraft: Brood War. The method accelerates learning and exhibits emergent expert behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: StarCraft: Brood War is a challenging AI research benchmark due to its need for long-term strategic planning. Traditional approaches have limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency.

Method: NeuroPAL integrates Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning (PAL). It alternates between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity evaluations to enhance sample efficiency and accelerate strategy discovery.

Result: NeuroPAL agents reach competitive levels of play in about half the training time required by NEAT alone and exhibit expert human player strategies such as proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL can significantly enhance the scalability and effectiveness of neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. To solve this problem, we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module and Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm.

Motivation: These agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains.

Method: We propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of insufficient knowledge and Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm to bridge the domain gap.

Result: Experimental results show that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32%, 19%, 15%, and 79% on AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

Conclusion: HMS module and SA-MCTS algorithm improve the performance of GUI agents in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into predefined reasoning and agentic reasoning systems, analyzing techniques and proposing future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of early RAG systems in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration by shifting towards Reasoning Agentic RAG.

Method: Comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing into predefined reasoning (fixed modular pipelines) and agentic reasoning (autonomous tool interaction) systems, analyzing architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination.

Result: Identification of key research challenges and proposal of future directions to enhance flexibility, robustness, and applicability of Reasoning Agentic RAG systems.

Conclusion: Reasoning Agentic RAG represents a promising paradigm for advancing RAG systems, with ongoing research needed to address challenges and unlock full potential.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing has strict resource constraints that challenge traditional autoscaling methods, prompting the need for more flexible and multi-dimensional scaling approaches.

Method: An agent-based autoscaling framework is introduced which dynamically adjusts hardware resources and service configurations. Four types of agents are compared - Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference - using YOLOv8 and OpenCV as real-world processing services.

Result: All agents achieved acceptable SLO performance with different convergence patterns. The Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, structural analysis converges quickly, and deep active inference combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence for the feasibility of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling in edge environments, encouraging further research in this area.

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a benchmark to assess LLMs' logical planning and reasoning skills over complex relational structures, which are crucial for applications generating and querying structured graphs of relations.

Method: Developed LogiPlan benchmark with dynamic variation of task complexity by controlling objects, relations, and minimum depth of relational chains. Evaluated state-of-the-art models across three complementary tasks: Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question, and assessed their self-correction capabilities.

Result: Significant performance gaps were found among models that correlate with model scale and architecture. Recent reasoning-enhanced models perform well on simpler instances but struggle with more complex configurations.

Conclusion: LogiPlan provides a fine-grained assessment of LLMs' logical planning and reasoning capabilities, revealing strengths and limitations in handling complex relational structures.

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

*Mohd Anwar Jamal Faiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence combining classical primality with modular digit-based conditions. It proposes this sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic at scale.

Method: The authors define the Primender sequence and design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test a hypothesis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the sequence.

Result: Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to assess model performance.

Conclusion: This work contributes a novel mathematical construct and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a diagnostic approach for complex cyber-physical systems that needs minimal prior knowledge, combining a neural network-based symptom generator with a new graph diagnosis algorithm. Experiments show its effectiveness in practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require extensive prior knowledge which is hard to obtain.

Method: The method combines a neural network-based symptom generator using subsystem-level anomaly detection with a new graph diagnosis algorithm leveraging minimal causal relationship information between subsystems.

Result: Experiments with simulated datasets show that the true causal component is included in 82% of cases and reduces search space in 73% of scenarios. Tests on real-world dataset also show potential for practical use.

Conclusion: The approach has potential for practical applications in large and complex cyber-physical systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of LLMs in solving domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks within telecommunications, where this area remains largely unexplored despite advancements in general mathematical reasoning.

Method: Introduced TeleMath - a benchmark dataset of 500 QnA pairs covering various telecommunications topics. Evaluated open-source LLMs using this dataset, starting from a seed of problems crafted by experts.

Result: Models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning performed best on TeleMath, while general-purpose models struggled regardless of parameter count.

Conclusion: TeleMath provides valuable insights into LLM capabilities in telecommunications mathematics; its release aims to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a pipeline that formalizes and verifies constraints for AML models, making complex modeling rules semi-automatically checkable without requiring users to understand formal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering but lacks automatic validation for its typically informal and textual constraints.

Method: The paper introduces a pipeline which maps AML models to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. Then, a Large Language Model translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, validated against the generated AML ontology. Lastly, SHACL validation results are interpreted in natural language.

Result: The approach demonstrates that even complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked using this method.

Conclusion: This pipeline allows for the verification of AML modeling constraints without users needing to understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system that can effectively handle real number computations for reasoning about continuous changes by combining answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories.

Method: The method involves creating a compiler named aspsmt2smt which translates ASPMT programs into SMT instances. This allows the use of SMT solvers like z3 to compute stable models. The system uses gringo for partial grounding of input programs.

Result: The system successfully handles real number computations and reasoning about continuous changes, demonstrating its effectiveness in this domain.

Conclusion: The aspsmt2smt compiler effectively bridges ASP and SMT, enabling the computation of stable models for ASPMT programs and providing a useful tool for reasoning with continuous changes.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a

through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments
show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to
0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the issue of toxicity in drug development which leads to early-stage failures. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, there has been no systematic definition or benchmarking for molecular toxicity repair.

Method: The authors introduce ToxiMol, a benchmark task for MLLMs focused on molecular toxicity repair. They construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules. A prompt annotation pipeline is designed with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities. An automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, is also proposed.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while MLLMs show potential in molecular toxicity repair, significant challenges remain. The introduction of ToxiMol and ToxiEval provides a foundation for future research in this area.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint

### [27] [Spurious Rewards: Rethinking Training Signals in RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10947)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in enhancing mathematical reasoning, particularly in Qwen2.5-Math-7B model, showing significant performance improvements even with spurious rewards. However, these rewards are model-specific and do not yield similar results across different model families. The study highlights the potential of RLVR in uncovering pretraining knowledge and suggests future research should validate on diverse models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how RLVR can improve mathematical reasoning capabilities in language models, especially when using spurious rewards that have little to no correlation with correct answers.

Method: Employed RLVR with various types of spurious rewards (random, format, incorrect label, 1-shot RL, majority voting) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model and compared its performance against ground truth rewards.

Result: RLVR significantly improved MATH-500 performance in Qwen2.5-Math-7B, with gains ranging from 13.8% to 27.1%, nearly matching the 29.1% improvement from ground truth rewards. Code reasoning behavior became more frequent after RLVR application. Spurious rewards effective for Qwen did not yield similar results in other model families.

Conclusion: RLVR may surface useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining when explicit reward signals are absent. Future RLVR research should consider validating on a variety of models instead of focusing solely on one.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

TL;DR: The paper presents an MCIL method using multimodal pre-trained models, including MIFE, AAVFM, contrastive training loss, and new evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in integrating complementary information from vision, audio, and text modalities while mitigating catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL).

Method: Proposes MIFE for incremental fine-tuning, AAVFM for enhancing feature discriminability and generalization, a novel contrastive training loss for cross-modal alignment optimization, and two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics.

Result: Extensive experiments on three multimodal datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed MCIL method effectively integrates vision, audio, and text modalities while addressing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

### [29] [NOCL: Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM for Graph Tasks without Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10014)
*Wei Li,Mengcheng Lan,Jiaxing Xu,Yiping Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graphs are crucial for modeling complex interactions. Traditional Graph Neural Networks (MPNNs) rely on supervised learning, which limits their generalization in label-scarce scenarios. Self-supervised approaches still require labeled fine-tuning, limiting zero-shot effectiveness. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language but face challenges with graphs. This paper proposes NOCL, a framework that uses node description and node concept techniques to convert node attributes into structured natural language, significantly reducing token lengths. NOCL unifies graph tasks into a shared query format, showing competitive supervised performance and superior zero-shot generalization compared to MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models when applied to graphs, particularly in label-scarce and zero-shot scenarios.

Method: The proposed method is the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL), which leverages two core techniques: 1) node description, converting heterogeneous node attributes into structured natural language; 2) node concept, encoding node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained language models. Additionally, NOCL employs graph representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a shared, language-based query format.

Result: Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: NOCL provides a new direction for Graph Foundation Models by effectively addressing the limitations of previous methods, showcasing strong performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统薄膜光学逆向设计方法耗时且需要大量数值模拟与优化，因此研究新的高效方法成为必要。

Method: 使用深度学习中的串行神经网络（TNN）进行SiO2/TiO2多层薄膜的传输光谱逆向设计，其中TNN由逆向神经网络和预训练前向神经网络串联而成，并采用MLP、CNN或LSTM算法配置。

Result: LSTM-LSTM基础的TNN精度最高但训练时间最长；CNN-LSTM基础的TNN在精度和速度上为最佳解决方案。

Conclusion: 深度学习，尤其是TNN结构，可有效解决薄膜光学逆向设计中的一对多映射问题，提高设计效率和准确性。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

TL;DR: Omni-DPO is a new framework that improves DPO by considering both data quality and model performance, leading to better training data use and results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO-based methods treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring variations in quality and learning utility, which leads to suboptimal data use and performance.

Method: Omni-DPO is a dual-perspective optimization framework that considers the inherent quality of each preference pair and the model's evolving performance on those pairs. It adaptively weights samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training.

Result: On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats Claude 3 Opus by 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms baseline methods across all benchmarks.

Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在解决现实任务中表现出色，但其不确定性量化仍是关键问题，且受限于封闭源代码、黑箱性质以及对提示工程的高度敏感性。

Conclusion: 本研究为将贝叶斯方法融入LLM时代提供了可行路径，有助于构建更可靠、更校准的LLM系统。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the kernelized bandit problem with an unknown reward function in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), seeking computationally efficient algorithms that can achieve good regret bounds.

Method: Introduced the GP-Generic class of algorithms utilizing exploration distributions, which includes UCB-based approaches and allows for various randomized algorithms. The method focuses on careful selection of exploration distribution to realize effective concrete algorithms.

Result: Achieves $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret bounds, matching known results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms, and demonstrates that randomization can lead to better practical results.

Conclusion: The proposed GP-Generic algorithm provides a flexible framework for kernelized bandit problems, achieving competitive regret bounds and showing potential advantages through randomization.

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel federated multi-task learning method that uses cross-client similarity for personalized learning, feature anchors for communication efficiency, shared classification heads, and graph-based regularization to enable client collaboration. It also employs a community detection approach to ensure positive knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of personalization in federated learning while maintaining communication efficiency and preventing negative collaboration among clients.

Method: The method involves creating a feature anchor for each client to summarize local features, sharing classification heads among clients, using graph-based regularization to model client collaboration as a dynamic graph, and applying community detection to partition the graph into homogeneous communities for positive interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments on two heterogeneous datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, computation and communication efficiency, and fairness across clients.

Conclusion: The novel federated multi-task learning method effectively leverages cross-client similarity for personalized learning, achieves high efficiency in communication and computation, and ensures fair performance across clients.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

*Arnaud Fickinger,Abderrahim Bendahi,Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores Offline Domain Randomization (ODR) for reinforcement learning agents to reduce the sim-to-real gap. It formalizes ODR as maximum-likelihood estimation, proves consistency of the estimator, derives gap bounds showing tighter sim-to-real error than uniform DR, and introduces E-DROPO, an improved version of DROPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement-learning agents face challenges when transitioning from simulation to real-world deployment due to the sim-to-real gap. While domain randomization (DR) is a common strategy to mitigate this issue by training policies across various simulators with sampled dynamics parameters, standard DR does not leverage offline data from real systems.

Method: The authors formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood estimation over a parametric simulator family. They prove the consistency of this estimator under certain conditions and derive gap bounds to show that ODR has a tighter sim-to-real error compared to uniform DR. Additionally, they introduce E-DROPO, which enhances DROPO by adding an entropy bonus to avoid variance collapse.

Result: The theoretical analysis demonstrates that ODR can effectively reduce the sim-to-real gap with tighter error bounds compared to uniform DR. The introduction of E-DROPO shows practical improvements in broader randomization and more robust zero-shot transfer.

Conclusion: ODR provides a theoretically grounded approach to reducing the sim-to-real gap in reinforcement learning by leveraging offline data. The proposed E-DROPO algorithm further enhances the practical effectiveness of ODR.

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

*Daniel Lawson,Adriana Hugessen,Charlotte Cloutier,Glen Berseth,Khimya Khetarpal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过结合BYOL-γ增强的目标条件行为克隆（GCBC），提出了一种新的表示学习目标，该方法无需对比样本或时序差分学习即可逼近继承者表示，并在需要组合泛化的任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）方法在训练任务上表现良好，但在要求对新状态-目标对进行零样本泛化的任务上存在局限性，这可能归因于行为克隆中学到的状态表示缺乏时间一致性。如果相关的时间状态被编码为相似的潜在表示，则可以减少新状态-目标对的分布外差距，从而促进组合泛化。

Method: 提出了一种简单的表示学习目标——BYOL-γ增强的GCBC，该方法理论上可以在有限马尔可夫决策过程中逼近继承者表示，而无需对比样本或时序差分学习。继承者表示编码了从当前状态访问的未来状态分布，能够很好地体现时间一致性属性。

Result: 在一系列需要组合泛化的挑战性任务中，所提出的方法在经验性能上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强的GCBC方法不仅能够在不需要对比样本或时序差分学习的情况下逼近继承者表示，而且在需要组合泛化的任务中表现良好。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

*Mohammad Taufeeque,Aaron David Tucker,Adam Gleave,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究人员通过部分逆向工程分析了一个使用无模型强化学习训练的卷积递归神经网络（RNN），该网络用于玩拼图游戏Sokoban。他们发现这个网络在测试时利用计算资源的方式类似于经典的双向搜索算法，但也有不同之处。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前的研究表明，这个神经网络在解决更多关卡时需要更多的测试时间计算资源，但其内部机制尚未被深入理解。因此，本文旨在揭示这种网络如何利用测试时间计算资源来解决问题。

Method: 通过分析每个方格的计划表示、与特定方向相关的通道激活以及这些状态-动作激活的类比价值函数，研究者揭示了类似经典双向搜索的机制。此外，还探讨了专门内核如何扩展这些激活以创建路径，形成过渡模型。最后，对比了该算法与经典搜索的不同之处，例如状态表示不是统一的，网络分别考虑每个盒子，每层有自己的计划表示和价值函数。

Result: 研究表明，这个RNN网络在测试时利用计算资源的方式可以被理解为类似经典双向搜索的机制，并且可以通过熟悉的概念来解释。

Conclusion: 尽管是通过无模型训练学习到的机制，但利用测试时间计算资源的方式可以被理解为熟悉的概念，这表明深度学习模型的决策过程并非完全不可理解。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

*Andrei V. Konstantinov,Vlada A. Efremenko,Lev V. Utkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes three novel survival models (iSurvM, iSurvQ, and iSurvJ) that integrate imprecise probability theory with attention mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. These models outperform the Beran estimator in accuracy and computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survival analysis methods struggle with complex data structures and heavy censoring.

Method: The paper introduces three models: iSurvM uses Mean likelihood functions; iSurvQ uses Quantiles of likelihood functions; iSurvJ uses Joint learning. Censored observations are represented by interval-valued probability distributions. Kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson regression with trainable attention weights is used for computing imprecise probability distribution over time intervals. Three decision strategies correspond to the three models.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed models, particularly iSurvJ, consistently outperform the Beran estimator in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The introduced models provide a better solution for handling censored data in survival analysis.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

*Yaowen Zhang,Libera Fresiello,Peter H. Veltink,Dirk W. Donker,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework PMB-NN is proposed for heart rate estimation during daily activities, which combines physiological constraints with neural networks, offering personalized and accurate monitoring possibilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heart failure poses a significant global health challenge, and early detection through abnormalities in heart rate could improve outcomes. Current methods for HR estimation lack efficiency and interpretability.

Method: The study introduces a physiological-model-based neural network (PMB-NN) framework that embeds physiological constraints from a simplified human movement physiological model into the neural network training process, using oxygen uptake data during physical activities.

Result: The PMB-NN model achieved high accuracy with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm, performing on par with benchmark models while outperforming traditional physiological models.

Conclusion: The proposed PMB-NN framework enables personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily physical activities, providing future opportunities for precise VO2 estimation systems derived from body movements.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

### [45] [Balanced Hyperbolic Embeddings Are Natural Out-of-Distribution Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10146)
*Tejaswi Kasarla,Max van Spengler,Pascal Mettes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Balanced Hyperbolic Learning, which uses hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings for better discrimination of in- and out-of-distribution samples. It introduces a method to optimize class embeddings in hyperbolic space, enhancing OOD detection across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution (OOD) recognition is crucial in deep learning to filter out samples not belonging to the training distribution. Current methods lack effectiveness in discriminating between in- and out-of-distribution samples.

Method: The authors introduce Balanced Hyperbolic Learning with a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that optimizes hierarchical distortion and balancing. They use these embeddings as prototypes for classification and adapt existing OOD scoring functions for hyperbolic space.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that their hyperbolic embeddings surpass existing OOD approaches, outperform other hyperbolic methods, beat state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and support hierarchical OOD generalization.

Conclusion: Hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings are advantageous for discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

*Minoh Jeong,Seonho Kim,Alfred Hero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), which incorporates uncertainty quantification into contrastive learning methods, achieving better performance and providing meaningful uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic embeddings learned by current contrastive learning methods lack a principled mechanism for uncertainty quantification.

Method: VCL is a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit hypersphere. It models the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings.

Result: Experiments show that VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: VCL equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation, serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

*Zahra Shahrooei,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) is proposed to improve sample efficiency in continuous control tasks with sparse rewards by using a directed exploration strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms are leading in continuous control domains but suffer from poor sample efficiency, particularly in environments with sparse rewards.

Method: The WBSAC algorithm incorporates a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor for promoting exploration. The exploration policy is defined as the Wasserstein barycenter of these two policies, allowing for adjustable exploration during the learning process.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that WBSAC outperforms state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms in terms of sample efficiency on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The WBSAC algorithm provides a principled directed exploration strategy that enhances sample efficiency in reinforcement learning environments with sparse rewards.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In this paper, authors uncover the geometric regularity in deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion-based generative models. They find that each simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace and has an almost identical 'boomerang' shape. Based on this discovery, they propose a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure, which requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance.

Motivation: To explore the geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion-based generative models and use this knowledge to improve the image generation performance.

Method: Reveal the geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics and propose a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure.

Result: The proposed strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function evaluations.

Conclusion: The geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics can be used to improve the image generation performance of diffusion-based generative models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE is a framework that performs representation learning and adaptive OOD detection, evolving with data to capture new trends through non-parametric clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world observational data contain heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. Current models tend to overlook these groups leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: DynaSubVAE jointly performs representation learning and adaptive OOD detection. It dynamically updates its latent structure to capture new trends using a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism inspired by Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: DynaSubVAE achieves competitive performance in near-OOD and far-OOD detection and excels in class-OOD scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. The dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone clustering methods like GMM and KMeans++ in terms of OOD accuracy and regret precision.

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE provides an effective solution for capturing emerging patterns in data through its dynamic subgrouping approach.

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

*Sajjad Karimi,Amit J. Shah,Gari D. Clifford,Reza Sameni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between ECG and PCG using machine learning models, demonstrating that nonlinear models offer better reconstruction performance and that clinically relevant ECG biomarkers can be estimated from PCG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the common and exclusive characteristics of ECG and PCG signals, their potential for mutual reconstruction, and biomarker extraction under varying physiological conditions and across individuals.

Method: Using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise, linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, were employed to reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability.

Result: Nonlinear models, especially non-causal LSTM, provided superior reconstruction performance. Reconstructing ECG from PCG was more feasible than the reverse. Envelope-based modeling improved cross-subject generalizability for cross-modal learning. Clinically relevant ECG biomarkers could be estimated from PCG in cross-subject settings.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of the relationship between electromechanical cardiac modalities, with implications for novel multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

*Chen-Chia Chang,Wan-Hsuan Lin,Yikang Shen,Yiran Chen,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An automation method for analog topology design named LaMAGIC2 is introduced, which improves on previous methods by enhancing component-type recognition, reducing token length complexity and improving numeric precision sensitivity. Experiments show that LaMAGIC2 has higher success rates, lower MSEs and better transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.

Method: LaMAGIC2 uses a succinct float-input canonical formulation with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation. SFCI improves component-type recognition through identifier-based representations, reduces token length complexity to O(|V|), and enhances numeric precision sensitivity.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a prior method. It also exhibits better transferability for circuits with more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement.

Conclusion: These advancements establish LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a

*Yuji Kawamata,Kaoru Kamijo,Maki Kihira,Akihiro Toyoda,Tomoru Nakayama,Akira Imakura,Tetsuya Sakurai,Yukihiko Okada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DC-Clustering, a new federated clustering method that supports complex data partitioning scenarios and achieves performance comparable to centralized clustering while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL-based clustering methods typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed structures.

Method: DC-Clustering is a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. Each institution shares only intermediate representations instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication with the central server.

Result: Extensive experiments using synthetic and open benchmark datasets show that DC-Clustering achieves clustering performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its

### [59] [Meta-learning Representations for Learning from Multiple Annotators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10259)
*Atsutoshi Kumagai,Tomoharu Iwata,Taishi Nishiyama,Yasutoshi Ida,Yasuhiro Fujiwara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning method is proposed to learn accurate classifiers from multiple noisy annotators by leveraging related tasks' data and estimating annotators' abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In scenarios like crowdsourcing, labels provided by multiple annotators may be noisy due to varying skills or biases. Existing methods need large amounts of such noisy data to learn accurate classifiers, but sufficient data might not always be available.

Method: The method uses labeled data from different but related tasks. It embeds each example into a latent space using a neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning task-specific classifiers while estimating annotators' abilities in the latent space. The neural network is meta-learned to improve test classification performance when adapting to a small amount of annotated data via the EM algorithm.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on real-world datasets with synthetic noise and real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-learning approach can efficiently leverage related tasks' data and estimate annotators' abilities to improve classifier accuracy even with limited data.

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

*Ryota Ueda,Takami Sato,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation is a promising approach for neural network verification, but faces challenges when applied to deep networks due to interior-point vanishing. This paper identifies this limitation and proposes five solutions to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the critical limitation in the SDP relaxation method when applied to deep networks, specifically the issue of interior-point vanishing that leads to the loss of strict feasibility, creating a barrier to scaling SDP-based verification.

Method: Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, the authors demonstrate the loss of strict feasibility as the depth of DNNs increases. They then design and investigate five solutions to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem, also re-examining the valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit.

Result: The proposed methods can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing methods, accounting for 41% of the total. The re-examination of constraints reveals they are not only unbeneficial but harmful to the problem's feasibility.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and secure systems with DNNs.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

*Jiajin Liu,Dongzhe Fan,Jiacheng Shen,Chuanhao Ji,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in multimodal data processing, but existing MMG learning methods lack a unified benchmark for fair evaluation. This paper introduces Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates three MLLM-based paradigms across six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in the field of multimodal graph learning where there is no unified benchmark to fairly evaluate different approaches.

Method: The paper presents Graph-MLLM, which systematically evaluates three paradigms of MMG learning methods: MLLM-as-Encoder, MLLM-as-Aligner, and MLLM-as-Predictor across six datasets with different domains.

Result: Experiments show that jointly considering visual and textual attributes benefits graph learning, converting visual attributes into textual descriptions improves performance, and fine-tuning MLLMs on specific MMGs achieves state-of-the-art results in most scenarios without explicit graph structure information.

Conclusion: The authors hope that the open-sourced Graph-MLLM library will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further research in multimodal graph learning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

*Moïse Blanchard,Vineet Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In a grouped multi-armed bandit setting where groups share reward observations, the paper introduces Col-UCB algorithm to minimize collaborative regret and balance exploration burden among groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard algorithms in multi-armed bandits can lead to imbalanced exploration cost between groups. This paper aims to address this issue by studying the impact of sharing exploration in a grouped setting.

Method: The authors introduce an algorithm named Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates exploration across groups in a grouped bandit setting where groups have overlapping feasible action sets and share reward observations.

Result: Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors, adapting to the structure of shared action sets between groups.

Conclusion: Collaboration through the Col-UCB algorithm provides significant benefits over each group learning their best action independently, as it balances the exploration burden and minimizes collaborative regret.

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in large language models (LLMs) under two fine-tuning paradigms. They propose two attacks and demonstrate success across multiple pretrained LLMs, revealing a vulnerability in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding whether property inference attacks transfer to large language models (LLMs), especially those fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets with sensitive information.

Method: The authors introduce PropInfer, a benchmark task built on the ChatDoctor dataset, to evaluate property inference in LLMs under question-answering and chat-completion paradigms. They also propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that the proposed attacks are successful across multiple pretrained LLMs, indicating a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

Conclusion: Property inference attacks can be successfully applied to large language models, revealing a significant vulnerability that needs to be addressed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

*Luc Raszewski,Christine De Kock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using meta-learning for malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia, which improves prediction precision compared to pre-trained models and releases a new dataset for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malicious sockpuppet detection is crucial for maintaining reliable information online. Existing machine learning methods focus on stylistic and meta-data features but lack adaptability to author-specific behaviours, especially in data-scarce settings.

Method: The paper applies meta-learning, a technique designed for rapid adaptation in data-scarce settings, to optimize a model's ability to adapt to the writing style of new sockpuppet-groups.

Result: Meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to pre-trained models in detecting sockpuppets.

Conclusion: Meta-learning offers an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open editing platforms like Wikipedia and contributes to future research by releasing a new dataset.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

*Paul Janson,Benjamin Therien,Quentin Anthony,Xiaolong Huang,Abhinav Moudgil,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learned optimizers have made progress but are still hard to access. This paper introduces PyLO, a PyTorch-based library that makes learned optimizers more accessible and effective for real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to make learned optimizers more accessible to the broader machine learning community by addressing the limitations of existing methods, such as reliance on JAX and lack of user-friendly packages after meta-training.

Method: PyLO is a PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine learning community through familiar workflows. It includes a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture, which delivers substantial speedups for training ViT B/16. PyLO also allows easy combination with existing optimization tools like learning rate schedules and weight decay.

Result: The introduction of PyLO has led to substantial speedups in training throughput for ViT B/16, from 39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec. Additionally, learned optimizers can substantially benefit when combined with existing optimization tools.

Conclusion: PyLO provides a more accessible and effective way to use learned optimizers for real-world large-scale pre-training tasks, benefiting from its integration with existing optimization tools.

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution poses a significant health risk in developing countries. Official AQI data often fails to capture local realities due to sparse sensor distribution.

Method: Employ Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting AQI values within 1 km^2 neighborhoods using the AirDelhi dataset.

Result: Achieved a 79% reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to existing methods, demonstrating effectiveness even on unseen coordinates.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal GNNs offer an effective solution for high-resolution AQI prediction, uncovering valuable patterns and providing publicly available code.

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM) agents. The authors aim to provide a principled framing of these decision problems which has been lacking so far.

Method: The authors formalize the LLF problem, assert sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce transfer eluder dimension as a complexity measure. They also develop HELiX, a no-regret algorithm that solves LLF problems through sequential interactions.

Result: The authors demonstrate cases where learning from rich language feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. HELiX performs well across several empirical domains even when repeatedly prompting LLMs does not work reliably.

Conclusion: This work marks a first step towards designing principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

This design outperforms existing methods on multi-modal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis.

Method: A novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, leveraging two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG and a unified multi-modal framework integrating pretrained EEG model.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior performance and sets new baselines in downstream tasks, effectively addressing challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch.

Conclusion: The wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

### [69] [History-Aware Neural Operator: Robust Data-Driven Constitutive Modeling of Path-Dependent Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10352)
*Binyao Guo,Zihan Lin,QiZhi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study introduces History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), a novel end-to-end learning framework using neural operators for modeling path-dependent inelastic materials. HANO overcomes self-consistency issues, mitigates sensitivity to initial hidden states, and accommodates varying path discretizations. Evaluated on elastoplasticity and anisotropic damage benchmarks, HANO shows superior performance in predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an effective data-driven surrogate model for simulating path-dependent inelastic materials that can overcome the limitations of RNN-based models such as self-consistency issues and sensitivity to initial hidden states.

Method: The authors propose HANO, an autoregressive model based on Fourier neural operator backbone with embedded hierarchical self-attention mechanism for multiscale feature extraction. This model predicts material responses from short segments of strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, enabling discretization-invariant learning and accommodating varying path discretizations.

Result: HANO outperforms baseline models in terms of predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness when evaluated on elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive anisotropic damage in brittle solids benchmark problems. The model exhibits robust performance under complex conditions including irregular sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states.

Conclusion: HANO provides an effective data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials, overcoming key limitations of previous approaches. It is well-suited for integration with classical numerical solvers and has demonstrated capabilities in modeling complex material behaviors.

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

*Yu-Yang Qian,Yuan-Ze Xu,Zhen-Yu Zhang,Peng Zhao,Zhi-Hua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeLoRA is a novel approach for efficient continual learning of large pre-trained models using hierarchical gradient similarity, bandit techniques and sparse gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently updating large pre-trained models in a continual learning setting without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Construct layer-wise adapters using hierarchical gradient similarity, employ bandit techniques for efficient task similarity estimation, and use sparse gradient updates for parameter optimization.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency on both vision transformers and large language models across various domains.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA enables efficient continual learning particularly suited for large pre-trained models.

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Conclusion: PAJAMA provides a more cost-effective, reliable, and flexible alternative for evaluating LLM generations and responses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for estimating fire progression using VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height data through a conditional Generative Adversarial Network trained with WRF-SFIRE simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an increasing need for wildfire spread prediction due to rising wildfire occurrences. Current models diverge from observed progressions during multi-day simulations, necessitating the use of data assimilation.

Method: A conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) is developed and trained with historic wildfire simulations from WRF-SFIRE model. The cGAN uses VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height data to estimate fire progression represented by fire arrival time.

Result: The approach was validated on five Pacific US wildfires, achieving an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81 when compared against high-resolution perimeters measured via aircraft. It was also found that terrain has minimal influence on the arrival time inference when conditioned on satellite measurements.

Conclusion: The study successfully developed a method for estimating fire progression using a cGAN trained with WRF-SFIRE simulations, showing promising results in accurately predicting wildfire spread.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Motivation: 现实世界中的时间序列数据（如医疗、气候建模和金融）往往是不规则、多模态且杂乱的，而现有基准通常假设数据干净、规则采样且单模态，这导致研究与实际应用之间存在巨大差距。

Method: 提出了 Time-IMM 数据集，涵盖九种不同的时间序列不规则类型，并分为触发机制、约束机制和伪影机制。同时引入 IMM-TSF 基准库，包含时间戳到文本融合模块和多模态融合模块，支持基于最近性的平均和注意力机制集成策略。

Conclusion: Time-IMM 和 IMM-TSF 为在真实条件下推进时间序列分析提供了基础。

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

Motivation: SOC monitoring needs representative field sampling locations based on environmental covariates.

Method: Propose hybrid spectral-cLHS method, using spectral clustering to partition study area into homogeneous zones and cLHS to select sampling locations within each zone.

Result: Spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS.

Conclusion: This improved sampling design may yield more accurate SOC predictions by providing better-balanced training data.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

Motivation: To address the shortage of skilled engineers and time-consuming manual optimizations in PCB design that often lead to higher costs and electronic waste.

Method: Representing PCB schematics as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to automate the addition of new components.

Result: GNNs can solve PCB design optimization tasks with high accuracy when applied to real-world datasets labeled by human experts.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for automating PCB design optimizations efficiently in terms of time and cost.

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

### [82] [Size-adaptive Hypothesis Testing for Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10586)
*Antonio Ferrara,Francesco Cozzi,Alan Perotti,André Panisson,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified, size-adaptive hypothesis-testing framework to assess algorithmic fairness by proving Central-Limit results for large subgroups and deriving Bayesian estimators for small intersectional groups, ensuring statistically rigorous decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current practices of assessing algorithmic fairness through single point estimates are statistically brittle, ignoring sampling error and treating demographic subgroups equally regardless of size. This issue is exacerbated in intersectional analyses where data becomes sparse for smaller groups.

Method: The authors introduce a two-part framework: (i) For large subgroups, they prove a Central-Limit theorem for statistical parity difference leading to analytic confidence intervals and Wald tests with controlled type-I error; (ii) For small intersectional groups, they derive a Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimator providing calibrated credible intervals.

Result: Empirical validation on benchmark datasets shows that the proposed tests provide interpretable and statistically rigorous decisions across varying levels of data availability and intersectionality.

Conclusion: This size-adaptive framework enhances the reliability of fairness assessments by accounting for subgroup size and providing robust statistical methods for both large and small demographic groups.

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

### [84] [Deep Learning-Based Digitization of Overlapping ECG Images with Open-Source Python Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10617)
*Reza Karbasi,Masoud Rahimi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie,Hadi Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-stage pipeline for digitizing paper-based ECG recordings, especially those with signal overlaps. The first stage uses a U-Net based segmentation network to isolate the primary ECG trace, and the second stage converts the binary mask into a time-series signal using enhanced digitization techniques. Experimental results show that this method significantly improves upon existing techniques in terms of MSE and Pearson Correlation Coefficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately digitizing paper-based ECG recordings remains a challenge, particularly when dealing with single leads compromised by signal overlaps. Existing methodologies do not adequately address this issue.

Method: The method involves a two-stage pipeline: 
1. A U-Net based segmentation network trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and custom data augmentations to isolate the primary ECG trace.
2. Conversion of the refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module.

Result: The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for segmentation. For non-overlapping signals, the proposed method has an MSE of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366 for the baseline. For overlapping signals, the proposed method has an MSE of 0.0029 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.9641, compared to 0.0178 and 0.8676 for the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage pipeline significantly enhances the accuracy of digitizing ECG recordings, especially those with signal overlaps, providing a reliable conversion of analog ECG records into digital data for research and clinical applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

### [85] [Leveraging Low-rank Factorizations of Conditional Correlation Matrices in Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10628)
*Thu Ha Phi,Alexandre Hippert-Ferrer,Florent Bouchard,Arnaud Breloy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph learning framework that uses a low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix to efficiently learn undirected graphs from data at each node, with scalable optimization tools derived for Riemannian optimization and application to a low-rank GLasso algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning an undirected graph from data gathered at nodes is computationally challenging due to scaling issues with the number of variables (nodes), especially in high-dimensional settings.

Method: The method involves leveraging a low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix within a graph signal processing framework, deriving optimization tools for Riemannian optimization, and applying this to a low-rank constrained version of the GLasso algorithm.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate an efficient trade-off between dimensionality and performance using this approach.

Conclusion: The proposed graph learning framework effectively addresses scalability issues in high-dimensional settings through low-rank factorization and Riemannian optimization techniques.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

*Yucheng Yang,Tianyi Zhou,Qiang He,Lei Han,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Meng Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for unseen downstream tasks. This paper introduces a novel disentanglement metric LSEPIN, proposes a new skill-learning objective WSEP and an algorithm PWSEP based on Wasserstein distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the shortcomings of Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) in unsupervised reinforcement learning, specifically its lack of sufficient theoretical analysis regarding how well its learned skills can initialize a downstream task's policy.

Method: The authors propose a novel disentanglement metric LSEPIN, build an information-geometric connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost, investigate a strategy replacing KL divergence with Wasserstein distance, leading to a new skill-learning objective WSEP, and finally propose another algorithm PWSEP based on Wasserstein distance.

Result: The proposed methods, WSEP and PWSEP, are theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and capable of discovering more initial policies or even all optimal initial policies for downstream tasks compared to MISL.

Conclusion: This paper provides a new theoretical analysis for mutual information skill learning in URL, proposes LSEPIN, WSEP and PWSEP which improve upon MISL by offering better geometric properties and potentially discovering more or all optimal initial policies for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: To advance time series forecasting, the paper proposes Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for enhancing LLMs' multi-step reasoning ability with fine-grained rewards and GRIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for time series forecasting primarily rely on historical pattern extraction without explicit intermediate reasoning. While slow-thinking LLMs show potential for multi-step reasoning, prompt engineering has limitations such as high cost and privacy risks.

Method: The proposed method, Time-R1, is a two-stage framework: supervised fine-tuning in the first stage for adaptation and reinforcement learning in the second stage to improve generalization. It includes a multi-objective reward design and GRIP for optimizing reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments indicate that Time-R1 significantly enhances forecast performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: Time-R1 effectively improves LLMs' multi-step reasoning ability for time series forecasting, offering a promising approach to overcome limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method for analyzing the latent space geometry of generative models by reconstructing the Fisher information metric, providing theoretical convergence guarantees and demonstrating its effectiveness on statistical physics models and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a deeper understanding of the latent space geometry in generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models, through reconstruction of the Fisher information metric.

Method: The method involves approximating the posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples, using this approximation to learn the log-partition function which defines the Fisher metric for exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities when validated on the Ising and TASEP models. When applied to diffusion models, it reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric, with geodesic interpolations being approximately linear within individual phases but breaking down at phase boundaries where the Lipschitz constant diverges.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the complex structure of diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase transitions.

### [89] [Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10647)
*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain of Thought (CoT) improves transformers' ability to solve complex problems like the $k$-parity problem, but its effectiveness is challenged by data shifts and poisoned training data. This paper investigates these impacts on model quality, revealing that CoT can sometimes perform worse than direct prediction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite CoT's proven effectiveness in enhancing transformers' capabilities, it relies on assumptions such as identical training/testing distributions and clean data with correct reasoning steps which may not always hold true in real-world scenarios. Thus, there is a need to understand how distribution shifts and data poisoning affect models trained using CoT.

Method: The authors focus on the $k$-parity problem and examine the joint effects of two types of data shifts - distribution shifts and data poisoning - on the quality of models trained with CoT. They provide both empirical analysis and theoretical explanations for their findings.

Result: The study uncovers an unexpected outcome where CoT performs worse in learning parity compared to directly generating predictions. The technical results offer a detailed explanation of why this occurs mechanistically.

Conclusion: This work highlights the vulnerabilities of CoT under certain conditions and calls for further research into more robust approaches against data shifts and poisoning.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

TL;DR: SatSOM is introduced to address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for SOMs by incorporating a saturation mechanism that freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning is crucial for neural systems, but they often face the problem of catastrophic forgetting when dealing with sequential tasks. Existing SOMs also suffer from this issue.

Method: The paper proposes Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM), which uses a saturation mechanism to gradually decrease the learning rate and neighborhood radius as neurons accumulate information, thus freezing well-trained neurons and redirecting learning to underutilized areas.

Result: This approach improves knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios for SOMs.

Conclusion: SatSOM provides an effective solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in SOMs during continual learning.

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

TL;DR: 现代神经网络常常编码任务无关的不必要概念，引发公平性和可解释性问题。现有的事后方法虽能去除不良概念但可能会削弱有用信号。本文提出SPLICE方法，在去除敏感概念的同时精确保持与目标标签的协方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络不仅编码任务相关信息，还可能引入不公平或难以解释的概念，这可能导致模型的偏见和歧视。为了解决这一问题，需要一种能够有效去除不良概念而不损害主要任务信息的方法。

Method: SPLICE（Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal and Covariance prEservation）通过斜投影技术从表示中去除不需要的方向，同时保护重要标签的相关性。理论上，它是唯一在去除线性概念预测能力的同时，最大程度保持目标协方差并最小化嵌入失真的解决方案。

Result: 在Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中，SPLICE表现优于基线方法，成功去除了受保护属性，同时对主任务信息的损害极小。

Conclusion: SPLICE提供了一种有效的方法来消除表示中的敏感概念，同时保留了与目标标签的重要协方差关系，为解决神经网络中的公平性和可解释性问题提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has advanced with models like TabPFN and TabICL, but they are limited by synthetic data training or context size. ConTextTab combines the strengths of both worlds by integrating semantic understanding into a table-native ICL framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current tabular ICL architectures that either lack real-world data training or have limited context usage, aiming to leverage rich semantics and world knowledge in real-world tabular data.

Method: ConTextTab employs specialized embeddings for different data modalities and is trained on large-scale real-world tabular data, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework.

Result: ConTextTab is competitive with state-of-the-art models across various benchmarks and sets a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

Conclusion: ConTextTab successfully combines architectural efficiency with deep semantic understanding, advancing tabular in-context learning.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands

Result: 得到了几乎匹配的上下界，适用于ϵ的整个范围。

Conclusion: 这是首次对单调分类问题中的最低成本进行的研究，并成功实现了误差仅比最优解高相对因子的目标。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new energy function called log-sum-ReLU (LSR) for Dense Associative Memory networks, inspired by optimal kernel density estimation. It uses the Epanechnikov kernel to enable exact memory retrieval without exponential separation functions and introduces emergent local minima while preserving perfect pattern recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve upon existing energy functions for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) networks, particularly addressing limitations of the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function.

Method: The method involves proposing a novel energy function, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), which is based on the Epanechnikov kernel from optimal kernel density estimation. This function allows exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity without needing exponential separation functions.

Result: Empirical results show that LSR has significantly more local minima (memories) with comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models. Analysis on image datasets reveals creativity and novelty in LSR's emergent memories.

Conclusion: LSR provides a promising approach for both large-scale memory storage and generative tasks due to its ability to introduce numerous emergent local minima while maintaining perfect pattern recovery.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

TL;DR: The paper explores the efficiency robustness of Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs), presenting a taxonomy of efficiency adversarial attacks and analyzing strategies that target DDLSs, while also examining current defense mechanisms and their limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically explore the efficiency robustness of DDLSs and understand how adversarial attacks exploit dynamic behaviors to degrade system performance.

Method: Categorizing attacks based on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference, (ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic output production for downstream tasks. Evaluating adversarial strategies targeting DDLSs efficiency and investigating existing defense mechanisms.

Result: Identified key challenges in securing DDLSs and demonstrated limitations of current defense mechanisms against efficiency attacks.

Conclusion: There is a necessity for novel mitigation strategies to secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Motivation: The rise of digital payments has increased the need for intelligent and scalable systems to detect fraud.

Method: An end-to-end, feature-rich machine learning framework is developed. It includes merging datasets, feature engineering, and using unsupervised models like Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder. PCA visualizations and clustering methods (K-Means and DBSCAN) are also used.

Result: Unsupervised models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as outliers. PCA visualizations show the ability to separate anomalies. Clustering methods identify dense clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

Conclusion: This research provides an effective approach for detecting credit card transaction anomalies and fraud.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

*Pierre-François Massiani,Alexander von Rohr,Lukas Haverbeck,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how entropy regularization and constraints penalization in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) can promote robust safety under unknown disturbances. It shows that entropy regularization biases learning towards maximizing viable actions, improving resilience to action noise. Relaxing strict safety constraints through penalties allows the constrained RL problem to be approximated by an unconstrained one, maintaining safety and optimality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of creating policies in RL that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown disturbances.

Method: Analyze the interplay between entropy regularization and constraints penalization in model-free RL, revealing that entropy regularization inherently promotes constraints satisfaction robust to action noise and showing that relaxing strict safety constraints through penalties can approximate the constrained RL problem closely by an unconstrained one.

Result: This approach preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving resilience to disturbances.

Conclusion: The connection between entropy regularization and robustness is a promising area for further empirical and theoretical investigation in achieving robust safety in RL.

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Motivation: 现有的攻击方法不适用于随机集成分类器（有限混合分类器），因此需要一种合理的方式攻击此类模型并改进攻击特性。

Method: 通过几何分析定义攻击的两种理想属性：有效性和最大性；分析现有攻击方法未能满足这些属性的原因；提出一种新的攻击方法——格点爬升攻击，并提供其在二元线性设定下的理论支持。

Result: 格点爬升攻击在合成和真实数据集上表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 格点爬升攻击为攻击混合分类器提供了一种新的有效工具，未来可进一步扩展到更复杂的模型和场景中。

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

TL;DR: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models can be improved by leveraging Gaussian diffusion techniques, resulting in faster training and sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models have the potential for fast text generation but are typically outperformed by other models.

Method: The Duo method transfers techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve training and sampling in uniform-state discrete diffusion models. This includes curriculum learning guided by the Gaussian process and Discrete Consistency Distillation.

Result: Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Sampling is accelerated by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Duo improves both training and sampling in uniform-state discrete diffusion models.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

### [103] [NoLoCo: No-all-reduce Low Communication Training Method for Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10911)
*Jari Kolehmainen,Nikolay Blagoev,John Donaghy,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Christopher Nies*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes NoLoCo, an optimization method for training large language models that significantly reduces communication overhead by implicitly synchronizing model weights without explicit parameter synchronization or collective communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models typically requires expensive, high-bandwidth clusters due to the need for frequent parameter synchronization. Current low-communication methods still involve costly synchronization steps over low-bandwidth networks.

Method: NoLoCo is an optimization method that avoids explicit synchronization of all model parameters during training. It uses a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer to partially average model weights with randomly selected ones, thus achieving implicit synchronization without collective communication.

Result: NoLoCo requires significantly less communication overhead compared to fully sharded data parallel training and DiLoCo. The synchronization step is estimated to be one magnitude faster than all-reduce used in DiLoCo for few hundred accelerators training over the internet. Additionally, it shows up to 4% faster convergence rate compared to DiLoCo across various model sizes and accelerator counts.

Conclusion: NoLoCo offers a promising approach to reduce communication costs while maintaining or improving convergence rates in large-scale model training.

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

TL;DR: CausalFM是一个全面的框架，用于在各种因果推理场景中训练基于PFN的基础模型。它通过结构化因果模型以原则性方式构建贝叶斯先验，并提出了一种新的先验分布族，使用因果启发式贝叶斯神经网络。实验表明，CausalFM在各种合成和半合成基准上对条件平均处理效应（CATE）估计具有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管先前数据拟合网络（PFNs）已被提出作为一种有前途的方法来训练表格基础模型，但尚未有一个综合框架可以在各种因果推理场景中训练这些模型。因此，需要一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 首先，形式化基于结构化因果模型构建因果推理的贝叶斯先验，并推导出这些先验有效性的必要标准。然后，提出一个新型的先验分布家族，使用因果启发式贝叶斯神经网络，使CausalFM能够在各种场景下进行贝叶斯因果推理。最后，实例化CausalFM并明确地训练一个基础模型，用于使用后门调整估计条件平均处理效应（CATE）。

Result: CausalFM在各种合成和半合成基准上展示了其对条件平均处理效应（CATE）估计的竞争性能。

Conclusion: CausalFM提供了一个通用的方案，可以用于训练各种因果推理场景中的基础模型，为医学、经济学等领域的从业者提供了改变因果推理方式的新范式。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

TL;DR: 现代神经序列模型结合了并行训练和快速顺序推理的能力。本文探讨了具有近常数时间并行评估和线性时间、常数空间顺序推理的神经序列模型，并提出了Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs)的概念，它统一了许多现有架构，并在实验中表现出良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望找到一类神经序列模型，这类模型可以支持近常数时间的并行评估和线性时间、常数空间的顺序推理，以满足现代神经序列模型对并行训练和快速顺序推理的需求。

Method: 首先描述了一类广泛的模型——状态空间模型，其状态更新可以通过经典的并行前缀扫描算法计算。然后通过放宽状态聚合算子，定义了一个更通用的类别——Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs)，允许使用任意（可能非关联）函数如softmax attention。这一概括统一了许多现有的架构，并引入了新的模型。

Result: 在小规模语言建模和典型合成任务上的实证评估表明，PSMs保留了基于transformer架构的表达能力，同时匹配了状态空间模型的推理效率，在某些情况下表现出比两者更好的长度泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的状态空间模型和PSMs为构建高效神经序列模型提供了新的思路，这些模型在保持表达能力的同时提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) used in hiring can develop significant racial and gender biases when realistic context is introduced, despite anti-bias prompts. The study proposes an internal bias mitigation method that identifies and neutralizes sensitive attributes within model activations, effectively reducing bias to very low levels while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of simple anti-bias prompts in eliminating demographic biases in LLMs when realistic contextual details are introduced in hiring applications.

Method: The method involves identifying race and gender-correlated directions within model activations and applying affine concept editing at inference time to neutralize these sensitive attribute directions.

Result: This intervention robustly generalizes across various commercial and open-source models, reducing bias to typically under 1%, always below 2.5%, while largely preserving model performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies to ensure equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽强大但静态，缺乏适应新任务、知识或示例的机制。本文提出Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL)框架，使LLMs能通过生成自己的微调数据和更新指令进行自我适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型尽管功能强大，但它们是静态的，无法根据新任务、知识或示例调整其权重。这促使研究者探索一种能让LLM自行调整权重的方法。

Method: SEAL框架让LLM通过生成自己的微调数据和更新指令来实现自适应。给定新输入后，模型会产生自我编辑生成内容，可能重新组织信息、指定优化超参数或调用工具进行数据增强和基于梯度的更新。这些自我编辑通过监督微调导致持续的权重更新，从而实现持久的适应性。为了训练模型产生有效的自我编辑，使用强化学习循环，其中更新模型的下游性能作为奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，在知识融合和少量样本泛化方面，SEAL在语言模型能够自我指导适应的方向上迈出了有希望的一步。

Conclusion: SEAL是一种有前景的方法，它使语言模型能够进行自我指导的适应，与依赖单独适应模块或辅助网络的先前方法不同，SEAL直接利用模型自身的生成来控制其适应过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

TL;DR: 提出GUARD框架，通过数据归因指导大语言模型的遗忘与保留，减少无意遗忘，提高模型效用保存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型中，遗忘特定数据可能会无意中损害模型的效用和保留有价值的信息，而现有方法在遗忘高影响数据时往往保留能力下降。

Method: 引入轻量级代理数据归因度量，设计新的遗忘目标，根据代理归因分数分配自适应的非均匀遗忘权重。

Result: 理论保证和实验表明，GUARD显著提高了保留能力，同时保持了与先前方法相当的遗忘指标。在TOFU基准测试中，当遗忘10%的训练数据时，GUARD将保留集上的效用牺牲减少了多达194.92%（按真实比率计算）。

Conclusion: GUARD框架能有效缓解无意遗忘，显著改善大语言模型在遗忘过程中的效用保存。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of large language models not utilizing execution feedback during inference, which is a critical signal used by human programmers.

Method: Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG) incorporates execution signals as the model generates code through a multi-stage process including beam search for candidate completions, extracting execution signals by running test cases, and incorporating these signals into the prompt during generation.

Result: EG-CFG significantly enhances code generation performance compared to standard methods, achieving state-of-the-art results across various coding tasks from basic problems to competitive programming challenges.

Conclusion: EG-CFG demonstrates the potential of integrating execution signals in neural code generation, improving performance and providing coherent guidance while preserving syntactic structure.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

*Xing Han Lù,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper suggests a paradigm shift in web agent research by introducing the concept of an Agentic Web Interface (AWI), designed specifically for agents to navigate websites, with six guiding principles emphasizing safety, efficiency, and standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agent approaches face challenges due to the mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities, struggling with the complexity of web inputs.

Method: Introduce the concept of Agentic Web Interface (AWI) with six guiding principles for its design to optimize interaction for agents.

Result: Aims to overcome limitations of existing interfaces for more efficient, reliable, and transparent web agent design.

Conclusion: Calls for a collaborative effort involving the broader ML community to develop AWI, optimizing web navigation for AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

### [112] [ReGuidance: A Simple Diffusion Wrapper for Boosting Sample Quality on Hard Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10955)
*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance is a simple wrapper that enhances the sample realism and reward of pretrained diffusion models when solving hard inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained diffusion models have been used for solving inverse problems, but in cases with low signal-to-noise ratio, current techniques fail to produce realistic outputs. There's a need for methods that can improve sample quality and measurement consistency in such challenging scenarios.

Method: The ReGuidance method takes a candidate solution produced by another algorithm, inverts it by running an unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting from this solution, and then uses the resulting latent as an initialization for Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS).

Result: When applied on top of state-of-the-art baselines for hard inverse problems, ReGuidance significantly improves sample quality and measurement consistency.

Conclusion: ReGuidance not only boosts sample realism and reward but also comes with theoretical guarantees that it enhances both the reward and brings solutions closer to the data manifold in certain multimodal data distributions.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

*Zhaiming Shen,Alexander Hsu,Rongjie Lai,Wenjing Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the theoretical aspects of in-context learning (ICL) for regression tasks involving Hölder functions on manifolds, connecting attention mechanisms with kernel methods and deriving generalization error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand in-context learning (ICL), especially for structured geometric data like Hölder functions on manifolds.

Method: Establish a connection between the attention mechanism and classical kernel methods to derive generalization error bounds related to prompt length and number of training tasks.

Result: Transformers achieve minimax regression rates for Hölder functions on manifolds when enough training tasks are observed. Generalization error scales with the number of training tasks and intrinsic dimension of the manifold.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of geometry in ICL and provides new tools for analyzing nonlinear models.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Farseer is a new scaling law that improves predictive accuracy for Large Language Models (LLMs) training strategies, reducing extrapolation errors by 433% compared to previous methods like Chinchilla's law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs is very expensive and insights from small-scale experiments don't always transfer well to large-scale production systems. This creates a 'scaling gap' that hinders innovation in the field.

Method: The researchers developed Farseer by constructing a model loss surface L(N,D). This approach fits empirical data better than previous laws, providing accurate, robust, and generalizable predictions across different scales.

Result: Farseer reduces extrapolation error by 433% compared to Chinchilla's law, allowing reliable evaluation of training strategies at all scales. The team validated their approach by training about 1,000 LLMs using approximately 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours.

Conclusion: Farseer offers enhanced understanding of optimal compute allocation for LLM training and bridges the scaling gap. All models, data, results, and logs are open-sourced to promote further research.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

*Julius Berner,Miguel Liu-Schiaffini,Jean Kossaifi,Valentin Duruisseaux,Boris Bonev,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to convert popular neural architectures into neural operators for solving scientific problems involving function spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of neural networks in scientific applications due to disparities between infinite-dimensional function spaces and finite-dimensional spaces typically handled by deep learning models.

Method: Identify key principles for constructing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces and propose a recipe to convert existing neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.

Result: Provides a practical guide for practitioners to implement neural operators effectively, enabling them to learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs.

Conclusion: This approach aims to bridge the gap between deep learning and scientific computing, offering potential transformative impact on solving complex scientific problems.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

### [116] [Rethinking Losses for Diffusion Bridge Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10982)
*Sebastian Sanokowski,Lukas Gruber,Christoph Bartmann,Sepp Hochreiter,Sebastian Lehner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion bridges are deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions. Despite the Log Variance (LV) loss typically outperforming the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss, this study argues that for diffusion bridges, the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) avoids conceptual problems and consistently outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results show samplers trained with rKL-LD achieve better performance, require less hyperparameter optimization, and exhibit more stable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why the Log Variance (LV) loss outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss in diffusion models and determine if this holds true for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned.

Method: Analyze the gradients of the LV and rKL losses when using reparametrization and log-derivative tricks for diffusion samplers. Compare the theoretical underpinnings and practical outcomes of using the LV loss versus the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) in diffusion bridges.

Result: The rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) avoids conceptual problems associated with the LV loss and consistently outperforms it in diffusion bridges. Models trained with rKL-LD showed better performance on challenging benchmarks, required less hyperparameter tuning, and exhibited more stable training behavior.

Conclusion: For diffusion bridges, the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick is preferable over the LV loss due to both its theoretical soundness and practical advantages.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

*Kyubyung Chae,Hyunbin Jin,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a framework that uses LLM attack techniques to generate synthetic data for model alignment, significantly increasing harmful response rates in experiments and improving model robustness when used for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and time associated with human-labeled preference data for aligning large language models, by utilizing synthetic data generation methods that do not rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models.

Method: RAAI detects internal refusal signals within LLMs and adaptively injects predefined phrases to produce harmful yet fluent completions, effectively 'jailbreaking' the LLMs.

Result: Experiments showed an increase in harmful response rates from 2.15% to up to 61.04% across four benchmarks. Fine-tuning LLMs with RAAI-generated synthetic data improved robustness against harmful prompts while maintaining general capabilities on standard tasks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LLM attack methodologies can be transformed into tools for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset with 3,520 jailbreaking prompts to assess LLMs' robustness against generating malicious code. Experiments reveal mainstream LLMs have limited ability to reject such requirements, especially when multiple jailbreak methods are combined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks in code generation, which can lead to malicious outputs.

Method: Proposed MalwareBench, a dataset with 3,520 jailbreaking prompts based on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories.

Result: Mainstream LLMs show limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, with an average rejection rate of 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak attack algorithms.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant challenges in code security capabilities, indicating a need for improvement.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

*Elena Sofia Ruzzetti,Giancarlo A. Xompero,Davide Venditti,Fabio Massimo Zanzotto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Private Memorization Editing (PME), a method to prevent private data leakage by mitigating the memorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Large Language Models (LLMs). PME edits the model's knowledge of its training data, reducing leaked PII and increasing robustness against privacy attacks without affecting the language model's underlying performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs potentially memorizing and leaking sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from their uncontrolled training data.

Method: Private Memorization Editing (PME) detects memorized PII and reduces its memorization by editing the model's knowledge of its training data. This turns LLMs' memorization ability into a privacy defense strategy.

Result: PME effectively reduces the number of leaked PII across various configurations, even reducing the accuracy of privacy attacks to zero in some cases.

Conclusion: PME can prevent private data leakage in LLMs without affecting the underlying language model's performance, making it more robust against Training Data Extraction attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even

QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect the copyright of contributed data in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that evolve into service-oriented platforms with shared knowledge bases.

Method: Proposes AQUA, a watermark framework embedding semantic signals into synthetic images via acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues, ensuring watermark propagation from image retriever to textual generator.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing across diverse models and datasets.

Conclusion: AQUA fills a key gap in multimodal RAG protection by providing a method for image knowledge protection.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the structural features of the abc conjecture by generating integer triples with low radical values for potential applications in cryptography.

Method: Using powers of 2 and 3 combined with modular inversion in Z/3^pZ to create a parametric identity with residue constraints. Then applying affine transformations to embed these triples into a broader space optimised for the ratio log c / log rad(abc).

Result: Generated abc-triples exhibit low radical values and include both known and novel examples. The method provides structured, radical-minimising candidates.

Abstract: We present a symbolic identity for generating integer triples $(a, b, c)$

conjecture}. The construction uses powers of $2$ and $3$ in combination with
modular inversion in $\mathbb{Z}/3^p\mathbb{Z}$, leading to a parametric
identity with residue constraints that yield abc-triples exhibiting low radical
values. Through affine transformations, these symbolic triples are embedded
into a broader space of high-quality examples, optimised for the ratio $\log c
/ \log \operatorname{rad}(abc)$. Computational results demonstrate the
emergence of structured, radical-minimising candidates, including both known
and novel triples. These methods provide a symbolic and algebraic framework for
controlled triple generation, and suggest exploratory implications for symbolic
entropy filtering in cryptographic pre-processing.

### [126] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenBreak, a framework that fine-tunes a red-team LLM to explore vulnerabilities in T2I models, combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to craft adversarial prompts that enhance evasion and toxicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on adversarial attacks against T2I models either generates highly toxic images with easily detectable prompts or focuses on bypassing safety mechanisms without producing genuinely harmful outputs. There is a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety of defended T2I models.

Method: Propose GenBreak, a framework that fine-tunes a red-team LLM using supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets and reinforcement learning via interaction with a surrogate T2I model. It integrates multiple reward signals to guide the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and image toxicity while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity.

Result: The crafted adversarial prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety weaknesses.

Conclusion: GenBreak addresses the gap in reliable tools for evaluating the safety of defended T2I models by systematically exploring underlying vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

*David Farr,Kevin Talty,Alexandra Farr,John Stockdale,Iain Cruickshank,Jevin West*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) for software vulnerability assessment in Python code with known Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). It compares zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot in-domain prompting strategies. Results show that few-shot prompting improves classification performance, especially when combined with confidence-based routing strategies. LLMs can generalize across vulnerability categories with minimal examples, but challenges like model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial robustness persist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As cyber threats become more sophisticated, there is a need for rapid and accurate vulnerability detection to maintain secure systems.

Method: The study simulates the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and compares zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot in-domain prompting strategies using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: Few-shot prompting significantly enhances classification performance compared to zero-shot prompting. Confidence-based routing strategies improve efficiency by involving human experts only in cases of high model uncertainty. LLMs can effectively generalize across vulnerability categories with minimal examples.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential as scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However, challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial robustness remain critical areas for future research. Integrating AI-driven approaches with expert-in-the-loop decision-making highlights a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows.

Abstract: As cyber threats become more sophisticated, rapid and accurate vulnerability
detection is essential for maintaining secure systems. This study explores the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by
simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness
Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot
in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot
prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances
classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based
routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases
where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and
expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across
vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as
scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However,
challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial
robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven
approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights
a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our
findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection
systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational
resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.

### [128] [D-LiFT: Improving LLM-based Decompiler Backend via Code Quality-driven Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10125)
*Muqi Zou,Hongyu Cai,Hongwei Wu,Zion Leonahenahe Basque,Arslan Khan,Berkay Celik,Dave,Tian,Antonio Bianchi,Ruoyu,Wang,Dongyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: D-LiFT is an automated decompiler backend that uses reinforcement learning to train large language models (LLMs) for improving the quality of decompiled code while preserving accuracy and enhancing readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing decompilers suffer from syntactic and semantic errors, and prior attempts to use LLMs for refining decompiler output have limitations such as introducing new errors and unreliable accuracy validation.

Method: Proposes D-LiFT which employs LLMs trained via reinforcement learning. Central to D-LiFT is D-SCORE, a quality assessment system that ensures accuracy before evaluating readability. D-SCORE verifies syntactic and semantic correctness using a compiler and symbolic execution, then evaluates readability with established metrics.

Result: D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions compared to baseline LLMs without D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, demonstrating significant improvements in the accurate decompiled code from real-world projects.

Conclusion: D-LiFT effectively enhances the quality of decompiled code by preserving accuracy and improving readability, as evidenced by its successful application in projects like coreutils and util-linux.

Abstract: Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary
executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances,
their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains
difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),
researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.
Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,
such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.
In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that
harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving
accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of
decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.
Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system
to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,
D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher
scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,
D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler
and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then
evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with
the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for
fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,
demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the
coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without
D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled
functions, as measured by D-SCORE.

*Lucas Truax,Sandip Roy,Laszlo B. Kish*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces KLJN as a method to secure satellite communications, offering simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness compared to QKD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find a more practical and cost-effective method for securing satellite communications against advanced computational threats, including quantum computing.

Method: KLJN scheme which utilizes classical physics principles, operating with standard electronic components and wires.

Result: KLJN provides unconditional security that is impervious to environmental and radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable for satellite communications.

Conclusion: KLJN offers significant advantages over QKD in terms of simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making it a practical choice for many secure communication applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) as an
approach to securing satellite communications. KLJN has the potential to
revolutionize satellite communication security through its combination of
simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and resilience with unconditional security.
Unlike quantum key distribution (QKD), which requires complex, fragile, and
expensive infrastructure like photon detectors and dedicated optical links,
KLJN operates using standard electronic components and wires, significantly
reducing implementation costs and logistical hurdles. KLJN's security, grounded
in the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental
and radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions
of satellite communications. This robustness, coupled with its ability to
integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, positions KLJN as a
revolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient
satellite communications. The authors explore the value of achieving
unconditionally secure communications in strategic ground-to-satellite networks
which address vulnerabilities posed by advanced computational threats,
including quantum computing. Our team has examined two leading approaches to
unconditional security - the KLJN scheme and QKD - and analyzed the potential
use of each for space systems. While QKD leverages quantum mechanics for
security, it faces challenges related to cost, complexity, and environmental
sensitivity. In contrast, the KLJN scheme utilizes classical physics principles
to provide a simpler, more cost-effective, and resilient alternative,
particularly for ground-based systems. The study concludes that KLJN offers
significant advantages in simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making
it a practical choice for many secure communication applications.

### [130] [Disclosure Audits for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10171)
*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Large Language Model agents are increasingly used in roles requiring access to sensitive data, posing privacy risks. This study introduces the CMPL framework, a diagnostic tool that audits conversational privacy through multi-turn interactions, revealing latent vulnerabilities missed by single-turn defenses. It also provides an auditing procedure with quantifiable risk metrics and an open benchmark for evaluating conversational privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the growing concern of unauthorized disclosures from Large Language Model agents in various applications, there is a need for a systematic way to quantify and audit these privacy risks.

Method: The proposed CMPL framework uses an iterative probing strategy to simulate realistic multi-turn interactions, aiming to uncover latent vulnerabilities in agents enforcing strict privacy directives. It goes beyond focusing on single disclosure events.

Result: The evaluation across diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations shows the framework's effectiveness in revealing privacy risks not deterred by existing single-turn defenses.

Conclusion: This study proposes CMPL as a diagnostic tool for auditing conversational privacy, accompanied by an auditing procedure based on quantifiable risk metrics and an open benchmark for evaluating conversational privacy in different agent implementations.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

*Nanda Rani,Sandeep Kumar Shukla*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AURA is a multi-agent framework that uses retrieval-augmented generation and large language models to correlate threat behaviors with known APT groups, providing automated, interpretable, and expert-aligned attributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective APT attribution requires the ability to correlate behavioral patterns and reason over complex threat intelligence artifacts.

Method: AURA ingests diverse threat data and processes it through a network of collaborative agents designed for intelligent query rewriting, context-enriched retrieval, and natural language justification. It combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: Experiments on recent APT campaigns demonstrate AURA's high attribution consistency, expert-aligned justifications, and scalability.

Conclusion: AURA represents a promising direction for transparent, data-driven, and scalable threat attribution using multi-agent intelligence.

Abstract: Effective attribution of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) increasingly
hinges on the ability to correlate behavioral patterns and reason over complex,
varied threat intelligence artifacts. We present AURA (Attribution Using
Retrieval-Augmented Agents), a multi-agent, knowledge-enhanced framework for
automated and interpretable APT attribution. AURA ingests diverse threat data
including Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), Indicators of Compromise
(IoCs), malware details, adversarial tools, and temporal information, which are
processed through a network of collaborative agents. These agents are designed
for intelligent query rewriting, context-enriched retrieval from structured
threat knowledge bases, and natural language justification of attribution
decisions. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large
Language Models (LLMs), AURA enables contextual linking of threat behaviors to
known APT groups and supports traceable reasoning across multiple attack
phases. Experiments on recent APT campaigns demonstrate AURA's high attribution
consistency, expert-aligned justifications, and scalability. This work
establishes AURA as a promising direction for advancing transparent,
data-driven, and scalable threat attribution using multi-agent intelligence.

*Marius Mehrl,Mila Pfander,Theresa Winner,Cornelius Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Autocrats use secret police to maintain power, but surprisingly, they are not present in all autocracies. This paper explores the conditions under which secret police emerge in dictatorships using statistical variable selection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why secret police do not exist in all autocracies and under what conditions they emerge.

Method: Apply statistical variable selection techniques to identify explanatory variables from literature on state security forces and authoritarian survival.

Result: Secret police are more likely to emerge when rulers face specific threats like protests and have material resources to establish these organizations.

Conclusion: This research enhances our understanding of autocrats' institutional choices and authoritarian politics.

Abstract: Autocrats use secret police to stay in power, as these organizations deter
and suppress opposition to their rule. Existing research shows that secret
police are very good at this but, surprisingly, also that they are not as
ubiquitous in autocracies as one may assume, existing in less than 50% of
autocratic country-years. We thus explore under which conditions secret police
emerge in dictatorships. For this purpose, we apply statistical variable
selection techniques to identify which of several candidate variables extracted
from the literature on state security forces and authoritarian survival hold
explanatory power. Our results highlight that secret police are more likely to
emerge when rulers face specific, preempt-able threats, such as protests and
anti-system mobilisation, but also when they have the material resources to
establish these organisations. This research contributes to our understanding
of autocrats' institutional choices and authoritarian politics.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study reveals that some machine unlearning methods are ineffective against prompt attacks, with ELM being particularly vulnerable while RMU and TAR show robustness. The research challenges assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and provides an evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of various machine unlearning methods when subjected to prompt attacks and determine if supposedly unlearned knowledge can still be retrieved.

Method: Systematically evaluate eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis methods to test the retrieval of unlearned knowledge.

Result: Methods like RMU and TAR demonstrate strong unlearning capabilities, whereas ELM remains susceptible to specific prompt attacks. Logit analysis shows that unlearned models generally do not hide knowledge by altering answer formatting.

Conclusion: Current assumptions about the effectiveness of unlearning may be incorrect, and there is a need for better evaluation frameworks to differentiate between true knowledge removal and mere output suppression.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

TL;DR: ELFuzz 是一种基于大语言模型驱动的模糊测试方法，能够自动生成高效的模糊测试工具，适用于大规模现实系统，并显著提高覆盖率和漏洞检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于生成的模糊测试方法需要大量手动构建输入规范和语义约束，过程繁琐且效率低下。

Method: ELFuzz 利用大语言模型驱动的进化机制，在覆盖范围指导下，从最小种子模糊器开始，自动合成适合被测系统的高效模糊器。

Result: 相比现有方法，ELFuzz 提高了多达 434.8% 的覆盖率，并触发了更多人工注入的漏洞；在实际应用中，发现了五个 0-day 漏洞；消融研究表明其核心组件贡献了大部分效果提升。

Conclusion: ELFuzz 展现了自动化、高效和可扩展的输入生成潜力，为模糊测试领域带来了新的突破。

Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to
specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and
software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to
construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large
Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based
fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over
fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels
the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.
Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of
real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)
synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and
semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared
ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized
by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more
coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also
used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of
cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are
exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the
fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to
62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers
synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical
structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results
present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and
extensible input generation for fuzzing.

TL;DR: This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV), analyzes the likelihood and impact of attacks, and proposes mitigation strategies. It also identifies research gaps that need further investigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid growth of UAS and UAV in various fields, there is an increasing need to examine security vulnerabilities in these systems.

Method: The authors summarize the cybersecurity vulnerabilities in different phases of UAV deployment, analyze the likelihood and impact of each vulnerability's occurrence, and review applicable mitigation strategies. They also present relevant cybersecurity standards and their recommendations in the UAS context.

Result: The analysis reveals several critical research gaps in UAS security that require further investigation, despite significant existing literature on the topic.

Conclusion: Enhancing UAS security requires both UAS-specific and non-UAS-specific mitigation strategies. The authors recommend future research directions to address identified gaps.

Abstract: In the last decade, the rapid growth of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and
Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) in communication, defense, and transportation
has increased. The application of UAS will continue to increase rapidly. This
has led researchers to examine security vulnerabilities in various facets of
UAS infrastructure and UAVs, which form a part of the UAS system to reinforce
these critical systems. This survey summarizes the cybersecurity
vulnerabilities in several phases of UAV deployment, the likelihood of each
vulnerability's occurrence, the impact of attacks, and mitigation strategies
that could be applied. We go beyond the state-of-the-art by taking a
comprehensive approach to enhancing UAS security by performing an analysis of
both UAS-specific and non-UAS-specific mitigation strategies that are
applicable within the UAS domain to define the lessons learned. We also present
relevant cybersecurity standards and their recommendations in the UAS context.
Despite the significant literature in UAS security and the relevance of
cyberphysical and networked systems security approaches from the past, which we
identify in the survey, we find several critical research gaps that require
further investigation. These form part of our discussions and recommendations
for the future exploration by our research community.

### [136] [Adaptive Chosen-Ciphertext Security of Distributed Broadcast Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10338)
*Kwangsu Lee*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: An efficient Distributed Broadcast Encryption (DBE) scheme with adaptive CCA security is proposed, featuring constant size ciphertexts and private keys, linear size public keys, and requiring only a constant number of pairing operations for public key verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous DBE schemes were proven secure under the adaptive chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) model but required a linear number of pairing operations when verifying user public keys. There was a need for an efficient DBE scheme with stronger security guarantees, such as adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security.

Method: The authors first propose a semi-static CCA secure DBE scheme and prove its security under the $q$-Type assumption. They then modify the generic transformation of Gentry and Waters to convert this semi-static CCA secure DBE scheme into an adaptive CCA secure DBE scheme. This new scheme has constant size ciphertexts and private keys, linear size public keys, and requires only a constant number of pairing operations for public key verification.

Result: The proposed DBE scheme achieves adaptive CCA security for the first time and is more efficient compared to previous schemes, with constant size ciphertexts and private keys, linear size public keys, and reduced pairing operations during public key verification.

Conclusion: The authors successfully constructed an efficient DBE scheme that is adaptively CCA secure, overcoming limitations of prior schemes in terms of both security and efficiency.

Abstract: Distributed broadcast encryption (DBE) is a specific kind of broadcast
encryption (BE) where users independently generate their own public and private
keys, and a sender can efficiently create a ciphertext for a subset of users by
using the public keys of the subset users. Previously proposed DBE schemes have
been proven in the adaptive chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security model and
have the disadvantage of requiring linear number of pairing operations when
verifying the public key of a user. In this paper, we propose an efficient DBE
scheme in bilinear groups and prove adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA)
security for the first time. To do this, we first propose a semi-static CCA
secure DBE scheme and prove the security under the $q$-Type assumption. Then,
by modifying the generic transformation of Gentry and Waters that converts a
semi-static CPA secure DBE scheme into an adaptive CPA secure DBE scheme to be
applied to CCA secure DBE schemes, we propose an adaptive CCA secure DBE scheme
and prove its adaptive CCA security. Our proposed DBE scheme is efficient
because it requires constant size ciphertexts, constant size private keys, and
linear size public keys, and the public key verification requires only a
constant number of pairing operations and efficient group membership checks.

TL;DR: FicGCN is a HE-based framework designed to exploit the sparse characteristics of GCNs and balance aggregation and combination operations, achieving up to 4.10x improvement over the latest design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy concerns in cloud-based GCN services and reduce the computational overhead introduced by Homomorphic Encryption (HE) while leveraging the sparsity of GCNs.

Method: Propose FicGCN with a latency-aware packing scheme, Sparse Intra-Ciphertext Aggregation (SpIntra-CA) method, and region-based data reordering driven by local adjacency structure.

Result: FicGCN achieved the best performance across all tested datasets, with up to a 4.10x improvement over the latest design.

Conclusion: FicGCN effectively exploits the sparse characteristics of GCNs and balances aggregation and combination operations, significantly improving performance.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) have gained widespread popularity
in various fields like personal healthcare and financial systems, due to their
remarkable performance. Despite the growing demand for cloud-based GCN
services, privacy concerns over sensitive graph data remain significant.
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) facilitates Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
(PPML) by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data. However, HE
introduces substantial computational overhead, particularly for GCN operations
that require rotations and multiplications in matrix products. The sparsity of
GCNs offers significant performance potential, but their irregularity
introduces additional operations that reduce practical gains. In this paper, we
propose FicGCN, a HE-based framework specifically designed to harness the
sparse characteristics of GCNs and strike a globally optimal balance between
aggregation and combination operations. FicGCN employs a latency-aware packing
scheme, a Sparse Intra-Ciphertext Aggregation (SpIntra-CA) method to minimize
rotation overhead, and a region-based data reordering driven by local adjacency
structure. We evaluated FicGCN on several popular datasets, and the results
show that FicGCN achieved the best performance across all tested datasets, with
up to a 4.10x improvement over the latest design.

### [138] [SOFT: Selective Data Obfuscation for Protecting LLM Fine-tuning against Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10424)
*Kaiyuan Zhang,Siyuan Cheng,Hanxi Guo,Yuetian Chen,Zian Su,Shengwei An,Yuntao Du,Charles Fleming,Ashish Kundu,Xiangyu Zhang,Ninghui Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs) due to loss reduction during fine-tuning, which can expose private information. To address this, the paper introduces SOFT, a defense method that uses influential data selection to balance utility and privacy in LLM fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models often involves private or sensitive information, leading to significant privacy concerns. There is a need for effective methods to protect such information while maintaining model performance.

Method: The authors propose SOFT (Selective data Obfuscation in LLM Fine-Tuning), which uses influential data selection with an adjustable parameter to balance between preserving utility and protecting privacy. This technique aims to mitigate privacy leakage during the fine-tuning process of LLMs.

Result: Extensive experiments across six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining competitive model performance.

Conclusion: SOFT offers a practical and scalable solution to safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs, addressing the vulnerability to membership inference attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in LLMs show potential for novel applications. This paper explores the specification and evaluation of multi-agent LLM systems through a system architecture and prototype extended from previous research, with test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicating feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential and suitability of LLM-based multi-agent approaches for specific applications beyond text generation by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution.

Method: The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks are used to evaluate the architecture and approach.

Result: Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. The results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Conclusion: The paper reports the results of exploratory research to specify and evaluate aspects of multi-agent LLM systems through a multi-agent system, demonstrating feasibility in cybersecurity tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

### [140] [A Crack in the Bark: Leveraging Public Knowledge to Remove Tree-Ring Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10502)
*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new attack on the Tree-Ring watermarking technique for diffusion models, which only needs access to the variational autoencoder used in training. This method significantly reduces the Tree-Ring detector's effectiveness while maintaining high image quality, surpassing existing attacks that require full model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the vulnerability of Tree-Ring watermarking technique when only variational autoencoder is accessible to attackers and highlight risks associated with using public autoencoders in training diffusion models.

Method: By accessing the variational autoencoder from the target diffusion model training process, attackers approximate the model's intermediate latent space to conduct more effective surrogate-based attacks against Tree-Ring watermarking.

Result: This approach dramatically reduced the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves (from 0.993 to 0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385 respectively), outperforming methods requiring full model access, while preserving high image quality.

Conclusion: Reusing public autoencoders for training diffusion models poses significant security risks as shown by this novel attack. Also, Tree-Ring detector's precision may not meet real-world deployment standards.

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

*Xunguang Wang,Zhenlan Ji,Wenxuan Wang,Zongjie Li,Daoyuan Wu,Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）的越狱防护措施存在碎片化问题，缺乏统一分类和评估框架。本文提出一个多维度分类法和评估框架，分析现有防护措施的优缺点，并提供优化建议。代码已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM取得了显著进展，但其部署暴露出关键漏洞，特别是对绕过安全机制的越狱攻击。目前针对LLM的防护措施（guardrails）虽有发展，但尚未形成系统化的知识体系。

Method: 提出一种新的多维度分类方法，将防护措施按六个关键维度分类，并引入安全性-效率-实用性评估框架来衡量其实用效果。通过广泛分析和实验识别现有防护方法的优势与局限性。

Result: 明确了现有防护措施在不同攻击类型中的适用性和局限性，提供了关于如何优化防护组合的见解，为未来的研发提供了结构化的基础。

Conclusion: 本文的工作为未来的研究和发展提供了指导原则，推动了强大且稳健的LLM防护措施的设计和部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

### [142] [Assessing the Resilience of Automotive Intrusion Detection Systems to Adversarial Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10620)
*Stefano Longari,Paolo Cerracchio,Michele Carminati,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究扩展了我们之前的工作，探讨了基于梯度的对抗性攻击在不同知识程度下对汽车入侵检测系统（IDS）的影响。通过在公开数据集上评估这些攻击对先进IDS的有效性，并分析对抗性扰动和实时可行性的影响，结果表明攻击效果依赖于数据集质量、目标IDS及攻击者的知识水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代车辆中的控制器局域网（CAN）总线缺乏强大的安全措施，加上车辆连通性的增加，使得车辆容易受到网络攻击。现有的入侵检测系统（IDSs）并非无懈可击，特别是面对对抗性攻击时可能被绕过。因此，研究对抗性攻击在汽车环境下的可行性和影响具有重要意义。

Method: 研究考虑了三种攻击场景：白盒（攻击者拥有完全系统知识）、灰盒（部分系统知识）和更现实的黑盒（无关于IDS内部运作或数据的知识）。通过使用两个公开可用的数据集，评估了这些攻击对先进IDS的有效性。此外，还研究了对抗性扰动对攻击效果的影响，并通过预计算逃逸负载来评估实时可行性。

Result: 研究表明，在汽车领域中进行有效的对抗性攻击是具有挑战性的。攻击的效果很大程度上取决于数据集的质量、目标IDS的特性以及攻击者所掌握的知识程度。

Conclusion: 尽管在汽车环境中实施对抗性攻击面临挑战，但其效果与多个因素相关，包括数据集质量、目标IDS及攻击者的知识水平。这强调了提高IDS鲁棒性和理解潜在威胁的重要性。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

*Stefano Longari,Alessandro Pozone,Jessica Leoni,Mario Polino,Michele Carminati,Mara Tanelli,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: In this paper, a new architecture called CyFence is proposed to enhance the resilience of closed-loop control systems in Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) against cyber-attacks by incorporating a secure semantic check.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper lies in the fact that while Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) have greatly evolved and become more connected, they are also increasingly exposed to cyber-attacks. Current defense strategies rarely exploit the unique cyber-physical nature of these systems.

Method: The authors propose CyFence, a novel architecture which improves the resilience of closed-loop control systems against cyber-attacks through the addition of a semantic check. This check confirms that the system behaves as expected. The security of the semantic check code is ensured using the Trusted Execution Environment provided by modern processors.

Result: CyFence was evaluated on a real-world application - an active braking digital controller. It was demonstrated to effectively mitigate various types of attacks with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: CyFence successfully exploits the cyber-physical nature of CPSs, enhancing their resilience against cyber-attacks while maintaining low computational overhead.

Abstract: In the last decades, Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) have experienced a
significant technological evolution and increased connectivity, at the cost of
greater exposure to cyber-attacks. Since many CPS are used in safety-critical
systems, such attacks entail high risks and potential safety harms. Although
several defense strategies have been proposed, they rarely exploit the
cyber-physical nature of the system. In this work, we exploit the nature of CPS
by proposing CyFence, a novel architecture that improves the resilience of
closed-loop control systems against cyber-attacks by adding a semantic check,
used to confirm that the system is behaving as expected. To ensure the security
of the semantic check code, we use the Trusted Execution Environment
implemented by modern processors. We evaluate CyFence considering a real-world
application, consisting of an active braking digital controller, demonstrating
that it can mitigate different types of attacks with a negligible computation
overhead.

*Aakanksha Saha,Martina Lindorfer,Juan Caballero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现，行为特征可能无法完全替代IOCs进行威胁归因，因为即使整合多个数据源并添加额外信息后，仍有64%的威胁组织缺乏特定于该组织的行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于IOCs易变性大且生命周期短，网络安全领域逐渐向更持久的行为特征（如TTPs和软件）转移，但这些行为特征的独特性和完整性尚未被深入探讨。

Method: 1. 系统分析来自MITRE ATT&CK和Malpedia的威胁组织行为特征。
2. 探究有多少威胁组织具有特定于该组织的行为。
3. 评估结合两个数据源后的行为特征改进情况。
4. 添加被利用的漏洞和从更多威胁报告中提取的技术以增强行为特征。

Result: 1. 在ATT&CK中，只有34%的威胁组织有特定技术，而73%使用特定软件；但在Malpedia数据集中，这一比例降至24%。
2. 结合两个数据源后，覆盖率有所提高，但具有特定行为的组织比例仍低于30%。
3. 即使添加额外信息，仍有64%的组织没有任何特定行为。

Conclusion: 尽管行为特征比IOCs更持久，但其独特性和完整性不足以完全取代IOCs在威胁归因中的作用。

Abstract: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domain
names are commonly used for threat detection and attribution. However, IOCs
tend to be short-lived as they are easy to change. As a result, the
cybersecurity community is shifting focus towards more persistent behavioral
profiles, such as the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and the
software used by a threat group. However, the distinctiveness and completeness
of such behavioral profiles remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
systematically analyze threat group profiles built from two open cyber threat
intelligence (CTI) knowledge bases: MITRE ATT&CK and Malpedia. We first
investigate what fraction of threat groups have group-specific behaviors, i.e.,
behaviors used exclusively by a single group. We find that only 34% of threat
groups in ATT&CK have group-specific techniques. The software used by a threat
group proves to be more distinctive, with 73% of ATT&CK groups using
group-specific software. However, this percentage drops to 24% in the broader
Malpedia dataset. Next, we evaluate how group profiles improve when data from
both sources are combined. While coverage improves modestly, the proportion of
groups with group-specific behaviors remains under 30%. We then enhance
profiles by adding exploited vulnerabilities and additional techniques
extracted from more threat reports. Despite the additional information, 64% of
groups still lack any group-specific behavior. Our findings raise concerns on
the belief that behavioral profiles can replace IOCs in threat group
attribution.

*Davide Maffiola,Stefano Longari,Michele Carminati,Mara Tanelli,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes GOLIATH, a blockchain-based decentralized framework running on the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system to collect real-time traffic information. It ensures trusted data exchange, exploits the distributed nature of vehicles, and uses a novel consensus mechanism resilient to adversaries. The framework's robustness and safety are evaluated in a simulated environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) require vehicles to exchange real-time data, traditionally collected via on-site sensors. Crowd-sourcing from onboard sensors or smartphones has become an alternative but follows a centralized model with single points of failure and trust issues.

Method: GOLIATH is a blockchain-based decentralized framework that runs on IVI systems. Vehicles share their positions and neighbors' as transactions on a ledger using a novel consensus mechanism designed to resist tampering and communication disabling by adversaries.

Result: Evaluated in a realistic simulated environment considering various threats, the proposed framework demonstrates robustness and safety properties.

Conclusion: GOLIATH mitigates limitations of centralized crowd-sourcing solutions for traffic information management by ensuring trusted collection and exchange of information.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) technology has advanced during the
past years, and it is now used for several applications that require vehicles
to exchange real-time data, such as in traffic information management.
Traditionally, road traffic information has been collected using on-site
sensors. However, crowd-sourcing traffic information from onboard sensors or
smartphones has become a viable alternative. State-of-the-art solutions
currently follow a centralized model where only the service provider has
complete access to the collected traffic data and represent a single point of
failure and trust. In this paper, we propose GOLIATH, a blockchain-based
decentralized framework that runs on the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system
to collect real-time information exchanged between the network's participants.
Our approach mitigates the limitations of existing crowd-sourcing centralized
solutions by guaranteeing trusted information collection and exchange, fully
exploiting the intrinsic distributed nature of vehicles. We demonstrate its
feasibility in the context of vehicle positioning and traffic information
management. Each vehicle participating in the decentralized network shares its
position and neighbors' ones in the form of a transaction recorded on the
ledger, which uses a novel consensus mechanism to validate it. We design the
consensus mechanism resilient against a realistic set of adversaries that aim
to tamper or disable the communication. We evaluate the proposed framework in a
simulated (but realistic) environment, which considers different threats and
allows showing its robustness and safety properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the interrelation between Commitment Schemes and Multi-Party Computation protocols, which has been underexplored despite extensive study of each in isolation.

Method: Analyzing different types of Commitment Schemes, their contributions to various MPC constructions, and their relation to real-life applications of MPC.

Result: Findings emphasize the importance of carefully selecting Commitment Schemes to meet adversarial and functional requirements of MPC, leading to more robust and privacy-preserving cryptographic applications.

Conclusion: Understanding the cryptographic interplay between Commitment Schemes and MPC is crucial for developing secure and efficient protocols, accessible to both researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: The paper presents an analysis of Commitment Schemes (CSs) used in
Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols. While the individual properties of CSs
and the guarantees offered by MPC have been widely studied in isolation, their
interrelation in concrete protocols and applications remains mostly
underexplored. This paper presents the relation between the two, with an
emphasis on (security) properties and their impact on the upper layer MPC. In
particular, we investigate how different types of CSs contribute to various MPC
constructions and their relation to real-life applications of MPC. The paper
can also serve as a tutorial for understanding the cryptographic interplay
between CS and MPC, making it accessible to both researchers and practitioners.
Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully selecting CS to meet the

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where attackers implant hidden triggers during training. TED-LaST is a novel defense strategy that enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks by introducing label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) methods for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs can be vulnerable to adaptive attacks that distort topological representation distributions across network layers.

Method: TED-LaST introduces two key innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis. These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade traditional TED-based defenses.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch, and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack.

Conclusion: TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against evolving threats.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against

*Xiaobei Yan,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Bit-flip attacks (BFAs) are a serious threat to DNNs. Existing defenses are not effective in all scenarios. This paper proposes ObfusBFA, which introduces random dummy operations during model inference to transform delicate attacks into random bit flips. ObfusBFA is evaluated against different types of attacks and shows consistent model accuracy preservation and significant reduction in attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BFAs can significantly degrade the model accuracy or mislead the model prediction. Existing defenses lack effectiveness for all scenarios.

Method: ObfusBFA introduces random dummy operations during the model inference, transforming delicate attacks into random bit flips. Novel algorithms are designed to identify critical bits and insert obfuscation operations.

Result: ObfusBFA consistently preserves model accuracy across various datasets and DNN architectures while significantly reducing the attack success rates. It introduces minimal latency and storage overhead.

Conclusion: ObfusBFA is an efficient and holistic methodology to mitigate BFAs targeting both high-level model weights and low-level codebase.

Abstract: Bit-flip attacks (BFAs) represent a serious threat to Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs), where flipping a small number of bits in the model parameters or binary
code can significantly degrade the model accuracy or mislead the model
prediction in a desired way. Existing defenses exclusively focus on protecting
models for specific attacks and platforms, while lacking effectiveness for
other scenarios. We propose ObfusBFA, an efficient and holistic methodology to
mitigate BFAs targeting both the high-level model weights and low-level
codebase (executables or shared libraries). The key idea of ObfusBFA is to
introduce random dummy operations during the model inference, which effectively
transforms the delicate attacks into random bit flips, making it much harder
for attackers to pinpoint and exploit vulnerable bits. We design novel
algorithms to identify critical bits and insert obfuscation operations. We
evaluate ObfusBFA against different types of attacks, including the adaptive
scenarios where the attacker increases the flip bit budget to attempt to
circumvent our defense. The results show that ObfusBFA can consistently
preserve the model accuracy across various datasets and DNN architectures while
significantly reducing the attack success rates. Additionally, it introduces
minimal latency and storage overhead, making it a practical solution for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Analyze the abstract of a paper introducing Belshazaar, a framework addressing effective permission set problems and wildcard permission spread in Azure RBAC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issues caused by wildcard permissions in Azure RBAC that obscure allowed operations and undermine least-privilege guarantees.

Method: Belshazaar uses a two-stage framework: formalizing Azure action syntax via a context-free grammar and compiling wildcards into explicit action sets, and defining an ultrametric diameter metric to quantify overreach in wildcard scenarios.

Result: Belshazaar reveals 39 percent of actions admit cross Resource Provider reach with non-obvious wildcards and shows effective permission sets are computable.

Conclusion: Wildcard patterns can cause significant privilege bloat, and Belshazaar offers a scalable approach for tighter RBAC policies.

Abstract: Azure RBAC leverages wildcard permissions to simplify policy authoring, but
this abstraction often obscures the actual set of allowed operations and
undermines least-privilege guarantees. We introduce Belshazaar, a two-stage
framework that targets both the effective permission set problem and the
evaluation of wildcards permissions spread. First, we formalize Azure action
syntax via a context free grammar and implement a compiler that expands any
wildcard into its explicit action set. Second, we define an ultrametric
diameter metric to quantify semantic overreach in wildcard scenarios. Applied
to Microsoft s official catalog of 15481 actions, Belshazaar reveals that about
39 percent of actions admit a cross Resource Provider reach when associated
with non obvious wildcards, and that effective permissions sets are effectively
computable. These findings demonstrate that wildcard patterns can introduce
substantial privilege bloat, and that our approach offers a scalable, semantics
driven path toward tighter, least-privilege RBAC policies in Azure
environments.

### [150] [ME: Trigger Element Combination Backdoor Attack on Copyright Infringement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10776)
*Feiyu Yang,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of copyright infringement attacks on generative diffusion models, particularly focusing on enhancing the SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) method. It introduces new datasets and a Multi-Element (ME) attack approach that improves attack effectiveness while maintaining stealthiness through Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Experimental results show improvements over SBD in terms of Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) and First Attack Epoch (FAE), especially under low subsampling ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the limited feasible data resources for researching copyright infringement attacks on generative diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. Existing datasets either have copyright issues or inappropriate content, and current methods like SBD perform poorly when few poisoning samples are available.

Method: The authors created new datasets for research in attacks similar to SBD. They proposed a Multi-Element (ME) attack method which increases the number of poisonous visual-text elements per sample and incorporates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to maintain stealthiness.

Result: On two new datasets, the Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch (FAE) were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60, respectively, matching or surpassing benchmark datasets. Under low subsampling conditions (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI and DCT achieved CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, outperforming original SBD.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that using ME combined with DCT can effectively enhance the attack capability on generative diffusion models while maintaining stealthiness, even with limited poisoning samples.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

TL;DR: 当前的大型语言模型（LLM）安全防御在分解攻击面前失效，这种攻击将恶意目标分解为看似无害的子任务以规避拒绝。问题出在现有的浅层安全对齐技术上：它们仅检测直接提示中的危害，无法推理长期意图，因此对在一系列看似良性的指令中逐渐显现的恶意意图视而不见。为应对这一挑战，我们提出增加一个外部监控器，以更高的粒度观察对话。为此，我们整理了迄今为止最大、最多样化的数据集，包括问答、文本到图像和代理任务。通过对前沿LLM进行测试，我们的数据显示，在GPT-4o上平均有87%的攻击成功率，这表明分解攻击广泛有效。此外，我们发现随机任务可以注入分解的子任务中，进一步掩盖恶意意图。为了实时防御，我们提出了一个轻量级的顺序监控框架，累积评估每个子任务。结果表明，经过精心设计提示的轻量级监控器实现了93%的防御成功率，优于如o3 mini等作为监控器的推理模型。此外，它对随机任务注入保持稳健，同时将成本降低90%，延迟减少50%。我们的研究结果表明，轻量级顺序监控器在缓解分解攻击方面非常有效，并且适合部署。

Conclusion: 轻量级顺序监控器在缓解分解攻击方面表现出色，具有高效率和低成本，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

*Yuliang Zhu,Jing Cheng,Qi Xie,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Qingyong Zhu,Yuanyuan Liu,Xin Liu,Jianfeng Ren,Chengbo Wang,Dong Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DUN-SRE, a deep unrolling network with spatiotemporal rotation equivariance for dynamic MRI reconstruction, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic MRI exhibits transformation symmetries such as spatial rotation symmetry and temporal symmetry. Leveraging these symmetries can improve image quality, especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios.

Method: DUN-SRE integrates data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified deep unrolling framework with (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture to establish spatiotemporal equivariance. It also includes a high-fidelity group filter parameterization mechanism.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets show that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving rotation-symmetric structures and has strong generalization capability.

Conclusion: DUN-SRE is effective in modeling spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints, leading to more physically accurate cardiac motion dynamics in cine MRI.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: SWDL-Net achieves superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based

intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged

Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference

performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific

### [155] [SNR and Resource Adaptive Deep JSCC for Distributed IoT Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10699)
*Ali Waqas,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless image classification is proposed, which uses LAIGA to optimize network configuration. It outperforms existing methods, especially under low SNR and limited computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing split-network DNN based JSCC schemes for IoT devices lack adaptability to varying computational budgets and channel conditions due to fixed network splits and static configurations.

Method: The method involves proposing a SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework and introducing LAIGA, which efficiently explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under given FLOPs constraints and SNR, while discarding infeasible network configurations and benefiting from Random Forests based learning assistance.

Result: Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures and existing SNR-adaptive methods, achieving a 10% increase in classification accuracy compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M FLOPs) at IoT device.

Conclusion: The proposed SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework with LAIGA offers superior performance for wireless image classification across IoT devices and edge servers, particularly under challenging conditions.

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

*Dipanshu Panda,Jayden Koshy Joe,Harshith M R,Swathi Narashiman,Pranay Mathur,Anish Veerakumar,Aniruddh Krishna,Keerthiharan A*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for fine-grained control over music generation using MusicGen, allowing timbre and style transfer, and genre fusion through inference-time interventions. This is achieved by steering the residual stream or attention layer activations with weights from linear probes trained on them. Modelling this as a regression task improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable more precise control over music generation in terms of timbre, style, and genre while leveraging the global conditioning capabilities of MusicGen.

Method: Using an autoregressive generative music transformer called MusicGen, the method involves inference-time interventions to steer the residual stream with weights of linear probes trained on it or by steering the attention layer activations similarly. The task is modeled as a regression task for improved performance.

Result: This approach allows for timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion in music generation with both global and local control.

Conclusion: The introduced method successfully provides fine-grained control over music generation through MusicGen, combining global conditioning from text prompts with local control via intervention techniques.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores how to improve audio-LLM interaction by modifying architectural design choices, leading to a final architecture that achieves significant improvements over the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid progress in application-focused developments of Audio-LLMs, the underlying mechanisms for efficient transfer of rich semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored.

Method: Starting with a standard audio-LLM architecture, the authors propose and evaluate several modifications based on hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles. These include delaying audio integration, using only the attention submodule for probing audio representations, and integrating an ensemble of diverse audio encoders.

Result: Experiments show that each modification leads to improvements: delaying audio integration enhances textual context, attention submodule alone can proficiently probe audio representations, and an ensemble of audio encoders broadens the LLM's capacity. The final architecture incorporating all modifications achieves relative improvements from 10% to 60% over the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed modifications to the audio-LLM architecture lead to significant improvements in cross-modal information transfer, validating the approach taken in this study.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Motivation: 受到跨模态生成的最新进展的启发，研究者们试图寻找一种新的声学掩蔽方法，用以减少环境噪音的干扰，同时避免传统掩蔽方法中因声音与噪音不匹配而导致的音量过度增加问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为Blending Noises into Personalized Music（BNMusic）的框架，包含两个关键阶段：第一阶段是根据噪音特征合成完整的音乐片段（以mel-spectrogram形式表示）；第二阶段是自适应地放大生成的音乐片段，以进一步降低噪音感知，同时保持听觉质量。

Result: 在MusicBench、EPIC-SOUNDS和ESC-50数据集上的实验结果表明，该框架能够有效地将环境噪音与节奏对齐、自适应放大的愉悦音乐片段融合，从而最小化噪音的显著性，提升整体听觉体验。

Conclusion: BNMusic框架提供了一种有效的替代传统声学掩蔽的方法，通过生成个性化的音乐来减少环境噪音的干扰，为改善听觉体验提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model for Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA). AVD synthesizes accident video clips by generating causal parts in dashcam videos and can be trained without extra annotations. Additionally, AVD enables Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with a triple loss function. Experiments show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TAA approaches treat the problem as a supervised learning task requiring laborious annotations, but traffic scenes are long-tailed, uncertain, and fast-evolving, making it difficult to identify real causal parts of accidents and leading to data bias and background confounding issues.

Method: The proposed AVD model generates causal video frames based on accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving frame style and content. It can be trained using datasets from various driving scenes without additional annotations. The model also facilitates EQ-TAA with an equivariant triple loss for anchor accident-free video clips and contrastive pseudo-normal/accident clips.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVD and EQ-TAA achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in TAA.

Conclusion: The AVD model successfully synthesizes accident video clips for TAA without needing extra annotations, addressing the challenges posed by the inherent nature of traffic scenes.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

### [163] [HER2 Expression Prediction with Flexible Multi-Modal Inputs via Dynamic Bidirectional Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10006)
*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer have limitations. This study proposes an adaptive bimodal framework with three innovations that significantly improves prediction accuracy and reliability, reduces costs, and performs well even with incomplete data. It has great potential to improve HER2 assessment in various healthcare settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of current HER2 assessment models which analyze H&E or IHC images separately, while clinical practice relies on their synergistic interpretation. The concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints.

Method: The method involves proposing an adaptive bimodal framework with three key components: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization.

Result: This architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25%, achieves 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, and maintains 90.28% reliability with sole IHC inputs. It confirms 22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, and cross-modal reconstruction enhances F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251 (IHC to HE).

Conclusion: The proposed framework's 'dual-preferred, single-compatible' design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring synchronized acquisition, benefiting resource-limited settings through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. It mitigates performance degradation from missing data while preserving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper presents a diffusion-based framework for controllable expressive 3D facial animation, which introduces a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy and an attention-based latent diffusion model. This approach addresses the challenges of single-modal control signals and deterministic regression-based mapping in audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address two significant challenges in audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation: reliance on single-modal control signals without leveraging their complementary strengths for comprehensive emotion manipulation, and deterministic regression-based mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations.

Method: The method presented in this paper includes two key innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and (2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches across most metrics, achieving a 21.6% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving physiologically plausible facial dynamics.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper presents a successful diffusion-based framework for controllable expressive 3D facial animation, overcoming the limitations of previous methods by utilizing multimodal emotion binding and attention-based latent diffusion modeling.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based

non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining

Conclusion: This work contributes a scalable foundation for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal reasoning in visual media.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel framework named Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition (WDMIR) which enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis of non-verbal information. It consists of a wavelet-driven fusion module and a cross-modal interaction mechanism. Experiments show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches to multimodal intent recognition prioritize text analysis, often overlooking the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues.

Method: The method involves two main components: 1) A wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain; 2) A cross-modal interaction mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to trimodal integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by 1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Conclusion: The WDMIR framework effectively bridges the semantic gap between verbal and non-verbal information and sets a new benchmark for multimodal intent recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to

### [168] [Multimodal Emotion Coupling via Speech-to-Facial and Bodily Gestures in Dyadic Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10010)
*Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela,Yukie Nagai*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了IEMOCAP语料库中双人互动的区域特定运动捕捉下的多模态情感耦合。通过将语音特征与3D面部和手部标记位移对齐，量化表达活跃性，并进行语音到手势预测。结果表明，在非重叠语音中，下脸部和嘴巴的活跃性更高；悲伤在非重叠时表现出更高的表达性，而愤怒在重叠时抑制手势。预测映射显示，在发音区域中，语调和MFCCs具有最高的准确性，而唤醒和效价的相关性较低且更具上下文敏感性。值得注意的是，低唤醒和重叠语音增强了手语同步性，但效价则不然。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类情感表达是通过协调的声音、面部和手势信号产生的。尽管语音面部对齐已经很成熟，但将情感丰富的语音与区域性面部和手部运动联系起来的更广泛动态仍然是深入了解真实互动中如何传达情感和行为线索的关键。会话交换结构（如顺序轮流发言）调节这种协调，创建多模态同步的稳定时间窗口，同时说话（通常表示高唤醒时刻）破坏这种对齐并影响情感清晰度。理解这些动态可以提高实时情感检测的准确性。

Method: 研究使用IEMOCAP语料库中的双人互动数据，采用区域特定运动捕捉来分析多模态情感耦合。语音特征包括低级语调、MFCCs以及模型衍生的唤醒、效价和分类情感（快乐、悲伤、愤怒、中立），并与3D面部和手部标记位移对齐。通过帧间位移幅度量化表达活跃性，并通过将语音特征映射到面部和手部运动来进行语音到手势预测。

Result: 非重叠语音引发了更大的活跃性，尤其是在下脸部和嘴巴。悲伤在非重叠时表现出更高的表达性，而愤怒在重叠时抑制手势。预测映射显示，在发音区域中，语调和MFCCs具有最高的准确性，而唤醒和效价的相关性较低且更具上下文敏感性。值得注意的是，低唤醒和重叠语音增强了手语同步性，但效价则不然。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态情感耦合的复杂动态，强调了非重叠和重叠语音对不同情感表达的影响。结果表明，语调和MFCCs在发音区域中具有较高的预测准确性，而唤醒和效价的相关性较低且更具上下文敏感性。此外，低唤醒和重叠语音增强了手语同步性，这对理解真实互动中的情感和行为线索有重要意义。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering

mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots
through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

Conclusion: The modular approach provides a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, with future improvements possible through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal

navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded
in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and
road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in
a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology
prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our
method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their
association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to
comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for safety validation by capturing joint probability distributions of scenario parameters effectively.

Method: Using Gaussian Mixture Copula Models which combine multimodal expressivity and copula flexibility, benchmarked against Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models using real-world driving data.

Result: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of likelihood and Sinkhorn distance across 18 million scenario instances.

Conclusion: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models are promising for future scenario-based validation frameworks for automated driving systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

TL;DR: This paper shows how autonomous learning from sparsely-labeled real-world data in industrial settings can improve robotic picking performance. It focuses on multi-suction robot picking and applies multi-modal visual encoders to predict the success of candidate picks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of robotic operation in real-world settings, such as warehouses, by autonomously learning from sparsely-labeled data.

Method: Utilizes multiple input modalities (RGB, depth, semantic segmentation) to estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained using a combination of multimodal pretrain and finetune from real-world item picking data.

Result: The experimental evaluation demonstrates improved performance for different item configurations, pick scenes, and object types. Ablations reveal the importance of training over multiple modalities and the ability to use only a subset during finetuning and inference.

Conclusion: Autonomous learning from sparsely-labeled real-world data can lead to improved robotic picking performance, especially when utilizing multi-modal visual encoders.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework for UAVs to perform language-guided flight using continuous velocity commands derived from egocentric camera observations, overcoming challenges of generalization and fixed action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottlenecks in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) such as generalizing to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces.

Method: VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on LLM that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by VLM that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control.

Result: VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Real-world VLN tasks demonstrate robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even with abstract language input.

Conclusion: VLFly successfully addresses key challenges in VLN for UAVs by providing continuous velocity commands purely from egocentric observations captured by a monocular camera.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

### [176] [Data-Driven Prediction of Dynamic Interactions Between Robot Appendage and Granular Material](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10875)
*Guanjin Wang,Xiangxue Zhao,Shapour Azarm,Balakumar Balachandran*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed to understand robot motion interaction with granular terrain. It integrates dimension reduction, surrogate modeling and data assimilation techniques. This approach significantly reduces computational time compared to high-fidelity simulations, provides comparable accuracy using only simulation data as input, and has the potential to outperform high-fidelity simulations for long-horizon predictions when both simulation data and sparse physical experimental measurements are used as input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular terrain at certain length scales and reduce the computational time required by physics-based high-fidelity simulations.

Method: The method involves an integration of dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). It uses offline data including high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data.

Result: This approach can significantly reduce computational time compared to high-fidelity simulations while providing comparable accuracy. It also has the potential to outperform high-fidelity simulations in long-horizon predictions when combining simulation data and sparse physical experimental measurements. Additionally, it can reproduce the scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum resistive forces.

Conclusion: The data-driven modeling approach not only reduces computational time but also maintains prediction accuracy. It has the potential to enhance robot navigation and exploration capabilities in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline phases.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何利用语言模型的底层表示，以成本效益高的方式激发其强大的推理能力。

Method: 首先训练一个稀疏自动编码器（SAE）来捕捉源模型的推理能力，然后用训练好的SAE指导目标模型的标准监督微调过程，从而在不使用任何推理痕迹的情况下，仅使用经过验证的问题-答案数据来激发推理能力。

Result: SAE-Tuning方法在保留>97%推理性能的同时，将训练成本降低了>2000倍至约1美元，训练时间减少了>450倍至约20分钟；应用于轻微RL训练模型时，可实现如AIME24的43.33% Pass@1和AMC23的90% Pass@1的成绩，额外成本仅约1美元。此外，通过SAEs提取的推理能力具有泛化性和模块化特点。

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning方法不仅高效降低成本和时间，还能保持高水平的推理性能，并且提取的能力具有泛化性和模块化特性，为未来的研究和应用提供了广阔的空间。

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,

review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resources for harmful content detection are mainly focused on English, with limited availability for Chinese datasets.

Method: The authors created a professionally annotated benchmark covering six categories of Chinese harmful content and developed a knowledge rule base from the annotation process. They also proposed a knowledge-augmented baseline model that combines human-annotated knowledge rules with implicit knowledge from large language models.

Result: The knowledge-augmented baseline enables smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection.

Conclusion: The paper provides a valuable resource for Chinese harmful content detection and demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating explicit expert knowledge with LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and

TL;DR: The paper explores semantic degeneracy in natural language using Kolmogorov complexity, conducts a Bell inequality test with LLMs, and suggests Bayesian approaches for better linguistic interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) due to semantic degeneracy in natural language and propose alternative methods for interpreting linguistic meaning.

Method: Used Kolmogorov complexity to analyze semantic degeneracy and conducted a semantic Bell inequality test with diverse LLM agents as 'computational cognitive systems' to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings.

Result: Found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs significantly violating the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$), demonstrating non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation.

Conclusion: Classical frequentist-based approaches for natural language are lossy; Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

TL;DR: An unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), is introduced to fine-tune pretrained language models without external supervision. It matches or outperforms human-supervised training in various tasks and can improve frontier LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: For pretrained language models with superhuman capabilities, it's challenging to obtain high-quality human supervision for downstream tasks. Current post-training paradigms rely on humans to specify desired behaviors, which may not be feasible for advanced models.

Method: The paper introduces Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), an unsupervised algorithm that fine-tunes pretrained language models using their own generated labels, eliminating the need for external supervision.

Result: ICM matches the performance of golden supervision and outperforms crowdsourced human supervision on GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks. It also elicits superhuman capabilities better than human labels and improves the training of frontier LMs such as a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant.

Conclusion: Internal Coherence Maximization provides a promising approach to fine-tune language models without external supervision, particularly beneficial for models with superhuman capabilities.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Result: A comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories was developed. This resource can be used or modified by researchers to address pertinent HC questions with their samples of corporate communications.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable resources for researching human capital management and disclosure, and opens up opportunities for future research in this area.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate

Motivation: To deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by addressing the limitations in automatic evaluation methods and subjectivity in manual evaluation.

Method: Using LLMs to solve narrative planning problems and presenting a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples.

Result: GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but struggle with character intentionality and dramatic conflict, requiring reinforcement learning for complex reasoning.

Conclusion: The results provide insights into the scale of stories LLMs can generate while maintaining quality, highlight problem solving behaviors, and discuss challenges for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often fail at simple strategic games despite excelling in complex math problems. A new benchmark, TTT-Bench, evaluates LRMs' reasoning abilities through Tic-Tac-Toe-style games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reasoning capabilities of LRMs beyond STEM-related tasks and assess their performance in basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduced TTT-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games to evaluate LRMs' reasoning abilities. Used a programmatic approach to generate verifiable two-player game problems.

Result: State-of-the-art LRMs that perform well on hard math problems often fail at the simple reasoning games in TTT-Bench. Models scored significantly lower on TTT-Bench compared to other benchmarks like MATH 500 and AIME 2024, struggling particularly with long-term strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: LRMs' reasoning abilities are not as strong in non-STEM, basic strategic reasoning tasks as they are in complex mathematical problems, highlighting the need for further development in diverse reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Result: The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically diverse, and free from social-media domain dominance. Experiments on binary and multi-label classification yielded strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets, demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries.

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech detection in low-resource settings.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority

*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper re-examines the assumption that language models have Bayesian brains and finds that under certain conditions, they can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making. This challenges previous methods for eliciting human-like priors and proposes a method to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic patterns in Gibbs sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models possess Bayesian brains and challenge the assumption that their decision-making is probabilistic similar to sampling from unknown distributions.

Method: Revisiting the assumption of language models having Bayesian brains by analyzing their decision-making patterns under various circumstances, including examining near-deterministic decision-making and proposing a method to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic patterns in Gibbs sampling.

Result: Language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making even with non-zero sampling temperature, challenging the sampling assumption and showing that without proper scrutiny, simulated Gibbs sampling can lead to false priors.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into understanding the decision-making of large language models and the need to scrutinize methods used to infer their priors.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

TL;DR: This paper proposes ClusterUCB, an efficient gradient-based data selection framework using clustering and a modified UCB algorithm to reduce computing consumption in fine-tuning large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based data influence approximation is effective but computationally expensive for selecting useful data samples in supervised fine-tuning of large language models.

Method: ClusterUCB performs clustering on the training data pool based on similar gradient features, frames inter-cluster data selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, and uses a modified UCB algorithm with historical data influence information to estimate cluster distributions and balance exploration and exploitation.

Result: Experimental results show that ClusterUCB achieves comparable results to original gradient-based methods while significantly reducing computing resources.

Conclusion: ClusterUCB offers an efficient alternative for data selection in fine-tuning large language models by combining clustering and a modified UCB algorithm.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Flick的新方法，用于解决低资源语言环境下的少量标签文本分类问题。该方法通过改进伪标签的质量，减少错误传播，提高预训练语言模型的微调效果。实验表明，Flick在14个不同数据集上表现出色，包括阿拉伯语、乌尔都语和塞茨瓦纳语等低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的半监督学习方法容易受到噪声伪标签的影响，而针对少量标签分类的方法要么适用于资源丰富的语言（如英语），要么结构复杂易过拟合。因此需要一种新方法来应对低资源语言中的少量标签分类问题。

Method: Flick方法通过引入伪标签精炼组件，从初始的广泛聚类中提取高置信度的伪标签，采用单聚类凝聚和自适应top-k选择机制，从而显著提高伪标签质量并减少错误传播。

Result: Flick在包含阿拉伯语、乌尔都语、塞茨瓦纳语等多种低资源语言在内的14个数据集上展现出优越性能和良好的适应性。

Conclusion: Flick为低资源语言环境下的少量标签文本分类提供了一种有效解决方案，其伪标签精炼策略显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

### [192] [PAG: Multi-Turn Reinforced LLM Self-Correction with Policy as Generative Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10406)
*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In this paper, researchers developed a new framework called Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG) which helps large language models (LLMs) to self-correct by switching between policy and verifier roles in a multi-turn reinforcement learning setting. This selective revision mechanism only revises answers when an error is detected, enhancing both reasoning and verification abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks, they face challenges in reliably verifying their own outputs. Current solutions involve separate verifier models or multi-stage training pipelines that affect scalability.

Method: The proposed method, PAG, operates within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning paradigm where the model alternates between policy and verifier roles. It includes a selective revision mechanism where the model revises its answer only after detecting an error through generative verification.

Result: Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks show that PAG improves both direct generation and self-correction accuracy as a policy, and outperforms self-consistency methods as a verifier.

Conclusion: PAG represents a significant advancement in empowering LLMs with enhanced reasoning and verification capabilities, offering a scalable solution for self-correction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

### [193] [Beyond Single-User Dialogue: Assessing Multi-User Dialogue State Tracking Capabilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10504)
*Sangmin Song,Juhwan Choi,JungMin Yun,YoungBin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the robustness of large language models (LLMs) in multi-user dialogue state tracking (DST), revealing their limitations and emphasizing the need for future improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well large language models can perform dialogue state tracking in more complex, real-world scenarios involving multiple users rather than just structured user-agent conversations.

Method: The study extends an existing DST dataset by adding utterances of a second user based on speech act theory, allowing for a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.

Result: LLMs showed a significant drop in performance when handling multi-user DST compared to single-user DST, indicating current limitations in managing multiple speakers.

Conclusion: Future research should focus on enhancing LLM capabilities for multi-user DST to develop more realistic and robust dialogue state tracking models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RRP framework which mines knowledge graphs to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities by generating high-quality reasoning paths. It combines semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information, includes a rethinking module for path refinement, and shows state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: LLMs often lack background knowledge and tend to hallucinate, making them struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on factual knowledge but still have difficulty solving complex questions.

Method: The RRP framework mines the knowledge graph combining the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. A rethinking module evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.

Result: Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods.

Conclusion: RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities in a plug-and-play manner, distilling effective guidance for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

*Thanh Thi Nguyen,Campbell Wilson,Janis Dalins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for detecting life-threatening language, comparing their performance with traditional methods and demonstrating LLMs' superiority in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting life-threatening language is crucial for protecting individuals in distress, promoting mental health, and preventing harm and loss of life.

Method: Fine-tune three open-source LLMs (Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2) using their 7B parameter variants on datasets constructed with class balance, imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Compare their performance with traditional methods like bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.

Conclusion: LLMs show great potential for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

### [199] [PREMISE: Scalable and Strategic Prompt Optimization for Efficient Mathematical Reasoning in Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10716)
*Ye Yu,Yaoning Yu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents PREMISE, a prompt-only framework that reduces reasoning overhead in large reasoning models without modifying model weights, achieving significant reductions in tokens and costs while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the verbosity and high costs of reasoning traces in large reasoning models when solving mathematical problems.

Method: PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. It optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search.

Result: On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500, PREMISE matches or exceeds baseline accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by up to 87.5% and cutting costs by 69-82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization via PREMISE is a practical and scalable approach for efficient large reasoning model inference without compromising reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a method using large language model (LLM) to correct named entities errors in automatic speech recognition (ASR) predictions, achieving 30% relative WER reduction on the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named entities are critical keywords and their misrecognition can significantly impact downstream applications. However, state-of-the-art ASR systems still have high word error rates for named entities.

Method: A large language model (LLM) revision mechanism is introduced to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions. This leverages the LLM's reasoning ability and local context such as lecture notes that contain a set of correct named entities.

Result: The proposed technique achieves up to 30% relative word error rate (WER) reduction for named entities on the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset.

Conclusion: The use of an LLM revision mechanism effectively improves the accuracy of named entity recognition in ASR systems, particularly when applied to complex systems.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

*Qingyan Wei,Yaojie Zhang,Zhiyuan Liu,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) are a new alternative to traditional LLMs, allowing parallel token generation and reducing inference latency. However, current sampling strategies for dLLMs have static behavior that limits efficiency and flexibility. This paper proposes SlowFast Sampling, a dynamic sampling strategy that alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages guided by three principles: certainty, convergence, and positional. It also integrates with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Experiments show that SlowFast Sampling achieves significant speedups on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and even greater speedups when combined with caching. The approach outperforms autoregressive baselines in throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static behavior in existing sampling strategies for diffusion-based language models (dLLMs), which lead to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility.

Method: Propose SlowFast Sampling, a dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. This method is guided by three principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which determine when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. Additionally, integrate this strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$	imes$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$	imes$ when combined with caching. The approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in terms of throughput.

Conclusion: Well-designed sampling strategies can unlock the full potential of diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) for fast and high-quality generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Conclusion: Both base (150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical ModernBERT are released, along with training checkpoints, to support further research in the field.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Method: Domain2Vec decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of meta-domains using a classifier, resulting in domain vectors representing data distributions. These vectors help align training and validation data distributions under the DA² assumption.

Result: Experiments show Domain2Vec finds optimal data mixtures with minimal computational overhead, achieving same validation loss with 51.5% computation and improving downstream performance by 2.83% under same compute budget.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec is an effective approach for enhancing language model pretraining efficiency and scalability, while maintaining or improving downstream task performance.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models' ability to generalize and hallucinate stems from out-of-context reasoning, which associates concepts regardless of causal links. Experiments across five LLMs confirm this, with theoretical analysis showing matrix factorization's role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models can both generalize well and hallucinate incorrect information when acquiring new knowledge through fine-tuning.

Method: Argue that out-of-context reasoning (OCR) is the mechanism behind both generalization and hallucination. Formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task and use a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer to solve it. Conduct theoretical analysis on the role of matrix factorization in OCR.

Result: Confirmed that OCR drives both generalization and hallucination in LLMs depending on causal relationships between concepts. Showed that matrix factorization plays a crucial role in learning associations.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering insights into analyzing and mitigating undesirable behaviors in knowledge injection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究人员提出了一种新的方法，即使用半非负矩阵分解（SNMF）来分解MLP激活，从而识别出可解释的特征。相比现有的稀疏自编码器（SAEs），SNMF在因果转向任务中表现更好，并且与人类可理解的概念一致。此外，研究还揭示了MLP激活空间中的层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前用于分析大语言模型输出的方法，如稀疏自编码器（SAEs），在因果评估中表现不佳且缺乏内在可解释性。因此，需要一种新方法能够更好地识别可解释的特征并直接关联到模型计算。

Method: 通过直接对MLP激活应用半非负矩阵分解（SNMF），将学习到的特征表示为共同激活神经元的稀疏线性组合，并将其映射到激活输入，从而实现直接可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，基于SNMF得出的特征在因果转向任务中优于稀疏自编码器和强大的监督基线（差异均值）。同时，这些特征与人类可解释的概念相一致。进一步分析发现，特定的神经元组合在语义相关的特征中被重复使用，揭示了MLP激活空间中的层次结构。

Conclusion: SNMF是一种简单而有效的方法，可以用来识别可解释的特征并剖析大语言模型中的概念表示。

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

TL;DR: AutoMind is an advanced LLM-agent framework that improves on existing data science automation by incorporating expert knowledge, strategic solution exploration, and adaptive coding strategies, showing superior performance in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current LLM-driven data science agents which rely on rigid workflows and lack the flexibility and expertise of human practitioners, especially for complex tasks.

Method: The framework incorporates a curated expert knowledge base, a knowledgeable tree search algorithm for exploring solutions, and a self-adaptive coding strategy that adjusts based on task complexity.

Result: AutoMind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in automated data science benchmarks, demonstrating better effectiveness, efficiency, and solution quality.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a significant advancement towards fully automated data science, offering both efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

*Hossein A. Rahmani,Varsha Ramineni,Nick Craswell,Bhaskar Mitra,Emine Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the reliability of synthetic test collections created using Large Language Models (LLMs) for evaluating Information Retrieval systems, identifying potential biases in evaluation results and analyzing their impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the challenges of creating diverse user queries and obtaining relevance judgments for evaluating IR systems, and the potential of LLMs to generate synthetic datasets.

Method: The method involves using LLMs to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both, constructing synthetic test collections. The authors empirically examine the presence of bias in evaluation results and validate it using a linear mixed-effects model.

Result: Results show that while bias in synthetic test collections can significantly affect absolute system performance evaluation, its impact on comparing relative system performance may not be as significant.

Conclusion: Synthetic test collections generated by LLMs have potential for system evaluation but require careful consideration of biases, particularly when assessing absolute system performance.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are

### [209] [Contrastive Matrix Completion with Denoising and Augmented Graph Views for Robust Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10658)
*Narges Nemati,Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCCL, a novel matrix completion method using contrastive learning to overcome limitations of GNN-based approaches in recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based methods for matrix completion in recommender systems are sensitive to noisy edges and prone to overfitting, limiting their generalizability.

Method: MCCL extracts local neighborhood subgraphs for each interaction, generates two distinct graph representations (one with denoising via attention mechanism and the other via graph variational autoencoder), and employs a mutual learning loss function during training to harmonize these representations.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show improvements in numerical accuracy (up to 0.8% in RMSE) and ranking metrics (up to 36% improvement).

Conclusion: MCCL enhances generalizability of GNN-based approaches for matrix completion in recommender systems.

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

*Yanhui Li,Dongxia Wang,Zhu Sun,Haonan Zhang,Huizhong Guo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs), but they struggle with sparse interactions even when using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Complex models perform worse in these scenarios. Therefore, the paper proposes LightKG, a simplified GNN-based KGRS that addresses sparsity issues while reducing training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors observe that existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to maintain superior performance under sparse interactions, even with SSL incorporated. Moreover, more complex models tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios, indicating a need for a simpler yet effective model.

Method: LightKG includes a simplified GNN layer encoding directed relations as scalar pairs instead of dense embeddings and uses a linear aggregation framework. It also incorporates an efficient contrastive layer for SSL by minimizing node similarity in the original graph, avoiding subgraph generation and comparison.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and dense scenarios. It improves recommendation accuracy by 5.8% over the best baselines and reduces training time by 84.3% compared to KGRSs with SSL.

Conclusion: LightKG is a simple yet powerful GNN-based KGRS that effectively addresses sparsity issues and significantly reduces training time without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHORE, a new framework for predicting long-term user lifetime value (LTV) in digital gaming that integrates short-horizon predictions and a hybrid loss function. It significantly outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for LTV prediction either rely on short-cycle observations or strong distributional assumptions, leading to underestimation of long-term value or poor robustness due to delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and high-value outliers.

Method: SHORE combines short-horizon predictions as auxiliary tasks with a hybrid loss function that includes order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to address zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show SHORE outperforms existing baselines with a 47.91% relative reduction in prediction error during online deployment.

Conclusion: SHORE is practically effective and robust for industrial-scale LTV prediction in digital games.

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

TL;DR: MGOE is a new framework that uses macro graph embeddings for multi-task learning, improving performance in billion-scale recommender systems through effective incorporation of graph information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect the graph structures which can significantly improve performance.

Method: Proposes Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework which includes Macro Graph Bottom and Macro Prediction Tower to leverage macro graph embeddings and capture task-specific macro features while modeling correlations between task-specific experts.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods through extensive offline experiments on three public benchmark datasets and online A/B tests in billion-scale recommender systems.

Conclusion: Establishes MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based recommendation for billion-scale systems.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

*Kehan Long,Shasha Li,Chen Xu,Jintao Tang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in LLMs have improved zero-shot document ranking. This paper introduces GCCP and PAGC strategies to enhance pointwise methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pointwise approaches for document ranking are efficient but suffer from inconsistent scoring due to ignoring comparative insights between documents.

Method: The paper proposes GCCP strategy that uses global reference comparisons with an anchor document as a query-focused summary of pseudo-relevant candidates, and PAGC method that post-aggregates contrastive relevance scores with existing pointwise methods.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the approach significantly outperforms previous pointwise methods while maintaining efficiency, and is competitive with more computationally intensive comparative methods.

Conclusion: The GCCP and PAGC strategies improve the effectiveness of pointwise document ranking methods without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

*Yuke Xie,Hervé Chauris,Nicolas Desassis*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: Diffusion models show promise in inverse problems, but challenges exist for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging. This work proposes a framework integrating pretrained DDPM as a generative diffusion prior into FWI through score rematching strategy. The method avoids reverse diffusion sampling and operates in the clean image space, promoting stable wave propagation and improving inversion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have shown potential as powerful generative priors for inverse problems, but their application to physics-constrained computational seismic imaging has been limited due to challenges such as instability in non-linear solvers like Full Waveform Inversion (FWI).

Method: The proposed method integrates a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. It avoids the reverse diffusion process, operates entirely in the clean image space, and introduces the generative diffusion prior as a regularization term in the standard FWI update rule.

Result: Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method enhances fidelity and robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other inverse problem tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical and effective solution for integrating diffusion models into FWI, addressing the challenges of instability and computational efficiency in physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for automatically constructing a classifier for processed data from decameter coherent scatter radars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automatic method to classify radar data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars using only the radar data, automatic modeling of radio wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating model quality.

Method: The method involves training a model with data collected over two years from 12 radars within the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks. The model uses both calculated parameters of radio wave propagation in the ionosphere and parameters directly measured by the radar, with calibration done using meteor trail scattered signals.

Result: The analysis determined that the optimal number of classes is 37, with 25 being frequently observed. Among these, 14 classes were confidently separated across different model trainings, and a preliminary interpretation was conducted on 10 of them. It was also found that the most important parameters for class identification are the shape of the signal ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height, and the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

Conclusion: The presented method successfully constructs a classifier that identifies various classes of radar data. The dynamics of class observations align with known physical mechanisms, and the most critical parameters for classification have been identified.

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and

Method: Using a static code analysis framework to detect issues, extracting detailed information on each issue, applying an iterative prompt engineering process, implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and using a custom-built 'Code Comparison App' to address LLM hallucinations.

Result: Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG is effective in improving code quality and streamlining the software development process.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

*Andrei Paleyes,Radzim Sendyka,Diana Robinson,Christian Cabrera,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种与LLM相关的代码生成的综合评估管道以及基于角色的系统评估方法，以量化输入变化对LLM生成代码的影响，并且展示了其广泛适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）降低了编写代码的门槛并加速了开发过程，但生成程序的整体质量仍然取决于给定提示的质量。特别是，生成代码的功能和质量可能受到用户背景和软件开发熟悉程度的影响，因此需要量化LLM对输入变化的敏感性。

Method: 提出了一个合成评估管道用于LLM代码生成，以及一种基于角色的系统评估方法来揭示不同用户背景下的LLM响应的定性差异。这些方法独立于具体的编程任务和特定的LLM，具有广泛的适用性。

Result: 提供了实验依据，证明了所提出方法的有效性，并分享了代码以促进社区的发展。

Conclusion: 所提出的评估方法可以有效揭示LLM生成代码时对用户背景的依赖性，并为未来的研究提供了工具支持。

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

*Vinaik Chhetri,Krishna Upadhyay,A. B. Siddique,Umar Farooq*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper conducts a large-scale study on user feedback of AI-powered mobile apps, developing a multi-stage analysis pipeline to extract and cluster aspect-sentiment pairs, revealing key themes in both positive and negative user feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how users perceive, evaluate, and critique AI features in mobile apps, addressing the gap caused by the overwhelming volume of user feedback.

Method: Developed and validated a multi-stage analysis pipeline starting with human-labeled benchmark, systematically evaluating LLMs and prompting strategies. The pipeline includes review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering stages.

Result: Extracted over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Revealed narrow set of themes in feedback such as productivity, reliability, technical failures, pricing concerns, and language support limitations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a more accurate reflection of real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps, uncovering universal satisfaction drivers and domain-specific frustrations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

*Surya Jasper,Minh Luu,Evan Pan,Aakash Tyagi,Michael Quinn,Jiang Hu,David Kebo Houngninou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents BugGen, an autonomous multi-agent pipeline using Large Language Models to generate realistic functional bugs in RTL designs. It significantly improves bug generation efficiency and quality compared to manual or automated methods, enhances verification coverage, and aids in training ML-based failure triage models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing hardware complexity strains verification resources, prompting the need for machine learning methods to improve debug efficiency. Existing bug insertion methods fail to reliably produce diverse and scalable bug datasets.

Method: BugGen is a fully autonomous, multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically generate, insert, and validate functional bugs in RTL designs. It partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability.

Result: BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy across five OpenTitan IP blocks at a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour. It identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions and outperformed Certitude in syntactic accuracy and exposing testbench blind spots. Using BugGen-generated datasets to train ML-based failure triage models achieved high classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%).

Conclusion: BugGen provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

*Lianghong Guo,Yanlin Wang,Caihua Li,Pengyu Yang,Jiachi Chen,Wei Tao,Yingtian Zou,Duyu Tang,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline with three core components for constructing large-scale GitHub issue resolution datasets to facilitate training and evaluation of software engineering capabilities in LLMs. It significantly reduces costs and efforts while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for large-scale datasets for training and evaluating LLMs' software engineering capabilities, but the traditional process is challenging and labor-intensive.

Method: SWE-Factory includes: 1) SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system for automating evaluation environment construction; 2) A standardized, exit-code-based grading method; 3) Automated fail2pass validation using exit code signals.

Result: Experiments show that SWE-Factory can effectively construct valid task instances at low cost. The exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and the automated fail2pass validation has a precision of 0.92 and recall of 1.00.

Conclusion: SWE-Factory accelerates the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for training and evaluation, reducing costs and efforts.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at

Motivation: 变分量子电路（VQCs）在量子机器学习中具有潜力，但受限于线性表达能力有限、优化困难以及对量子硬件噪声敏感等问题，需要一种新的架构来克服这些障碍。

Method: 提出VQC-MLPNet，利用量子电路通过振幅编码和参数化量子操作动态生成经典多层感知器（MLPs）的参数，从而扩展表示能力和增强训练稳定性。并通过统计学习技术和神经切线核分析提供严格的理论保证。

Conclusion: VQC-MLPNet为量子增强学习提供了一个理论严谨且实践稳健的框架，推动了在嘈杂中等规模量子时代及以后的非常规计算范式的发展。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

### [224] [Equitable Mechanism Design for Facility Location](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10460)
*Toby Walsh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores strategy proof mechanisms for facility location that maximize equitability among agents, measured by the Gini index. It proves an impossibility result regarding strategy proof mechanisms and approximation ratios of optimal Gini index, proposes using complemented Gini index instead, and examines how well deterministic/randomized mechanisms approximate this as well as Nash welfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To find strategy proof mechanisms for facility location that can maximize equitability between agents, which is measured by the Gini index.

Method: Firstly, prove an impossibility result about no strategy proof mechanism being able to bound the approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities. Then, consider computing approximation ratios of the complemented Gini index of utilities and examine how well deterministic and randomized mechanisms approximate this. Finally, consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash welfare.

Result: Proved an impossibility result. Proposed a new approach by considering the complemented Gini index. Examined the performance of deterministic and randomized mechanisms in approximating the complemented Gini index and the Nash welfare.

Conclusion: Strategy proof mechanisms cannot bound the approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index. However, considering the complemented Gini index and Nash welfare provides alternative ways to evaluate the equitability of mechanisms.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) 模型作为一个典型的1D拓扑绝缘体，在更复杂的实际条件下其行为尚未被充分研究，这为研究提供了动力。

Method: 采用精确对角化和专门的数值求解器分析系统相空间；使用逆参与比（IPR）量化系统的谱性质和局域化特性；运用无监督机器学习（PCA）分类系统相；探讨非厄米性及周期性弗洛凯驱动的影响。

Result: 标准SSH模型展示出拓扑保护边缘态，但强AAH调制会破坏这些状态；强局域化可能掩盖底层拓扑特征；发现非厄米性导致所有本征态在边界处剧烈局域化的非厄米皮肤效应；成功将拓扑平庸链转化为弗洛凯拓扑绝缘体。

Conclusion: 综合研究展示了广义1D拓扑系统中丰富的物理现象。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Motivation: To understand and control the atomistic-level reactions governing the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in next-generation solid state batteries, overcoming challenges in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and limits in simulation speed and accuracy.

Method: Large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy using active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials, unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments.

Result: Revealed the formation of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the SEI, explained experimental observations of SEI formations and elucidated the Li creep mechanisms.

Conclusion: The approach creates a digital twin from first principles without adjustable parameters fitted to experiment, offering insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel loss function and a 'speaker code' for robust adaptation of speech recognisers to new speakers with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognisers typically require adaptation to perform optimally in different environments or for different speakers, but there is often insufficient labelled data for fine-tuning.

Method: The paper introduces a conditional entropy over complete hypotheses as a loss function and uses a 'speaker code' to characterise speakers in a compact vector form.

Result: On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the proposed method achieves a 20% relative improvement in word error rate with one minute of adaptation data and 29% with ten minutes.

Conclusion: The combination of the novel loss function and 'speaker code' makes adaptation to new speakers more robust, especially when data is limited.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

*Xia Du,Xiaoyuan Liu,Jizhe Zhou,Zheng Lin,Chi-man Pun,Zhe Chen,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a new framework using Large Language Models to generate high-quality adversarial CAPTCHAs that can perform both targeted and untargeted attacks, showing high success rates without affecting human interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning advancements have made traditional CAPTCHAs vulnerable to automated attacks by DNNs. Current adversarial attack methods often distort images, hindering human interpretation and limiting their applicability in scenarios without initial input images.

Method: The UAC framework generates adversarial examples guided by text prompts using a Large Language Model. For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a diffusion model. In untargeted black-box attacks, BP-UAC employs multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization in a two-step strategy for efficient misclassification.

Result: Experiments indicate that BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across various systems while producing natural CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

Conclusion: UAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and enables effective adversarial attacks with high fidelity, maintaining human interpretability.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPARKE, a method for improving prompt-aware diversity in text-to-image diffusion models without significant computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to ensure adequate diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models, especially when prompts cover a wide semantic range and require evaluation across semantically similar prompts.

Method: SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance, dynamically conditioning diversity measurement on similar prompts to enable prompt-aware diversity control. It focuses on Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance to reduce computational complexity from O(n^3) to O(n).

Result: SPARKE improves prompt-aware diversity in generated data across several text-to-image diffusion models without incurring significant computational costs.

Conclusion: SPARKE is an effective method for enhancing diversity in prompt-guided diffusion models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

TL;DR: This paper introduces ScoreMix, a data augmentation strategy using diffusion model score mixing to improve discriminator performance especially in scenarios with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enhancing discriminator performance when labeled data is scarce by leveraging the properties of diffusion models.

Method: ScoreMix mixes scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling to create challenging synthetic samples. It also investigates optimal class-selection strategies for mixing.

Result: Significant improvements in discriminative capabilities across all studied benchmarks. Best performance gains when combining classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space rather than close in the generator's condition space. Minimal correlation between generator's learned condition space and discriminator's embedding space under standard metrics.

Conclusion: ScoreMix achieves notable performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, offering practical advantages for training discriminative models while reducing reliance on large datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 准确可靠的皮肤癌诊断对早期治疗和改善患者预后至关重要。本文评估了基于深度学习的皮肤病变分类方法，使用迁移学习和不确定性量化技术在HAM10000数据集上的表现。研究分为两个阶段：第一阶段基准测试了几种预训练特征提取器与传统分类器的组合；第二阶段通过集成不确定性量化方法来评估模型预测的准确性和可靠性。结果表明，CLIP视觉变换器与SVM结合表现出最佳分类性能，而集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理之间提供了良好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确可靠的皮肤癌诊断对于患者的早期治疗和预后改善非常重要。然而，现有的深度学习模型在数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性意识的情况下，性能可能受到限制。因此，需要一种能够有效应对这些问题的方法来提升皮肤癌分类的准确性与可靠性。

Method: 本研究采用两阶段方法：

1. 在第一阶段，使用多个预训练特征提取器（如CLIP变体、ResNet50、DenseNet121、VGG16和EfficientNet-V2-Large）与传统分类器（如SVM、XGBoost和逻辑回归）相结合，进行基准测试。
2. 在第二阶段，引入不确定性量化技术（包括Monte Carlo Dropout、Ensemble和Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout），并使用不确定性感知度量（如UAcc、USen、USpe和UPre）评估模型的准确性和可靠性。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于CLIP的视觉变换器（特别是LAION CLIP ViT-H/14与SVM结合）在分类性能上表现最佳。同时，集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理之间提供了良好的平衡，而EMCD对不确定预测更为敏感。

Conclusion: 将不确定性量化整合到基于深度学习的医疗诊断中，可以显著提升模型的性能和可信度，从而更好地应用于实际临床场景。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症类型，每年造成超过80亿美元的医疗保健支出。目前医生通过详细的SOAP笔记记录患者就诊情况，但手动生成这些笔记工作量大，容易导致医生倦怠。因此需要一种更高效的方法自动生成SOAP笔记。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，利用有限的输入（包括病变图像和稀疏临床文本）生成结构化的SOAP笔记。该方法减少了对人工标注的依赖，同时保持了临床依据，从而可以大规模应用，减轻医生负担并减少对大型标注数据的需求。

Result: 该方法在关键临床相关指标上的表现与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当。为了评估临床质量，提出了两个新指标：MedConceptEval和Clinical Coherence Score (CCS)，分别评估与专家医学概念和输入特征的语义一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的弱监督多模态框架能够有效生成结构化的SOAP笔记，具有临床实用性，同时显著降低了对人工标注数据的需求，有助于减轻医生的工作负担。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for analyzing students' academic emotions through facial expressions in an online learning environment. The models, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, were tested on 5,000 images using zero-shot prompting. Results show moderate performance with Qwen2.5 outperforming Llama-3.2, particularly in recognizing confused and happy expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional supervised machine learning algorithms which struggle to generalize across different contexts when analyzing students' academic emotions.

Method: Two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, were employed to analyze 5,000 images of various student facial expressions using zero-shot prompting.

Result: Both models demonstrated moderate performance in recognizing academic emotions from facial expressions without requiring fine-tuning. Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperformed Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, especially in identifying confused and happy expressions.

Conclusion: Vision-Language Models offer a promising alternative for emotion analysis in educational settings, capable of generalizing across contexts without additional training.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

Method: Propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, construct UrbanDiffBench dataset containing architectural images from different periods and regions, develop UrbanSense framework for urban streetscape analysis.

Result: Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05), high Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences.

Conclusion: The method has potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

Method: Introducing Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation.

Result: Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. It demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding and exhibits robust generative capabilities on GenEval.

Conclusion: The synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation is revealed, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders are shown, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic

*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of weight initialization on DNN quantization and introduces GHN-QAT, a new method using Graph Hypernetworks to predict parameters for quantized DNNs, showing significant improvements in quantized accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of research on improving the initial conditions of DNN training for quantization, despite its potential impact on quantization robustness.

Method: An extensive study was conducted to examine the effects of different weight initializations on CNN building blocks. The paper then explores a new method called GHN-QAT which uses Graph Hypernetworks to predict parameters for quantized DNNs.

Result: GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32 pretraining. Finetuning GHNs with GHN-QAT further improves quantized accuracy, especially for 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits.

Conclusion: This is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model design and opens up possibilities for future investigations.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSLG-SAM framework for Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) that divides the task into coarse localization and fine segmentation stages, reducing annotation needs and enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRSIS methods encounter challenges such as dense annotation requirements and complex scene interpretation.

Method: PSLG-SAM decomposes RRSIS into two stages - coarse localization using a visual grounding network and fine segmentation guided by coordinates from the first stage with enhancements like clustering-based foreground point generator and mask boundary iterative optimization.

Result: PSLG-SAM achieves significant performance improvements on two datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M), surpassing existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed PSLG-SAM framework successfully addresses the limitations of current RRSIS methods and demonstrates superior performance. A new annotated dataset is also contributed.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper identifies challenges in streaming video reasoning due to computational burden and irrelevant context. It introduces the CogStream task, a densely annotated dataset, and CogReasoner, a baseline model that uses visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval to efficiently handle these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of streaming video reasoning which current Vid-LLMs struggle with due to heavy reliance on all historical contextual information leading to significant computational burden and distraction from key details.

Method: Introduced CogStream task for real-world streaming video scenarios, created a densely annotated dataset with hierarchical question-answer pairs, and proposed CogReasoner model which uses visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the CogReasoner model in tackling the Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning task.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by presenting a novel task (CogStream), supporting dataset, and effective baseline model (CogReasoner) to advance streaming video reasoning while promising to release the code.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning can effectively fine-tune large language models for challenging tasks, but its success in vision-language models has been limited. This paper introduces ViCrit, a new RL task that trains VLMs to detect subtle errors in image captions, providing an unambiguous reward signal. Models trained with ViCrit show significant improvements across various benchmarks and generalize well beyond natural-image training data. The authors also introduce ViCrit-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating perception errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are both challenging and verifiable, which has impeded the extension of reinforcement learning's success in fine-tuning large language models to visual perception in vision-language models.

Method: Introduce ViCrit, an RL proxy task where VLMs are trained to localize a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into human-written image captions. A single, subtle visual description error is introduced into 200-word captions, and the model must pinpoint the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption.

Result: Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains across a variety of VL benchmarks. The improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

### [245] [From Images to Insights: Explainable Biodiversity Monitoring with Plain Language Habitat Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10559)
*Yutong Zhou,Masahiro Ryo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end visual-to-causal framework is proposed to transform species image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference, integrating species recognition, global occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.

Method: The system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. Then it discovers causal structures among environmental features and estimates their influence on species occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, it generates statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured templates and large language models.

Result: Demonstrated the framework on a bee and a flower species and reported early results as part of an ongoing project, showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended ecological modeling practice.

Conclusion: This multimodal AI assistant has the potential to describe species habitat in human-understandable language.

### [246] [Balancing Tails when Comparing Distributions: Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) with Application to Bias Evaluation in Operational Face Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10564)
*Imanol Solano,Julian Fierrez,Aythami Morales,Alejandro Peña,Ruben Tolosana,Francisco Zamora-Martinez,Javier San Agustin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) and its automated version CEI^A, novel metrics for detecting demographic bias in face recognition systems by analyzing score distributions including tails. Extensive experiments show their superior ability to reveal nuanced biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics often fail to detect demographic bias in high-performance face recognition systems, especially subtle disparities in the tails of the score distribution.

Method: CEI analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, focusing on tail probabilities and overall distribution shapes. CEI^A is an automated version enhancing objectivity and simplifying application.

Result: CEI and CEI^A effectively detect nuanced biases in state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets where previous methods fall short.

Conclusion: CEI provides a robust tool for operational FR fairness assessment and can be applied to compare statistical distributions in other fields focusing on distribution tails.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

*Lizhen Wang,Zhurong Xia,Tianshu Hu,Pengrui Wang,Pengfei Wang,Zerong Zheng,Ming Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In e-commerce and digital marketing, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework is proposed to generate high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos. It preserves human and product identities, understands human-product spatial relationships, and generates realistic motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for generating human-product demonstration videos either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, resulting in unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions.

Method: The proposed method uses a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework which injects paired human-product reference information and utilizes an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. A 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes provide motion guidance while structured text encoding incorporates category-level semantics.

Result: Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, this approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

Conclusion: This Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework effectively addresses the challenges of preserving identities and understanding spatial relationships in human-product demonstration videos.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

### [248] [TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10612)
*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TexTailor, a new method for generating consistent object textures from text descriptions. It solves issues of texture consistency across viewpoints by applying a resampling scheme and fine-tuning a diffusion model, while also adaptively adjusting camera positions based on object geometry. Experiments show TexTailor outperforms current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-texture synthesis approaches suffer from gradual shifts in texture properties across viewpoints due to insufficient integration of previously synthesized textures during the diffusion process and the autoregressive nature of texture synthesis. Also, predefined camera positions that don't consider object geometry limit effective use of texture information synthesized from different viewpoints.

Method: TexTailor applies a resampling scheme that repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process and fine-tunes a depth-aware diffusion model on these resampled textures. Additionally, it proposes an performance preservation loss to mitigate the restriction on the model's original ability to generate high-fidelity images when using only a few training images. Camera positions are adaptively adjusted based on the object's geometry.

Result: Experiments on a subset of the Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Conclusion: TexTailor is a novel method that improves the consistency of synthesized object textures from textual descriptions by addressing issues related to texture integration, model fine-tuning, and camera position adjustment.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

*Francisco Caetano,Christiaan Viviers,Peter H. N. De With,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow) is a new framework that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. It uses a symmetric learning objective to ensure bi-directional consistency and preserve generative diversity. The new training objective retains semantic information across flows, allowing for efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure. SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified model that can handle semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation tasks effectively, ensuring bi-directional consistency and preserving generative diversity.

Method: SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly using a symmetric learning objective, which ensures bi-directional consistency. A new training objective explicitly retains semantic information across flows, enabling efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure. This allows for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement.

Result: SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis with FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff in just 25 inference steps. It also delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks.

Conclusion: SymmFlow successfully unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model, achieving state-of-the-art performance in semantic image synthesis and competitive results in other tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

*Marzieh Oghbaie,Teresa Araújoa,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT is a patch-based visual interpretable prototypical model that leverages vision transformer to capture long-range dependencies among patches and learn robust, human-interpretable prototypes for medical image recognition. It achieves competitive performance on retinal OCT image classification while providing meaningful explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based methods often produce extremely granular prototypes which may not be consistent with human-understandable biomarkers in medical imaging.

Method: PiPViT uses a vision transformer to capture long-range dependencies among patches and learn robust, human-interpretable prototypes. It benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution input processing to effectively localize biomarkers across scales.

Result: PiPViT achieved competitive quantitative performance on retinal OCT image classification across four datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods, while delivering more meaningful explanations. The learned prototypes were confirmed to be semantically and clinically relevant.

Conclusion: PiPViT can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm using hyperbolic space for hierarchical data, improving multi-granularity recognition and validated on EgoObjects dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning focuses solely on instances or classes, but real-world applications need models to handle both simultaneously. There is a need for a model that can balance fine-grained instance recognition with coarse-grained class generalization over time.

Method: The authors propose HyperCLIC, an algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space to model hierarchical relationships between classes and instances. The framework includes hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives to embed hierarchical relations continually. They also introduce continual hierarchical metrics for performance evaluation.

Result: Empirical results on the EgoObjects dataset demonstrate that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: HyperCLIC successfully addresses the challenge of continual learning of instances and classes by utilizing hyperbolic space, showing promise in real-world applications requiring multi-granularity recognition.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种使用深度神经网络生成合成金标准的方法，以解决InP多项目晶圆制造中缺陷检测的手动和劳动密集型问题。该方法通过从CAD数据模拟逼真的InP晶圆图像，并在合成数据和InP晶圆照片上评估模拟图像的质量，优于基于决策树的基线方法，可实现更高效的缺陷检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半导体制造中，质量控制通常依赖于与已知金标准的模板匹配。然而，在InP多项目晶圆制造中，由于生产规模小和设计变化大，导致金标准通常不可用，从而使缺陷检测变得手动且劳动密集。

Method: 提出了一种使用深度神经网络生成合成金标准的方法，训练模型从CAD数据模拟逼真的InP晶圆图像。并通过评估不同训练目标来提高图像模拟质量。

Result: 该基于深度学习的方法在合成数据和InP晶圆照片上的表现优于基于决策树的基线方法，能够生成'模拟金粒'用于晶圆任何用户定义区域的缺陷检测。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可以生成高质量的合成金标准，从而提高了缺陷检测效率，并展示了其在表面缺陷检测中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

TL;DR: The paper aims to enhance understanding of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers by developing a unifying image processing framework, which improves interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The self-attention mechanism is largely heuristic-driven and difficult to interpret. Existing frameworks lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of architectural components that enhance self-attention.

Method: Developing a unifying image processing framework to explain self-attention computation and roles of components like positional encoding and residual connections. Introducing two independent architectural modifications within transformers.

Result: Empirical observations show that the image processing-inspired modifications lead to improved accuracy, robustness against data contamination and adversaries, and better long sequence understanding across language and vision tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances interpretability of the self-attention mechanism and its associated components, while also improving performance in various tasks.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的任意尺度图像超分辨率（ASISR）方法在放大倍率超出训练数据范围时性能大幅下降，导致图像模糊严重。

Method: 提出了统一模型Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier（SbCA），通过笔画向量放大器将图像分解为一系列矢量图形表示的笔画进行放大，并用细节完成模块恢复丢失的细节。采用循环策略，通过迭代细化细节实现超大尺度放大，且仅需一次训练适用于所有子尺度。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上均显著优于现有方法，在超大尺度放大任务（如100倍）中提供了远超现有技术的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SbCA模型有效解决了分布漂移问题，消除了伪影、噪声和模糊，生成高质量高分辨率的超分辨图像。

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CIDer, a robust MER framework addressing modality missing and OOD data challenges with fewer parameters and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods struggle to handle both modality missing and OOD data simultaneously, often relying on specific models or introducing excessive parameters which limits their practicality.

Method: CIDer integrates MSSD and MACI modules. MSSD enhances robustness under RMFM through weight-sharing self-distillation across low-level features, attention maps, and high-level representations. WSAM reduces computational complexity while MCT facilitates efficient multimodal fusion. MACI uses a causal graph with MCM and counterfactual texts to mitigate label and language biases and enhance OOD generalization independently with minimal additional parameters.

Result: CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CIDer provides a novel solution for robust MER by effectively handling modality missing and OOD data challenges, demonstrating superior performance with reduced parameters and computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

TL;DR: To overcome the limitations of current object-centric dynamic simulation methods, the paper introduces SlotPi, a model that integrates physical knowledge and validates adaptability across diverse scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for object-centric dynamic simulation emulate human behavior but overlook integrating physical knowledge into models and validating model adaptability across diverse scenarios.

Method: SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric reasoning model, integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.

Result: Experiments show the model's strengths in tasks like prediction and Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. A real-world dataset was created to validate the model's capabilities.

Conclusion: The robust performance of SlotPi across all datasets highlights its strong adaptability, providing a foundation for developing more advanced world models.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic

### [258] [Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10840)
*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents PTQ4VM, a novel Post-Training Quantization framework for video matting models which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significant FLOP savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting is essential in various applications but deploying its models on resource-constrained devices is challenging due to computational intensity. Existing PTQ methods struggle with maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence in video matting.

Method: A two-stage PTQ strategy combining block-reconstruction-based optimization and global calibration of quantization parameters, a Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method, and an Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component leveraging temporal and semantic priors from frames.

Result: PTQ4VM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across different bit-widths compared to existing quantization methods. The 4-bit PTQ4VM performs close to full-precision while saving 8x FLOPs.

Conclusion: The proposed PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models successfully addresses the challenges of maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence in low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VRBench, a new benchmark for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities with long narrative videos. It includes a dataset of 1,010 videos and a collaborative framework generating reasoning chains. A multi-phase evaluation pipeline is designed to assess models comprehensively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity, especially in long narrative videos.

Method: Developed VRBench which consists of 1,010 long videos along with human-labeled question-answering pairs and reasoning steps. Also developed a human-AI collaborative framework generating coherent reasoning chains and a multi-phase evaluation pipeline assessing models at both outcome and process levels.

Result: Conducted extensive evaluations on 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs using VRBench, providing valuable insights into advancing the field of multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: VRBench offers an effective tool for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities and provides comprehensive insights through its evaluation pipeline.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

### [260] [AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895)
*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained generator to a target domain using only text guidance. However, existing methods suffer from quality degradation due to offset misalignment in the CLIP embedding space. This paper first analyzes the misalignment between text and image offsets, finding it correlates with concept distance. Then, it proposes Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR), which improves target domain image quality and achieves SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of existing ZSGM methods where the learning objective assumes complete alignment between image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, leading to quality degradation in generated images.

Method: The method involves two main contributions: 1) an empirical study analyzing the misalignment between text offset and image offset in the CLIP embedding space for various datasets, revealing that offset misalignment correlates with concept distance; 2) proposing AIR, the first ZSGM approach focusing on improving target domain image quality based on the insight of offset misalignment.

Result: Qualitative, quantitative, and user studies across 26 experiment setups consistently show that the proposed AIR approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: This work highlights the issue of offset misalignment in ZSGM and proposes a novel approach (AIR) that significantly improves the quality of generated images in the target domain.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

*Jiancheng Huang,Gengwei Zhang,Zequn Jie,Siyu Jiao,Yinlong Qian,Ling Chen,Yunchao Wei,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for efficient text-to-video generation that reduces computational costs while maintaining high video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video generation is computationally demanding due to the vast spatiotemporal space and quadratic complexity in sequence processing when using Transformers. Existing linear-time models like Mamba lack the design needed for multi-modal and spatiotemporal tasks.

Method: Introduced M4V with a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block for integrating multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling, reducing FLOPs by 45% compared to attention-based alternatives. Also employed a reward learning strategy to enhance visual realism in long-context generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks show M4V's capability to produce high-quality videos with significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: M4V efficiently addresses the challenges of text-to-video generation by lowering computational demands and preserving video quality, with code and models to be publicly available.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Method: Introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences, design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks (next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction), and propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. It also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.

Conclusion: The model learned directly from videos shows strong in-context image editing capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and showing promise in various applications such as multi-concept composition and story generation.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework that achieves sequence causality and token efficiency for autoregressive image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive visual generation is scalable and compatible with other modalities compared to diffusion models, but existing methods using image patches contradict the causal nature of autoregressive modeling.

Method: The method involves transforming images into ordered spectral tokens with Nested Spectral Tokenization, which represent different frequency components. Autoregressive generation is then performed in a coarse-to-fine manner using these spectral tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that SpectralAR achieves a 3.02 gFID score with only 64 tokens and 310 million parameters.

Conclusion: SpectralAR realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective, achieving both sequence causality and token efficiency.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

### [264] [Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967)
*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), reducing visual tokens is crucial for lowering inference costs. Current pruning methods either retain duplicates or ignore instruction relevance, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper introduces CDPruner, a novel method that maximizes conditional diversity of visual tokens based on user instructions using determinantal point process (DPP). It's training-free and model-agnostic, showing superior performance across diverse MLLMs and significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper stems from the need to reduce the high inference cost in MLLMs caused by the excessive length of input visual tokens compared to textual ones. Existing pruning techniques either retain numerous duplicate tokens or overlook instruction relevance, both of which lead to suboptimal performance.

Method: The authors propose CDPruner, a new visual token pruning method that maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. They define the conditional similarity between visual tokens given an instruction and reformulate the token pruning problem using DPP to select a subset with maximum conditional diversity. This approach does not require training and can be applied to any MLLM.

Result: CDPruner establishes a new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks across different MLLMs. When used with LLaVA, it reduces FLOPs by 95% and CUDA latency by 78%, while retaining 94% of the original accuracy.

Conclusion: CDPruner successfully addresses the limitations of previous pruning methods by maximizing conditional diversity through DPP. It is easy to apply due to being training-free and model-agnostic, and it significantly lowers computational costs without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In this paper, researchers explore the granularity of attention perturbations in diffusion models and propose 'HeadHunter', a framework for selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives. They also introduce SoftPAG to tune perturbation strength. This approach mitigates oversmoothing issues and enables targeted manipulation of visual styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, especially in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures.

Method: The method involves investigating the granularity of attention perturbations from layer level down to individual attention heads. The researchers propose 'HeadHunter' for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives and 'SoftPAG' which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map towards an identity matrix.

Result: This approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. Superior performance was demonstrated in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance.

Conclusion: The work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

*Malvern Madondo,Yuan Shao,Yingzi Liu,Jun Zhou,Xiaofeng Yang,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) replanning in head-and-neck cancer treatment, which surpasses manual replanning in plan quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anatomical changes during IMPT for head-and-neck cancer can cause Bragg peak shifts, risking tumor underdosing and organ-at-risk overdosing. Current manual replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: The authors formulate the IMPT replanning process as a reinforcement learning problem. They implement two DRL algorithms - Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization - using dose-volume histograms as state representations and a 22-dimensional action space of priority adjustments. Personalized agents are trained for each patient using their planning CT and augmented anatomies simulating anatomical changes.

Result: Evaluation on five HNC patients showed that both DRL agents improved initial plan scores significantly compared to manual replans generated by a human planner. Clinical validation confirmed better tumor coverage and organ-at-risk sparing across diverse anatomical changes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of DRL in addressing geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton therapy.

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI5GTest, an AI-powered testing framework for automating the validation of O-RAN components. It uses a cooperative LLM framework including Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and Debug-LLM to generate test flows, validate compliance, and perform root cause analysis respectively. AI5GTest reduces test execution time while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: O-RAN's disaggregated architecture brings complex testing challenges with existing frameworks relying on manual processes that are fragmented, inconsistent, and prone to human error.

Method: AI5GTest leverages a cooperative LLM framework (Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, Debug-LLM) to automate test flow generation, compliance validation, and root cause analysis. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is also incorporated for approval before proceeding with validation.

Result: AI5GTest significantly reduces overall test execution time compared to traditional manual methods while maintaining high validation accuracy when evaluated using test cases from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications.

Conclusion: AI5GTest addresses limitations in current O-RAN component testing by providing an automated, specification-aware solution that enhances efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel extension to Space-O-RAN using MCP and A2A protocols for lunar surface wireless communication systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lunar surface operations require wireless communication systems with autonomy, robustness to disruption, and adaptability to context.

Method: Incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols into Space-O-RAN.

Result: Enables context-aware decision making across different control layers and implements wireless-aware coordination strategies.

Conclusion: Distributed cognitive agents enhance the capabilities of lunar wireless communication systems through delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic compression.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight
1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which
achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K
parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations
(FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies
ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8,
suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32
counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two
microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive
Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and
115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference,
respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted
traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security

### [270] [Structure and asymptotic preserving deep neural surrogates for uncertainty quantification in multiscale kinetic equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10636)
*Wei Chen,Giacomo Dimarco,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: To address the computational challenges in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for high-dimensional kinetic equations with stochastic parameters, this paper proposes a multiscale control variates strategy and surrogate models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs). The method reduces variance, maintains physical consistency, and improves accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional Monte Carlo techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters leads to significant computational challenges in UQ. Traditional Monte Carlo methods have issues with slow convergence and high variance, which worsen as the dimensionality increases.

Method: The paper adopts a multiscale control variates strategy that uses low-fidelity solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. It also introduces surrogate models based on SAPNNs, which are trained on low-fidelity models and enriched with selected high-fidelity samples. These neural networks satisfy key physical properties such as positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and asymptotic limits.

Result: Numerical results show that the proposed methodology achieves improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques across both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed multiscale control variates strategy and SAPNN-based surrogate models provide an efficient way to perform large-scale predictions in kinetic UQ while maintaining physical consistency and asymptotic accuracy.

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

### [271] [On feature selection in double-imbalanced data settings: a Random Forest approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10929)
*Fabio Demaria*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: In high-dimensional classification tasks with double imbalance, traditional feature selection methods for Random Forests can be unstable. This paper introduces a new thresholding scheme based on minimal depth to improve variable relevance assessment, resulting in more accurate and parsimonious subsets of variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability and misleading importance rankings of features in high-dimensional classification tasks under conditions of double imbalance (class imbalance and dimensional asymmetry).

Method: Propose a novel thresholding scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth that uses tree topology to assess variable relevance in Random Forests.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the proposed method yields more parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal depth-based selection.

Conclusion: The new thresholding scheme provides a practical and interpretable solution for variable selection in Random Forests under double imbalance conditions.

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

### [272] [The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872)
*Ziv Scully,Alexander Terenin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper aims to show the practical applications of the Gittins index in decision-making problems, despite its limited use and complex definition. It provides an example-driven introduction and demonstrates optimal and suboptimal problem-solving with the Gittins index, including Bayesian optimization and minimizing tail latency in queues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that the Gittins index can be effectively applied to practical decision-making problems, even though it is often seen as a primarily theoretical concept due to its limited applicability and subtle definition compared to other multi-armed bandit algorithms.

Method: Providing an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index and walking through several examples of problems it solves, both optimally and suboptimally but still with excellent performance.

Result: Two practical highlights are applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization and minimizing tail latency in queues.

Conclusion: The Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems, despite its reputation as a primarily theoretical tool.

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

### [273] [FastFLUX: Pruning FLUX with Block-wise Replacement and Sandwich Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10035)
*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have led to highly expressive models like FLUX. However, these models suffer from slow inference and high memory usage. Existing acceleration methods often degrade performance or incur high training costs. To address this, the paper proposes FastFLUX, which uses Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) and Sandwich Training (ST) to enhance inference efficiency while maintaining image quality. Experiments show that FastFLUX significantly improves inference speed even when 20% of the hierarchy is pruned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve the inference efficiency of highly expressive text-to-image generation models like FLUX, which currently suffer from slow inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration methods either degrade performance or are costly in terms of training.

Method: The method proposed in this paper is FastFLUX, an architecture-level pruning framework for enhancing the inference efficiency of FLUX. It includes two key components: Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL), which replaces structurally complex residual branches with lightweight linear layers while preserving shortcut connections for stability; and Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning strategy using LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks to mitigate performance drops caused by structural replacement.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while significantly improving inference speed. Even with 20% of the hierarchy pruned, the model shows excellent performance.

Conclusion: FastFLUX successfully addresses the limitations of current text-to-image generation models by enhancing inference efficiency without compromising on image quality. The proposed BRLL and ST methods effectively reduce computational demands while preserving performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

*Giannis Daras,Adrian Rodriguez-Munoz,Adam Klivans,Antonio Torralba,Constantinos Daskalakis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper explores using low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to improve diffusion model quality via Ambient Diffusion Omni framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage typically discarded lower-quality images to enhance the performance of diffusion models.

Method: Ambient Diffusion Omni framework that exploits spectral power law decay and locality properties of natural images to extract signal from all available images during training.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art ImageNet FID and significant improvements in image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling.

Conclusion: Noise dampens the skew between desired high-quality distribution and observed mixed distribution; theoretical justification provided for the approach.

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

*Yanwen Huang,Lok Ming Lui,Gary P. T. Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度神经网络的学习型密度均衡映射框架（LDEM），通过引入损失函数和分层方法，解决了传统方法在精度、重叠伪影和从2D扩展到3D时的局限性。该方法适用于简单的和复杂的密度分布，并可无缝推广到3D领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的密度均衡映射方法依赖迭代数值求解器或优化方法，但存在精度有限、极端情况下产生重叠伪影以及从2D扩展到3D时需要大量算法重新设计的问题。因此，需要一种更精确、更鲁棒且易于扩展的方法。

Method: 作者提出了一个基于深度学习的密度均衡映射框架（LDEM）。具体来说，他们设计了一个损失函数以确保密度均匀性和几何规则性，并采用分层方法预测粗略和密集级别的变换。此方法可以应用于表面重网格化，并能从2D无缝推广到3D。

Result: 与先前的方法相比，该方法在广泛的简单和复杂密度分布上表现出更好的密度均衡和双射特性。它能够轻松应用于具有不同效果的表面重网格化，并且无需对模型架构或损失公式进行结构性更改即可从2D推广到3D。

Conclusion: 本工作为实际应用中的密度均衡映射计算提供了新的可能性，使其更具可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

*Sarker Miraz Mahfuz,Thomas Slawig*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: The paper uses precomputed steady states from a global marine ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping via CVAE, which accelerates spin-up process with 50-95% reduction in computing time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the computing time required for spin-up in global marine ecosystem models by using machine learning techniques.

Method: Employed a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction to map biogeochemical model parameters onto converged steady annual cycles, and used these predictions as initial values for spin-up.

Result: CVAE predictions provided reasonable approximations of steady states and significantly reduced the number of iterations needed for spin-up (50-95%), depending on stopping criteria. Using the mean of training data also accelerated spin-up but to a lesser extent.

Conclusion: Using CVAE predictions as initial values greatly reduces spin-up time in global marine ecosystem models compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Conclusion: 多尺度损失函数在训练概率机器学习天气预报模型方面表现出色，为未来进行尺度感知的模型训练提供了新的思路和方向。

Abstract: We assess the impact of a multi-scale loss formulation for training
probabilistic machine-learned weather forecasting models. The multi-scale loss
is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed
at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is
trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability
score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability
without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions
for future work in scale-aware model training.

*Zhecheng Liu,Jeff D. Eldredge*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transformer-based reinforcement learning framework for aerodynamic lift regulation in gust sequences via pitch control, demonstrating its superiority over linear control and generalizability to different configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linear flow control strategies may be ineffective under strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions, prompting the need for a more effective control strategy.

Method: A transformer-based reinforcement learning framework is developed, leveraging pretraining with an expert policy (linear control) and task-level transfer learning. The method focuses on regulating aerodynamic lift through pitch control using limited surface pressure sensors.

Result: The learned strategy outperforms the best proportional control, with better performance as the number of gusts increases. It generalizes effectively to arbitrarily long gust sequences and shows superior lift regulation with less control effort at quarter-chord pitching compared to mid-chord pitching.

Conclusion: The transformer-based RL framework successfully addresses flow control challenges, showing generalizability across multiple configurations and offering potential for solving more computationally demanding problems.

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

*Rui Zhang,Qi Meng,Han Wan,Yang Liu,Zhi-Ming Ma,Hao Sun*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: OmniFluids is a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning, enabling fast inference and accurate prediction under limited or zero data supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional computational fluid dynamics methods have prohibitive computational costs due to reliance on fine spatial and temporal meshes. Existing deep learning techniques such as PINNs and neural operators have their own limitations like extensive retraining, need for large labeled datasets, or instability when balancing coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements.

Method: OmniFluids uses a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers for efficient and scalable modeling of diverse physical tasks while maintaining integration with physics-based supervision. It involves physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning.

Result: OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy across various 2D and 3D benchmarks. It delivers 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers and accurately recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data.

Conclusion: OmniFluids establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling

Result: Identified three primary modes of AI contribution to creative processes: Support, Synergy, and Symbiosis.

Conclusion: These modes have different implications on levels of creativity and raise theoretical, ethical, and design considerations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Result: 发现参与式和共同设计方法在促进技术的有效使用和社会参与方面起着重要作用，并强调了公平设计实践和包容性评估策略的必要性。

Conclusion: GAI具有支持动态和个性化互动的潜力，但需要更加关注公平的设计实践和包容性的评估策略。

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

TL;DR: This paper explores how to use a neuromorphic network, based on memristive elements, to learn and model dynamical systems through autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dynamical systems can be learned and modeled using a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system.

Method: Simulating and evaluating a neuromorphic network based on memristive elements within a reservoir computing framework for the autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series.

Result: Optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components exploring the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing network coverage with input electrodes suppresses less conducive nonlinear responses.

Conclusion: These results offer insights into optimising practical neuromorphic network devices for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the memory retrieval capabilities of RBMs with different hidden unit distributions, revealing that standard binary-node RBMs have reduced critical capacity. Modifications like local biases and richer priors improve recall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural choices and activation functions affect the thermodynamic properties and memory retrieval capabilities of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs).

Method: Analyzing the phase diagram of RBMs using connections to the Hopfield model and statistical physics tools, examining various hidden unit prior distributions including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations.

Result: Standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes suffer from reduced critical capacity, but modifications such as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors restore ordered retrieval phases and enhance recall performance.

Conclusion: Hidden unit design plays a crucial role in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs, supported by theoretical findings and Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: Enzymes are crucial proteins for catalyzing chemical reactions. Although machine learning methods have been developed to predict enzyme function from sequences, there lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. This paper introduces CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for enzyme classification and retrieval tasks. It provides baselines for state-of-the-art methods in classification task and proposes CREEP as one of the first baselines for the retrieval task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating machine learning methods that predict enzyme function from sequence. By introducing CARE, the authors aim to provide a systematic way to evaluate different models' performance on enzyme classification and retrieval tasks.

Method: CARE focuses on two main tasks: (1) classification of protein sequences by their EC number and (2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, train-test splits are designed to assess out-of-distribution generalization relevant to real use cases. The classification task includes baselines for state-of-the-art methods, while for the retrieval task, the authors propose CREEP as one of the first baselines and compare it with CLIPZyme.

Result: CARE successfully establishes a benchmark and dataset suite for enzyme classification and retrieval tasks. Baselines for both tasks are provided, allowing for the evaluation of different models' performance. The proposed CREEP method shows promising results in the retrieval task.

Conclusion: This paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of standardized benchmarks like CARE for evaluating machine learning methods in predicting enzyme functions. The introduction of CARE and CREEP contributes significantly to advancing research in this area.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

### [287] [Identifying critical residues of a protein using meaningfully-thresholded Random Geometric Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10015)
*Chuqiao Zhang,Sarath Chandra Dantu,Debarghya Mitra,Dalia Chakrabarty*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper proposes three methods to identify critical residues of a protein based on learning a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, and compares the results with experimentally-ascertained critical residues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identification of critical residues is essential for understanding protein function.

Method: 1. Use organic thresholding to learn an RGG and compare it with extant thresholding techniques.
2. Develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between posterior probabilities of graph variables.
3. Parametrize criticality based on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees during molecular dynamical simulations.

Result: The three proposed methods were used to identify critical residues, and their results were compared against experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Conclusion: The study presents three novel ways to recognize critical residues in proteins using RGG-based approaches.

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

### [288] [Fundamental Limits of Learning High-dimensional Simplices in Noisy Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10101)
*Seyed Amir Hossein Saberi,Amir Najafi,Abolfazl Motahari,Babak H. khalaj*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper establishes sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices in noisy data. It proves an algorithm's existence that outputs a simplex close to the true one under certain conditions and derives new information-theoretic lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sample complexity required to learn high-dimensional simplices from noisy data, and to resolve an open question regarding the alignment of noisy-case complexity with the noiseless case when SNR is sufficiently high.

Method: The authors use sample compression techniques and introduce a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy observations to prove the existence of an algorithm that can estimate a simplex within a specified distance from the true simplex. They also derive new information-theoretic lower bounds for simplex estimation.

Result: An algorithm exists that can output a simplex within a specified distance from the true simplex given a sufficient number of samples. New lower bounds are derived showing the minimum number of samples required for simplex estimation within a certain TV distance. The noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case when SNR is sufficiently high.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by providing sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices in noisy data, resolving an open question about the relationship between noisy and noiseless case complexities.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

*Panagiotis Theodoropoulos,Augustinos D. Saravanos,Evangelos A. Theodorou,Guan-Horng Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Momentum Multi-Marginal Schrödinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM), a novel framework for learning smooth measure-valued splines in stochastic systems with multiple positional constraints, which improves capturing long-range temporal dependencies and coherence of inferred trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methodologies for inferring trajectories from sparse sample snapshots rely on pairwise interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This limits their ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies and affects the coherence of the inferred trajectories.

Method: The 3MSBM framework lifts dynamics to phase space and generalizes stochastic bridges conditioned on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal control problem. The underlying dynamics are learned by minimizing a variational objective with the path induced by the multi-marginal conditional bridge fixed.

Result: Extensive experimentation shows that 3MSBM outperforms existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies.

Conclusion: 3MSBM offers a significant improvement in capturing long-range temporal dependencies and preserving intermediate marginals throughout training, opening new possibilities for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings.

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

TL;DR: The paper explores the continuum from adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning through distributionally constrained adversaries, providing insights into learnability and generalizing known smoothed settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between adversarial and stochastic settings in online learning and understand the interplay between function classes and distributional constraints on adversaries that enable learnability.

Method: Consider a framework of distributionally constrained adversaries where instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some constrained distribution class. Characterize which distribution classes are learnable against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries.

Result: Provide insights into the types of interplay between function class and distributional constraints on adversaries that enable learnability. Results recover and generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Show that for several natural function classes, learning can be achieved without prior knowledge of the distribution class.

Conclusion: The framework of distributionally constrained adversaries offers a more general and flexible approach to understanding the continuum from adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

TL;DR: 研究人员提出了一种基于信息论的方法，用于测量在扩散模型生成过程中何时做出类别语义决策，并通过条件熵和其时间导数来确定信息传递的关键时段。实验表明，语义信息传递主要发生在扩散的中间阶段，且不同类别的决策时间有所不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已知图像的语义和结构特征在扩散逆过程的不同时间出现，但目前缺乏一种通用方法来精确测量这些语义决策发生的时间点。因此，本文旨在引入一种新的信息理论方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过使用贝叶斯分类器的在线公式，估计给定噪声状态下的类别标签的条件熵；然后利用条件熵的时间导数确定噪声状态与类别标签之间信息传递最高的时间段；最后在高斯混合模型和DDPM模型上验证该方法。

Result: 发现语义信息传递在扩散的中间阶段最高，在后期几乎消失；并且不同类别的熵率分布存在显著差异，表明各类别的“语义决策”发生在不同的中间时间点。

Conclusion: 所提出的信息论方法能够有效测量扩散生成过程中语义决策的发生时间，并揭示了不同类别在生成过程中的语义决策时间差异。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

*Kyohei Atarashi,Satoshi Oyama,Hiromi Arai,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes the box-constrained softmax (BCSoftmax) function, a generalization of Softmax that enforces lower and upper bounds on output probabilities. It also introduces two post-hoc calibration methods based on BCSoftmax to enhance model reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the limitation of the traditional Softmax function which lacks the ability to enforce hard constraints like box constraints on output probabilities, making it unreliable for certain applications requiring trustworthy models.

Method: Propose the BCSoftmax function as a novel generalization of the Softmax function with explicit enforcement of lower and upper bounds on output probabilities. Develop an exact and efficient computation algorithm for BCSoftmax and introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on BCSoftmax to mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive models by learning the lower and upper bounds after model training.

Result: Experimental results using TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets show improvements in calibration metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: BCSoftmax function and its associated post-hoc calibration methods provide a reliable way to control output probabilities, thus enhancing the trustworthiness of predictive models.

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

*Maxime Haddouche,Otmane Sakhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper explores adaptive off-policy learning, extending PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing to an adaptive scenario for iteratively refining and re-deploying policies. The adjusted method matches static offline approaches' performance and outperforms them when intermediate policy deployments are allowed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to move beyond traditional off-policy learning under a static behavior policy to an adaptive off-policy learning setting, where policies can be iteratively refined and redeployed for collecting higher-quality data.

Method: The method builds on PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) and extends it to the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. An adjustment to the LS estimator accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates under mild conditions.

Result: The method matches the performance of leading offline approaches in static settings and significantly outperforms them when intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations show advantages of adaptive data collection and strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Conclusion: Adaptive off-policy learning with the adjusted PAC-Bayesian framework offers significant improvements over static off-policy methods, particularly when intermediate policy deployments are utilized.

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A/B testing is a common method for evaluating potential improvements of a new decision system compared to a baseline, but the commonly used difference-in-means estimator can be improved upon.

Method: Introduced a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieve lower variance than the standard approach, identifying within this family the estimator with the lowest variance.

Result: The proposed estimator offers substantial variance reduction, particularly effective when the two tested systems exhibit similarities.

Conclusion: The theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit

TL;DR: The paper explores causal effect estimation with hidden confounders using nonparametric IV regression, analyzing the role of spectral features and providing a taxonomy of outcomes based on spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders, employing nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression to understand the effectiveness of spectral features.

Method: Derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator using spectral features, examining how performance depends on spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay.

Result: Performance depends on two key factors: spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay. Outcomes can be classified into three scenarios: good (optimal performance), bad (degraded performance due to rapid eigenvalue decay), and ugly (failure due to weak spectral alignment). Synthetic experiments validate this taxonomy.

Conclusion: Spectral features play a crucial role in causal effect estimation, and their effectiveness is contingent upon strong spectral alignment and appropriate eigenvalue characteristics.

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

Motivation: 探索无分类器引导(CFG)在掩码离散扩散模型中的作用机制，理解其如何影响采样行为和输出分布。

Method: 假设无分数误差和离散化误差，推导出引导反向动力学的显式解；分析当数据分布为类别混合时，引导如何放大特定类别的区域并抑制共享区域；研究引导强度$w$对采样分布协方差结构的影响以及在1D和2D情况下的行为差异。

Result: 发现引导不仅塑造输出分布，还控制采样轨迹的动力学；对于大$w$，总变差(TV)沿反向动力学的衰减率在1D和2D中均呈双指数依赖于$w$。

Conclusion: 无分类器引导在扩散模型中不仅影响输出分布形状，还深刻影响采样轨迹的动力学特性，其效果因维度和引导强度而异。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

*Xiaolin Hu,Qinghua Zhou,Bogdan Grechuk,Ivan Y. Tyukin*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) face limitations due to the absence of natural language interfaces. Although advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved autoformalization, existing methods lack sentence-level verification capabilities. This paper proposes StepProof, a new method for granular, step-by-step verification that breaks down proofs into subproofs, significantly improving proof success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of current autoformalization approaches which are only able to verify complete proofs and do not support finer, sentence-level verification.

Method: Propose StepProof, an autoformalization method that breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs to enable sentence-level verification.

Result: Experimental results indicate that StepProof greatly enhances proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Minor manual modifications to natural language proofs further improve StepProof's performance.

Conclusion: StepProof addresses the gap in existing autoformalization by enabling granular, step-by-step verification, leading to significant improvements in proof verification success rates and efficiency.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data by providing a comprehensive benchmark evaluation.

Method: Evaluation of 19 SSL methods across 9 datasets focusing on batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality prediction tasks. Systematic assessment of various data augmentation strategies.

Result: Specialized frameworks like scVI excel at uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods perform better in cell typing and multi-modal data integration. Random masking is the most effective augmentation technique.

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench provides a standardized platform for evaluating SSL in single-cell analysis, advancing deep learning and single-cell genomics convergence.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

TL;DR: Genomic language models (gLMs) have potential in generating functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology. The study introduces Nullsettes tasks to evaluate a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations. Across 12 state-of-the-art models, mutation effect prediction performance correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant and is dependent on sequence length.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of genomic language models in predicting loss-of-function mutations by translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes.

Method: Introduced a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes and evaluated 12 state-of-the-art models on their mutation effect prediction performance.

Result: Mutation effect prediction performance strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant and is highly dependent on sequence length.

Conclusion: When using gLMs for mutation effect prediction, it is important to consider both sequence likelihood and sequence length.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for identifying homogeneous subsets (subcohorts) within large inhomogeneous datasets, particularly for applications in medical research such as finding specific disease pathways and therapeutics.

Method: Designing an algorithm that outputs a linear classifier using a rounding technique similar to Goemans and Williamson's approach to approximate the optimal solution within a factor of 0.82. Applying this algorithm to breast cancer RNA microarray dataset for identifying subcohorts with metastatic cases and systematic changes in methylation levels and nuclear receptor expression.

Result: Successfully identified homogeneous subcohorts of patients mainly comprised of metastatic cases and subcohorts where statistically significant changes in methylation levels co-occur with changes in nuclear receptor expression.

Conclusion: Identifying homogeneous subcohorts through the proposed algorithm can aid in discovering disease pathways and developing therapeutics specific to these subcohorts.

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the learning experience in online settings by providing personalized answers to learners' questions, thereby increasing engagement and decreasing the burden on educators.

Method: A framework and dataset were developed using the StackExchange platform in two areas (language learning and programming). Personalized answers were generated using different strategies including 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The answers were evaluated using BERTScore, LLM evaluation, and human evaluation.

Result: Providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from the learner or similar learners) significantly enhances their ability to tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Conclusion: LLMs have great potential to generate personalized answers for learners in online education settings, improving the overall learning experience.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.
