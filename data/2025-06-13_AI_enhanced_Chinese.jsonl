When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then\noffers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of\nunderdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility.

Meanwhile,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face\nsignificant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning\nabilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and\nbeing limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To\novercome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM\n(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node\ndescription, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured\nnatural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which\nencodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained\nlanguage models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared\nto directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph\nrepresentation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a\nshared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph\nFoundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised\nperformance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and\ndemonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Graphs are crucial for modeling complex interactions.

This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,\nblack-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can\nbe highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require\nsignificant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address\nthese challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We\ninterpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to\nuse a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.\nThis novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both\nthe model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also\nincorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.\nTo perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data\nmodalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a\nnovel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt\noptimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey\nmodification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively\non closed-source models.

However, it faces\npractical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must\nbe transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR\ndevice's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed\nand delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and\nworsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic\nCommunication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service\n(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic\ntransmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction.

As a result, the\ncybersecurity community is shifting focus towards more persistent behavioral\nprofiles, such as the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and the\nsoftware used by a threat group. However, the distinctiveness and completeness\nof such behavioral profiles remain largely unexplored. In this work, we\nsystematically analyze threat group profiles built from two open cyber threat\nintelligence (CTI) knowledge bases: MITRE ATT&CK and Malpedia. We first\ninvestigate what fraction of threat groups have group-specific behaviors, i.e.,\nbehaviors used exclusively by a single group. We find that only 34% of threat\ngroups in ATT&CK have group-specific techniques. The software used by a threat\ngroup proves to be more distinctive, with 73% of ATT&CK groups using\ngroup-specific software. However, this percentage drops to 24% in the broader\nMalpedia dataset. Next, we evaluate how group profiles improve when data from\nboth sources are combined. While coverage improves modestly, the proportion of\ngroups with group-specific behaviors remains under 30%. We then enhance\nprofiles by adding exploited vulnerabilities and additional techniques\nextracted from more threat reports.

To enhance its ability to\ncapture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we\nembed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale\nfeature extraction.\n  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial\nhidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in\nrecurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling\nstress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed\ninput-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations\nand exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular\nsampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate\nHANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive\nanisotropic damage in brittle solids.

In\nrecent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms\nof expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally\ndifficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be\nable to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity\nproblem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)\nidentical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training\ndata with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these\nassumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught\nattention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by\nsuch shifts to the best of our knowledge.

Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification\nproblem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or\ninvolve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the\npersistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource\nlinguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy\npseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods\nthat rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading\narchitectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling\nhigh-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can\ndramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically\ndiverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label\nrefinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies\nby identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This\ncomponent specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an\ninitial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an\nadaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial\nfor mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,\nallowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a\nhandful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse\ndatasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,\nand Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and\nadaptability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFlick\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlick\u572814\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u3001\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u548c\u585e\u8328\u74e6\u7eb3\u8bed\u7b49\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u9488\u5bf9\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u82f1\u8bed\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Flick\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7cbe\u70bc\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u521d\u59cb\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u805a\u7c7b\u51dd\u805a\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94top-k\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "Flick\u5728\u5305\u542b\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u8bed\u3001\u4e4c\u5c14\u90fd\u8bed\u3001\u585e\u8328\u74e6\u7eb3\u8bed\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u5185\u768414\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Flick\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7cbe\u70bc\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This raises a natural\nquestion: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that\nsupport near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space\nsequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --\nstate space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the\nclassic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation\noperator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),\nby relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially\nnon-associative) functions such as softmax attention.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention.

While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study\nexamines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from\ndyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level\nprosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions\n(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker\ndisplacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness\nshowed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed\ngestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for\nprosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower\nand more context sensitive correlations.

In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields\nsuch as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.\nTraditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for\ndiffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted\nenergy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several\nchallenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping\nartifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when\nextended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy\nformulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based\ndensity-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.\nSpecifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and\ngeometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the\ntransformations at both the coarse and dense levels.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints.

Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures.

In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic\napproach to measure when these class-semantic \"decisions\" are made during the\ngenerative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian\nclassifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the\nnoisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest\ninformation transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time\nderivative of the conditional entropy.

Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct\napplicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for\ntext-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion\nMamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal\ninformation and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token\nre-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%\ncompared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at\n768$\\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality\ndegradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a\nreward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.\nExtensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to\nproduce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.\nCode and models will be publicly available at\nhttps://huangjch526.github.io/M4V_project.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for efficient text-to-video generation that reduces computational costs while maintaining high video quality.", "motivation": "Text-to-video generation is computationally demanding due to the vast spatiotemporal space and quadratic complexity in sequence processing when using Transformers.
