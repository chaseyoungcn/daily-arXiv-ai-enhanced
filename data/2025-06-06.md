### [1] [Zero-Shot Adaptation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04244)
*Farzad Farhadzadeh,Debasmit Das,Shubhankar Borse,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProLoRA is a method for zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models, transferring pre-trained low-rank adjustments without additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional methods that require retraining when switching base models, which can be challenging due to data constraints.

Method: ProLoRA transfers pre-trained low-rank adjustments from a source to a target model through projection into the target model's weight space, using subspace and null space similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers.

Result: Evaluations on established text-to-image models show successful knowledge transfer and comparable performance without retraining.

Conclusion: ProLoRA enables zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models, overcoming the need for retraining when changing base models.

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在自主代理为用户做决策的时代，确保情境完整性（CI）成为关键问题。研究提出CI需要代理对其运行环境进行推理，并通过提示大语言模型（LLMs）明确推理CI以及开发强化学习框架来实现这一目标。使用约700个样例的合成数据集，该方法显著减少了不恰当的信息披露，同时保持任务性能，且效果可迁移到PrivacyLens等基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理替用户做决策的时代到来，确保情境完整性（Contextual Integrity, CI）成为重要问题，即在执行特定任务时应分享哪些适当信息。这促使研究者探索如何让代理具备推理能力以应对不同情境和信息披露规范。

Method: 1. 提示大语言模型（LLMs）明确推理CI以决定披露哪些信息。
2. 开发强化学习（RL）框架，进一步将实现CI所需的推理能力灌输给模型。
3. 使用一个包含约700个样例的合成数据集进行训练，该数据集涵盖多样情境和信息披露规范。

Result: 该方法显著减少了不恰当的信息披露，同时在多个模型大小和家族中保持了任务性能。此外，改进效果能够从合成数据集迁移到具有人工标注的PrivacyLens等已建立的CI基准测试。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结合显式推理和强化学习方法，可以有效减少代理在执行任务时的不当信息披露，同时维持任务性能，验证了所提出方法的有效性与迁移能力。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

### [4] [A Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework Enhances Decision-Making in the Circular Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04252)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Dusit Niyato,Chuan Fu Tan,Keyi Xiang,Yueyang Wang,Zhiquan Yeo,Daren Tan Zong Loong,Jonathan Low Zhaozhi,Eugene H. Z. HO*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG is a RAG framework that improves LLMs' accuracy and efficiency in sustainable manufacturing by using a domain-specific knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have potential in sustainable manufacturing but often generate inaccurate industrial codes and emission factors, which can negatively impact regulatory and investment decisions.

Method: CircuGraphRAG uses a knowledge graph with 117,380 industrial and waste entities, connected with classification codes and GWP100 emission data. It translates natural language queries into SPARQL and retrieves verified subgraphs for accurate and traceable responses.

Result: CircuGraphRAG outperforms Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG in single-hop and multi-hop question answering with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0. It also improves efficiency by halving response time and reducing token usage by 16% in certain tasks.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable and low-carbon resource decision making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

### [5] [HADA: Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04253)
*Tapio Pitkäranta,Leena Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces HADA, a protocol- and framework agnostic reference architecture that aligns LLM agents and legacy algorithms with organizational targets and values. It wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents and expresses alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints in natural language. The cloud-native proof of concept packages a production credit-scoring model and deploys it on Docker/Kubernetes/Python. Evaluation showed complete coverage of six predefined objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a system that keeps both large language model (LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and values, using a protocol- and framework agnostic approach.

Method: HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents -- business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing conversational APIs. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and versioned.

Result: Evaluation followed the Design-Science Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage.

Conclusion: Contributions include an open-source HADA architecture, a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in multi-agent systems, and empirical evidence that framework-agnostic, protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

### [6] [Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and Iterative Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04287)
*Yongjin Yang,Sinjae Kang,Juyong Lee,Dongjun Lee,Se-Young Yun,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes EXIF, a novel automatic skill discovery framework for LLM-powered agents. It uses an exploration-first strategy with an exploration agent (Alice) generating a skill dataset to train the target agent (Bob). A closed-loop data generation process improves Bob's capabilities iteratively without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLM agents to perform diverse tasks is challenging due to difficulties in creating effective training datasets. Manual creation requires significant effort, while LLM-proposed tasks may not be feasible or meaningful.

Method: EXIF employs an exploration agent (Alice) to interact with the environment and generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset. This dataset trains the target agent (Bob). An iterative feedback loop allows Alice to evaluate Bob's performance and guide further exploration, forming a closed-loop data generation process.

Result: Experiments on Webshop and Crafter show that EXIF effectively discovers meaningful skills and enhances the trained agent's capabilities significantly without human intervention. Notably, using the same model for Alice and Bob improves performance, indicating potential for self-evolving systems.

Conclusion: EXIF addresses challenges in skill acquisition for LLM-powered agents by providing a method to automatically discover meaningful skills through an exploration-first strategy and closed-loop feedback system.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

### [7] [A Statistical Physics of Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04374)
*Jack David Carson,Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformer语言模型展示了一种难以用机械方式理解的新兴推理能力。本文提供了一个连续时间链式思考推理动态的统计物理学框架，通过低维流形上的随机动力系统来模拟句子级别的隐藏状态轨迹，并利用潜在的状态转换捕捉不同的推理阶段。该框架可以进行低成本的推理模拟，有助于研究和预测关键转变，如错位状态或其他LM故障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Transformer语言模型中的推理过程复杂且难以理解，因此需要一个能够解析其推理动态的新框架。

Method: 将句子级别的隐藏状态轨迹建模为低维流形上的随机动力系统，使用具有潜在状态转换的漂移-扩散系统捕捉多样化的推理阶段，包括错位状态或失败。对8个模型和7个基准进行的经验轨迹分析显示，秩40投影可以解释约50%的方差，发现了四个潜在的推理阶段，并提出了SLDS模型来捕获这些特征。

Result: 该方法成功识别了四种潜在的推理阶段，并验证了SLDS模型的有效性，证明它可以解释经验轨迹的主要变化并模拟推理过程。

Conclusion: 提出的统计物理框架为研究和预测语言模型推理动态提供了新的工具，特别是对于关键转变如错位状态或其他LM故障有重要价值。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

### [8] [Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410)
*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents Matter-of-Fact, a dataset for evaluating hypothesis feasibility in scientific discovery. It includes 8.4k claims from materials science topics. Baselines using retrieval-augmented generation and code generation achieve only 72% accuracy, indicating the task's difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of running numerous automated experiments by filtering hypotheses based on their feasibility, thus improving the efficiency and likelihood of significant discoveries in scientific research.

Method: Introduced the Matter-of-Fact dataset with 8.4k claims from scientific articles across four materials science topics. Evaluated strong baselines that include retrieval-augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation to determine the feasibility of these claims.

Result: The baseline models achieved an accuracy of 72%, which is higher than chance performance (50%), but domain-expert verification suggests that nearly all claims are solvable, emphasizing the challenge for current models.

Conclusion: Matter-of-Fact highlights the difficulty of assessing hypothesis feasibility with current models and shows potential for accelerating scientific discovery if near-term progress can be made.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

### [9] [Plugging Schema Graph into Multi-Table QA: A Human-Guided Framework for Reducing LLM Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04427)
*Xixi Wang,Miguel Costa,Jordanka Kovaceva,Shuai Wang,Francisco C. Pereira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a graph-based framework for multi-table QA using LLMs, leveraging human-curated relational knowledge to encode schema links and join paths, demonstrating effectiveness on complex industrial tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for table QA struggle with multi-table scenarios due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables, especially in real-world situations with diverse columns.

Method: The proposed method uses a graph-based framework that incorporates human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. It constructs interpretable reasoning chains from natural language queries by searching this graph, enhanced by pruning and sub-path merging strategies for efficiency and coherence.

Result: Experiments on both standard benchmarks and a realistic large-scale dataset show the effectiveness of the approach in handling complex industrial tabular data.

Conclusion: The authors claim this is the first multi-table QA system successfully applied to truly complex industrial tabular data, highlighting the potential of their graph-based framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

*Ananya Joshi,Nolan Gormley,Richa Gadgil,Tina Townes,Roni Rosenfeld,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a ranking-based monitoring paradigm using AI anomaly detection methods to handle large volumes of health data, showing significant improvement in monitoring objectives and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health experts require scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of health data for outbreaks or data quality issues, as traditional alert-based systems struggle with modern data monitoring challenges.

Method: The method involves a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that leverages new AI anomaly detection methods, which has been deployed at a national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily.

Result: A three-month longitudinal evaluation showed a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency compared to traditional alert-based methods.

Conclusion: This work emphasizes the potential of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

### [11] [Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478)
*Hadi Hosseini,Samarth Khanna,Ronak Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains, especially in matching markets. Despite improvements from parameter-efficient fine-tuning, LLMs still struggle with large markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and evaluate the limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs in processing ranked preferences and structured algorithms within combinatorial domains like matching markets.

Method: Evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on tasks such as stable-matching generation, instability detection, resolution, and preference queries in matching markets. Use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) to attempt improvement.

Result: LLMs struggle significantly with resolving instability in large markets, failing often to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. LoRA improves performance in small markets but not in large ones.

Conclusion: There is a need for more sophisticated strategies to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities with larger-context inputs.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Wei Dai,Cheng Cheng,Jinze Wu,Jing Sha,Song Li,Qi Liu,Shijin Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An analysis on the evaluation of LLMs' mathematical abilities through a new framework called CogMath, revealing overestimated capabilities and providing insights for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating LLMs in mathematical tasks only focus on overall answer accuracy, which is insufficient to assess their true capabilities.

Method: Propose CogMath, a framework inspired by human cognition that formalizes reasoning into three stages (problem comprehension, problem solving, solution summarization) with 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. Use a multi-agent system ('Inquiry-Judge-Reference') to generate inquiries assessing mastery from these dimensions.

Result: CogMath reveals that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs are overestimated by 30%-40%. It also identifies their strengths and weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions.

Conclusion: The proposed CogMath framework provides a more comprehensive assessment of LLMs' mathematical abilities and offers insights for enhancing their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

*Aladin Djuhera,Amin Seffo,Masataro Asai,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为STPR的约束生成框架，利用大语言模型将自然语言表达的复杂约束转化为可执行的Python函数，用于机器人导航规划问题。实验表明，该方法能够准确描述复杂数学约束，并在模拟环境中确保多种约束和场景下的完全合规性，同时运行时间短，且适用于小型代码专用语言模型。


<details>

Motivation: 近期大语言模型的发展促使了对机器人导航的兴趣，特别是将复杂的自然语言空间、数学和条件约束纳入规划问题中。然而，这些约束往往是非正式且高度复杂的，难以转换为规划算法可以接受的形式化描述。

Method: 提出STPR框架，利用大语言模型将自然语言中的约束（尤其是“不要做什么”的指令）转化为可执行的Python函数。通过LLM的强大编码能力，将问题描述从自然语言转换为结构化和透明的代码，从而绕过复杂的推理并避免潜在的幻觉。生成的函数被应用于点云表示的传统搜索算法中。

Result: 实验在Gazebo模拟环境中进行，结果表明STPR能够确保在多个约束和场景下的完全合规性，同时具有较短的运行时间。此外，验证了STPR可以与较小的代码专用LLM结合使用，降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: STPR框架能够有效解决复杂约束到可执行代码的转换问题，在机器人导航规划中表现出高效性和准确性，同时适用于多种大小的语言模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

TL;DR: This paper presents DeePoly, a novel framework for solving PDEs that combines DNNs and polynomial basis functions to enhance accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning methods, especially DNNs, have become popular in scientific computing for solving PDEs. However, they often lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes.

Method: DeePoly transforms the solution paradigm into a two-stage approach: using a DNN to capture complex global features, followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features (Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper).

Result: Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that this method significantly improves high-order accuracy and efficiency across various problem types while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties.

Conclusion: DeePoly leverages the strengths of both DNNs and polynomial bases to provide a more accurate and efficient solution for PDEs, serving as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

*Yuyang Wanyan,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Haowei Liu,Junyang Wang,Jiabo Ye,Yutong Kou,Ming Yan,Fei Huang,Xiaoshan Yang,Weiming Dong,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been used for GUI automation tasks, which require step-by-step decision-making in online interactive environments. Errors in this process can lead to irreversible outcomes. To address this, the paper introduces a pre-operative critic mechanism with Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy, resulting in GUI-Critic-R1 model. The model provides reliable feedback by reasoning about potential outcomes and correctness of actions. Additionally, a reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline was developed to create GUI-Critic-Train and GUI-Critic-Test datasets. Experiments show that GUI-Critic-R1 has significant advantages in critic accuracy compared to current MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the reliability and effectiveness of GUI automation tasks performed by MLLMs in online interactive environments, where errors can lead to irreversible outcomes. A pre-operative critic mechanism is needed to provide effective feedback prior to actual execution.

Method: The method involves proposing a Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct the pre-operative critic model GUI-Critic-R1. This incorporates a novel suggestion reward to enhance the reliability of the model's feedback. Additionally, a reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline was developed to create GUI-Critic-Train and GUI-Critic-Test datasets.

Result: Static experiments on GUI-Critic-Test across mobile and web domains reveal that GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation benchmark shows improved success rates and operational efficiency, highlighting the model's effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: The introduction of the pre-operative critic mechanism with the S-GRPO strategy has led to the development of GUI-Critic-R1, which significantly improves critic accuracy and operational efficiency in GUI automation tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

### [19] [CHANCERY: Evaluating corporate governance reasoning capabilities in language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04636)
*Lucas Irwin,Arda Kaz,Peiyao Sheng,Pramod Viswanath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHANCERY, a new corporate governance reasoning benchmark designed to test language models' ability to reason about whether executive/board/shareholder actions align with corporate governance charters. It's based on 24 concrete principles and 79 real-life charters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the lack of legal datasets focusing specifically on reasoning tasks in the domain of law, which is crucial for real-world legal practice. The authors aim to fill this gap by creating a benchmark that tests models' reasoning abilities in the context of corporate governance.

Method: The method involves creating a benchmark called CHANCERY which consists of a corporate charter and a proposal for executive action. Models must perform binary classification to determine if the proposed action complies with the charter rules. The benchmark is built using established corporate governance principles and real-life corporate charters.

Result: State-of-the-art reasoning models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o achieve accuracies of 64.5% and 75.2% respectively. Reasoning agents based on ReAct and CodeAct frameworks score higher at 76.1% and 78.1%, demonstrating advanced legal reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The CHANCERY benchmark confirms its difficulty for current SOTA models, highlighting areas where these models struggle in legal reasoning. This provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of SOTA models in handling complex legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在许多任务中表现出色，但在制定和遵循连贯的长期策略方面仍然存在困难。因此，研究者希望探讨LLM代理在挑战其战略规划能力的环境中是否能够自我改进。

Method: 使用开源Catanatron框架下的Settlers of Catan棋盘游戏，构建从简单游戏代理到能自主重写自身提示和玩家代理代码的系统。引入多代理架构，包括分析员、研究员、编码员和玩家等专门角色，他们共同分析游戏玩法、研究新策略并修改代理逻辑或提示。

Result: 由Claude 3.7和GPT-4o等模型驱动的自进化代理，在自主采用策略、将样本行为传递给游戏代理以及多次迭代中展示适应性推理方面，优于静态基线。

Conclusion: 自进化代理能够在战略规划任务中有效诊断失败并随时间适应，显示出比固定策略更强的能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Motivation: To address the lack of quantitative safety analysis for e-bikes due to unstructured incident reports, this study aims to use LLM-powered agents to classify and extract safety variables from these reports.

Method: The study introduces E-bike agents, a framework with four LLM agents handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause determination, and component linkage. An ordered logit model is also used to examine the relationship between incident severity and retrieved factors.

Result: The model achieved a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in classification accuracy, identifying that equipment issues are slightly more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often fatal. Pedals, tires, and brakes were frequent contributors to accidents.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs for extracting unstructured data in niche domains like transportation, offering a scalable solution for improving e-bike safety analytics.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

TL;DR: 强化学习（RL）对语言模型推理能力的提升不仅仅是准确性，还涉及计划执行、问题分解和知识利用等方面。研究表明，RL可能更侧重于增强模型内部策略制定与知识整合能力，而非单纯依赖外部计划。此外，通过开发新方法利用难题改进训练过程，为更系统化的推理模型训练与评估奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于强化学习（RL）的训练方法（如GRPO）在经验上取得了显著成果，但对其优势的具体理解仍显不足，尤其是RL如何影响语言模型的推理能力。因此，研究者希望引入一种细致的分析框架，深入探讨RL在提升计划执行、问题分解及推理与知识利用方面的作用。

Method: 研究者设计了一个细粒度的分析框架，用于剖析强化学习对语言模型推理能力的影响。该框架重点研究了三个关键要素：1) 计划遵循与执行；2) 问题分解；3) 提升推理能力和知识利用效率。通过这一框架，研究者能够超越单纯的准确率指标，深入了解RL在不同任务中的具体作用机制。

Result: 研究表明，提供明确的分步计划反而会降低模型在最具挑战性基准上的表现，而经过RL调优的模型表现出更强的鲁棒性，性能下降幅度明显小于基础模型。这表明RL可能并非主要增强模型对外部计划的执行能力，而是帮助模型制定和遵循更适合其推理过程的内部策略。同时，RL增强了模型将给定知识整合到推理过程中的能力，在各种任务中均取得性能提升。此外，研究还展示了通过开发新方法利用难题来改进训练过程的可能性。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了强化学习对语言模型推理能力的多方面影响，特别是其在内部策略制定和知识整合方面的潜力。这些发现为未来更系统化地训练和评估推理模型提供了理论基础和指导方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

TL;DR: The Deepseek-R1-Distill series reasoning models, while powerful in many domains, have benchmark evaluation results that fluctuate significantly due to various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation conditions can cause substantial variations in results, a phenomenon also observed in other similar models like QwQ-32B. This makes reliable reproduction of their claimed performance improvements difficult.

Motivation: To address the issue of significant fluctuations in benchmark evaluation results of reasoning models such as the Deepseek-R1-Distill series, which affects the reliability of performance improvement claims.

Method: Empirical assessment of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models and analysis of the impact of various factors on their benchmark evaluation results. Comparison with other open-source inference models and the QwQ-32B model.

Result: Substantial variations in evaluation results are caused by subtle differences in evaluation conditions. Performance improvements in similar models are difficult to reproduce reliably.

Conclusion: A more rigorous paradigm for model performance evaluation is needed to ensure reliable and consistent results.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样化的连续控制任务中显著优于非自适应方法，能够在满足安全要求的同时优化性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在安全关键任务上实现了稳健的性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

*Julien Soulé,Jean-Paul Jamont,Michel Occello,Paul Théron,Louis-Marie Traonouez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper uses Markovian modeling and simulation to study the interaction between cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents in a network system, providing an experimental framework for coordinated cyber-attack scenarios and evaluation of cyber-defense dynamic organizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As cyber-attacks become increasingly complex and coordinated, there is a need for more effective strategies for cyber-defense, especially at entry points in networked systems.

Method: The authors use Markovian modeling and implement a simulator that includes both cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host network nodes. Network nodes are abstracted by sets of properties including those of the agents. The model considers actions applied by agents that affect how the network reacts based on its current state and which properties should change. The collective choice of these actions determines the proximity to the goals of either the cyber-attackers or the cyber-defenders.

Result: A realistically inspired scenario was implemented using several behavior implementation approaches for both cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed experimental framework.

Conclusion: The experimental framework provides valuable insights into the dynamics of coordinated cyber-attacks and cyber-defense strategies, helping to assess and improve the organization and responsiveness of cyber-defenders.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

*Kai Wang,Yihao Zhang,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of honesty in large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning, which can involve strategic deception. Using representation engineering, they induce, detect, and control deception, achieving high detection accuracy and a significant success rate in eliciting deception without explicit prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate strategic deception in advanced LLMs that use chain-of-thought reasoning, as these models can intentionally misinform.

Method: Employing representation engineering to systematically induce, detect, and control deception in LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning. 'Deception vectors' are extracted via Linear Artificial Tomography for detection, and activation steering is used to elicit context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts.

Result: Achieved 89% detection accuracy for deception using 'deception vectors' and a 40% success rate in eliciting deception through activation steering.

Conclusion: This work highlights the specific honesty-related issues in reasoning models and provides tools to promote trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

*Jônata Tyska Carvalho,Stefano Nolfi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for LLMs to control embodied agents by mapping observation vectors to action vectors, validated on Gymnasium and MuJoCo tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language models to control embodied agents effectively by combining symbolic reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data.

Method: LLMs generate and iteratively refine a control strategy based on textual descriptions, performance feedback, and sensory-motor data collected during evaluation.

Result: Successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions in most cases for classic control tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully integrates symbolic knowledge with sub-symbolic data to control embodied agents.

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Conclusion: This work represents a step towards programmable matter and robust computing systems, being the first successful application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to develop autonomous systems that can sustain themselves in resource-volatile settings without infrastructure support or external supervision.

Method: The method involves formalizing the principle of survival-maintaining functional operation under fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions through an energy-based utility function and a viability-constrained survival horizon.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural foundation for deploying autonomous agents in settings where persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves

formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes RAG-UAV, a framework that enhances the mathematical reasoning of LLMs in UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. Experiments show incorporating retrieval increases exact answer accuracy, reduces incorrect formulation selection and numerical errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of autonomous UAV operations by enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs for tasks such as trajectory planning and power management.

Method: RAG-UAV is a retrieval-augmented generation framework designed for several LLMs in UAV-specific contexts. It provides access to relevant domain literature. The study introduces UAV-Math-Bench, a set of 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty levels, for initial assessment.

Result: Incorporating retrieval substantially increases exact answer accuracy (up to 75% with o1), reduces incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with RAG) and decreases numerical errors, reducing MSE by orders of magnitude for the best-performing models.

Conclusion: RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for engineering analysis in UAV operations, but direct real-time flight control requires further investigation.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question

### [33] [Truly Self-Improving Agents Require Intrinsic Metacognitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05109)
*Tennison Liu,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-improving agents need intrinsic metacognitive learning to overcome current limitations. A framework with three components (knowledge, planning, evaluation) is introduced. Extrinsic mechanisms limit scalability; ingredients for intrinsic metacognition already exist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agents face limitations in rigidity, generalization across tasks, and scalability with increasing capabilities.

Method: The paper introduces a formal framework inspired by human metacognition, consisting of three components: metacognitive knowledge, planning, and evaluation. It analyzes existing agents and explores the distribution of responsibilities between humans and agents.

Result: Existing self-improving agents predominantly use extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms that limit scalability and adaptability. Many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are already present.

Conclusion: To enable sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement, challenges in distributing metacognitive responsibilities and evaluating/improving intrinsic metacognitive learning must be addressed.

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LLM-First Search (LFS)的新方法，使大型语言模型能够自主控制搜索过程，无需预定义的搜索策略。在 Countdown 和 Sudoku 任务中，LFS相较于其他经典算法表现出更好的性能、更高的计算效率和更强的扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索方法（如蒙特卡洛树搜索）依赖固定的探索超参数，在不同难度的任务中适应性有限，且可能不实用或成本高昂。

Method: 提出 LLM 自主导航搜索（LLM-First Search, LFS），让 LLM 通过内部评分机制自主决定是否继续当前搜索路径或探索其他分支，无需外部启发式或硬编码策略。

Result: LFS 在更困难的任务上表现更好，无需额外调整；相比其他方法计算效率更高；随着模型增强或计算预算增加，LFS 的性能扩展更好。

Conclusion: LFS 提供了一种灵活且上下文敏感的推理方式，无需手动调优或特定任务适配，展现出在复杂推理任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

*Violet Xiang,Chase Blagden,Rafael Rafailov,Nathan Lile,Sang Truong,Chelsea Finn,Nick Haber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models can be inefficient as they generate too many tokens even for easy problems. This paper introduces Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning method that adjusts token generation based on problem difficulty, saving computational resources without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of large reasoning models which waste computation on easy problems by generating too many tokens.

Method: The method involves introducing ALP, a reinforcement learning objective that tailors generation length to per-prompt solve rate. It monitors each prompt's online solve rate and applies a differentiable penalty inversely proportional to the solve rate.

Result: Post-training with ALP reduces average token usage by 50% without significantly affecting performance. It redistributes computational resources more intelligently compared to fixed-budget and uniform penalty methods, improving accuracy on harder problems.

Conclusion: ALP successfully optimizes the use of tokens in large reasoning models, reducing computational waste on easy problems and enhancing performance on difficult ones.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of Control tax in AI Control (AIC) to measure the cost of integrating control measures into AI systems. It provides a theoretical framework, evaluates language models under adversarial settings, and offers financial cost estimates with optimized monitoring strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes applications necessitates robust oversight mechanisms. However, practical adoption depends heavily on implementation overhead, leading to the need for a better understanding of the costs involved.

Method: 1) A theoretical framework is introduced to quantify the Control Tax and map classifier performance to safety assurances; 2) Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on state-of-the-art language models in adversarial settings involving attacker and monitoring models; 3) Empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols are provided along with optimized monitoring strategies balancing safety and cost-effectiveness.

Result: The framework enables practitioners to connect safety guarantees with their costs systematically, allowing for informed decision-making in different deployment contexts.

Conclusion: This work advances AI Control by providing a principled economic feasibility assessment, offering tools for practitioners to balance safety and cost-effectiveness in real-world AI applications.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Conclusion: The authors conclude by discussing promising avenues for future research to improve the reliability and real-world applicability of Concept-based Models.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for predicting time-dependent concrete creep with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting concrete creep inadequately treat time as just an input parameter, failing to model the sequential nature of deformation development.

Method: The method transforms concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task using a transformer architecture with triple-stream attention framework including temporal attention, feature attention, and batch attention.

Result: The model achieves mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999 across all datasets, significantly outperforming traditional models. Ablation studies confirm the importance of attention mechanisms and SHAP analysis identifies key predictive features.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of transformer architectures in materials science, highlighting the possibility for data-driven approaches to transform structural behavior prediction and engineering design.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

*Shaona Ghosh,Amrita Bhattacharjee,Yftah Ziser,Christopher Parisien*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for evolving safety policies is costly. This paper proposes SafeSteer, a method that uses category-specific steering vectors and a gradient-free unsupervised approach to guide LLM outputs towards safer content without requiring contrastive pairwise safe data or causing explicit refusal, while preserving text quality and topic relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting LLMs to changing safety policies through fine-tuning is expensive and impractical. There is a need for more efficient methods to adjust the safety of LLM outputs precisely and customizably during inference time.

Method: The proposed method, SafeSteer, involves: 1) using category-specific steering vectors for precise control; 2) applying a simple, gradient-free unsupervised technique to improve safety steering; and 3) achieving this without needing contrastive pairwise safe data. The method ensures text quality, topic relevance, and avoids explicit refusal.

Result: SafeSteer effectively provides precise control over LLM outputs, prevents blanket refusals, and guides models to generate safe content while maintaining topic relevance. These outcomes are demonstrated across various LLMs, datasets, and risk categories.

Conclusion: SafeSteer offers an effective solution for guiding LLM outputs towards safer content without compromising text quality or relevance. Its simplicity aligns with recent findings favoring straightforward techniques in activation steering.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often

*Nicolas Caron,Christophe Guyeux,Hassan Noura,Benjamin Aynes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of forest fire prediction by proposing a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental contexts in France, providing more actionable and region-specific predictions. It presents the first national-scale AI benchmark for metropolitan France.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forest fire prediction has become increasingly challenging due to climate change intensifying fire behavior and frequency. Traditional binary classification approaches oversimplify the problem, ignoring local conditions and regional differences.

Method: The paper proposes a new approach to model fire risk that is sensitive to local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This is achieved by tailoring fire risk assessment to departmental contexts in France.

Result: The authors present the first national-scale AI benchmark for metropolitan France using advanced AI models on a relatively unexplored dataset, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a summary of important future works that should be considered, along with supplementary materials available on GitHub.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Conclusion: MUC-G4 offers a promising solution for ensuring safety and reliability of compressed neural networks in practical applications.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

*Runxiang Wang,Boxiao Wang,Kai Li,Yifan Zhang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DrSR is a new framework that combines data-driven insight with reflective learning to improve symbolic regression, outperforming classical and LLM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for symbolic regression often over-rely on internal priors and lack explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during equation generation.

Method: DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships within the data to generate structured descriptions while monitoring equation performance and establishing a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations.

Result: Experiments across interdisciplinary datasets demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency.

Conclusion: DrSR has the potential for scientific equation discovery.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低地球轨道卫星提供的地球观测数据对于决策者管理时间敏感事件（如自然灾害）至关重要。然而，卫星数据下传到地面站的带宽有限，导致延迟较大。为了解决这一瓶颈，可以在卫星上处理部分数据并优先下传重要信息。

Method: 研究提出了一种物理感知神经形态网络(PANN)，该网络受物理神经网络的启发，采用忆阻器作为纳米电子电路元件。PANN的权重是动态的，根据忆阻器的状态方程和电路守恒定律更新。通过应用基于距离的度量，PANN生成了物理约束的动力学输出特征以检测自然灾害中的变化。由于动力学输出特征的生成不依赖于训练过程，因此整个模型是无训练的，适合在计算资源有限的情况下实现。

Result: PANN在自然灾难检测任务中表现出色，在每个自然灾害类别中，其结果与最先进的AI模型相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: PANN提供了一种有前景的解决方案，用于解决资源受限的机载处理挑战，特别是在自然灾害检测等需要快速响应的应用中。

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

TL;DR: An abstract about proposing BAT and ALBAT algorithm which leverage backbone data to augment adaptation dataset and enhance adaptation training in personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptation techniques for large backbone models face challenges when there is limited adaptation data. The authors aim to utilize the extensive backbone data from pre-training to improve adaptation training.

Method: The method involves proposing Backbone Augmented Training (BAT) which leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset. They also introduce an advanced data selection scheme and the ALBAT algorithm to implement this approach, based on two formulated mathematical propositions.

Result: BAT and ALBAT efficiently enhance adaptation training in both personalization and language generation tasks, especially when data is scarce.

Conclusion: Leveraging backbone data through BAT and ALBAT can significantly improve adaptation training in scenarios with limited data.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

### [48] [Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers trained on a transitive inference task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289)
*Jesse Geerts,Stephanie Chan,Claudia Clopath,Kimberly Stachenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based models' relational reasoning mechanisms, particularly transitive inference, are explored under two learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL) and in-context learning (ICL). IWL naturally supports transitive inference generalization while ICL does not unless pre-trained on structured tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in transformer-based models across different learning regimes, specifically focusing on transitive inference.

Method: Investigating transitive inference in transformers under two regimes: IWL (storing info in network parameters) and ICL (using input sequence info). Comparing their performance and analyzing mechanistic differences. Examining effects of pre-training on in-context linear regression tasks.

Result: IWL induces a natural bias towards transitive inference generalization. ICL models use match-and-copy strategies for adjacent items but fail to generalize transitively without pre-training. Pre-training on structured tasks allows ICL models to exhibit generalizable transitive inference with human-like characteristics.

Conclusion: Pre-training on tasks with inherent structure aids in developing representations that support in-context relational reasoning in transformers.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the intensifying demand for complex optimization challenges brought by the proliferation of IoT devices. The authors aim to improve upon existing methods that combine Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with reinforcement learning (RL) by offering a more theoretically superior approach.

Method: The method proposed in this paper is the LDPTRLQ algorithm. It involves adapting the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications under a set of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis. This differs from existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, as it effectively balances the greedy optimization of Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate that the LDPTRLQ algorithm outperforms baseline methods using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL. It also surpasses other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability, validating the theoretical derivations.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the LDPTRLQ algorithm offers a theoretically superior way to combine Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with reinforcement learning. Its effectiveness has been validated through simulation results which show its superior performance over baseline methods.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed

learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep-learning framework for accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity in open-pit mining, which blends real-world operational records with synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios. Two architectures are evaluated, and SHAP value analyses identify dominant predictors. Future work will integrate more data to enhance forecast robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in open-pit mining due to significant operational uncertainties introduced by weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and variable crew availability.

Method: A deep-learning framework that uses real-world operational records (high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) and synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. Two architectures are evaluated: an XGBoost regressor and a Long Short-Term Memory network.

Result: XGBoost regressor achieves a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent and Long Short-Term Memory network has a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. SHAP value analyses identify cumulative rainfall, historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features reduces prediction volatility.

Conclusion: This hybrid modelling approach offers a comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management under dynamically uncertain conditions in open-pit mining.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in

an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve both consistency and dependability of next generation ensemble learning systems.

Method: 1. Anatomical process - composing target ensemble model with canonical elements relating to convolutional frustum definition, selected based on diversity. 2. Physiological process - deriving softlog for weak logarithmic operations consistency and intermediate decisions through multiple softlog-softmax layers. 3. Neural information theory process - proposing softlog-based entropy and divergence for constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed intervals. 4. Deriving an informative performance tensor for reliable ensemble evaluation.

Result: Softlog-softmax cascades can improve consistency and dependability in ensemble learning systems. The more complex the problem, the more useful ensemble diversity is.

Conclusion: A 4-step process involving softlog-softmax cascades has been proposed to enhance the consistency and dependability of next-generation ensemble learning systems.

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Examine how design choices like few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning affect accuracy-cost tradeoffs.

Result: Findings indicate that while increased compute improves accuracy, it leads to diminishing returns, higher latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs.

Conclusion: There is a need for a paradigm shift in AI agent design to focus on compute-efficient reasoning that balances performance with real-world deployability constraints.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

*Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma,Wei-Bin Lee,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RedRFT is a new benchmark for RFT-based red teaming methods which combines CleanRL and Tianshou's strengths, offering stable, reproducible implementations with modular components to facilitate experimentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the lack of a unified benchmark for current RFT-based red teaming methods, which affects outcome stability and reproducibility. The authors aim to address this issue by creating RedRFT.

Method: RedRFT is designed as a lightweight benchmark that simplifies and standardizes the implementation and evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. It integrates single-file CleanRL and modularized Tianshou, providing high-quality implementations and modular PPO core components. It also supports various diversity metrics and modularized intrinsic reward computation for experimentation.

Conclusion: This work aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red teaming algorithms and enable rapid prototyping of innovative features for such methods.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

### [56] [You Only Train Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349)
*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a method for optimizing loss weight hyperparameters in one shot through gradient-based optimization. It uses a novel layer with softmax operation and regularization loss to ensure positivity constraints and boundedness of optima. YOTO outperforms grid search on test data for 3D estimation and semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model creation and optimization involves multiple training runs, including different architectural designs, input/output encodings, and losses. The authors aim to reduce the training process to a single run for loss selection and weighting.

Method: YOTO optimizes loss weight hyperparameters via standard gradient-based optimization, treating them as regular network parameters. A novel layer parameterized with softmax ensures positivity constraints while avoiding degenerate gradients. A new regularization loss models uniformity prior among employed losses and ensures boundedness of optima.

Result: YOTO consistently outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data when applied to state-of-the-art networks solving 3D estimation and semantic segmentation problems.

Conclusion: You Only Train Once (YOTO) successfully limits training to one shot for loss selection and weighting by optimizing loss weights in an end-to-end manner, outperforming traditional grid search methods.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

### [57] [Half-Layered Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04352)
*Ethem Alpaydin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的神经网络隐藏层结构，称为'半层'，它结合了随机权重和可训练权重，以减少参数数量并提高泛化性能。实验结果表明，在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上，使用半层的模型可以在较少参数的情况下达到合理的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的全连接层在深度网络中需要大量的参数，这可能导致过拟合和计算成本高。为了解决这个问题，研究者们一直在寻找减少参数数量的方法，同时保持或提高模型的性能。

Method: 提出的“半层”由两部分组成：第一阶段使用固定的随机权重对输入进行加权求和；第二阶段通过两个可训练的权重对总激活值进行缩放和平移，然后通过非线性激活函数。每个隐藏单元只有两个可修改的权重，与输入的数量无关。该方法可以应用于深度网络的第一层或任何后续层，也可以跟在卷积层之后。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上的实验表明，使用半层的模型能够在减少参数数量的同时，达到合理的分类准确率。这种效果归因于随机连接带来的正则化效应。

Conclusion: 半层是一种有效的技术，可以在减少模型参数数量的同时保持较高的分类准确率。这种方法可能适用于其他数据集和任务，并为进一步研究提供了方向。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

TL;DR: A new composite reward function for reinforcement learning in financial trading is proposed, balancing return and risk via four differentiable terms and offering a modular framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to create a more effective reward function for reinforcement learning in financial trading that can balance both return and risk. Unlike single metric objectives such as the Sharpe ratio, this formulation aims to be modular and adaptable to diverse investor preferences through parameterization by weights.

Method: The method involves proposing a novel composite reward function consisting of four differentiable terms: annualized return, downside risk, differential return, and the Treynor ratio. These are combined in a modular way, parameterized by weights (w1, w2, w3, w4). The weights are tuned using grid search to target specific risk-return profiles. Closed-form gradients for each term are derived to facilitate gradient-based training.

Result: Theoretical properties of the reward function, including monotonicity, boundedness, and modularity, are analyzed. This indicates the robustness and adaptability of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: This framework provides a general blueprint for building robust multi-objective reward functions in complex trading environments. It can potentially be extended with additional risk measures or adaptive weighting.

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces, allowing it to be expressed as a wrapper around Euclidean decision tree models, thus enabling optimizations and improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the capabilities of decision trees from Euclidean to hyperbolic spaces by using the Beltrami-Klein model, preserving thresholding operations and leveraging existing optimizations in Euclidean space models.

Method: Reexpress the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model, rewriting it as pre- and post-processing steps around Euclidean tree-based models.

Result: Enables the use of many optimizations from Euclidean space models, leading to improvements in flexibility, speed, and accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach offers a simpler, more maintainable, and extensible codebase for hyperbolic decision trees.

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

Conclusion: Urania successfully provides a novel approach to ensure rigorous differential privacy in LLM chatbot interactions, demonstrating enhanced robustness and effective balance between data utility and privacy.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided

Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful

Conclusion: 样本重播的效果很大程度上取决于所选择的重播样本和任务之间的关系，即使在看似简单的情况下，也可能导致有害的结果。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

*Théo Vincent,Yogesh Tripathi,Tim Faust,Yaniv Oren,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In value-based reinforcement learning, eliminating the target network can lead to instability and performance decline. This paper proposes iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), which uses a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network, sharing remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network. This method leverages iterated Q-learning to reduce the gap between target-free and target-based approaches, improving sample efficiency across various settings while requiring less memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the instability and performance issues that arise when removing the target network in value-based reinforcement learning. The authors aim to step out of the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods by proposing a novel approach that combines elements of both.

Method: The proposed method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), involves using a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network. This enables the leveraging of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel.

Result: The findings demonstrate that iS-QL improves the sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings. It requires a smaller memory footprint and has comparable training time to classical target-based algorithms.

Conclusion: This novel method highlights the potential to scale reinforcement learning research by providing an efficient alternative to classical target-based algorithms.

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents UMCNP, a new hybrid few-shot meta-RL method that combines PPG and task inference-based meta-RL to improve sample efficiency during meta-testing without extra samples in meta-training. It leverages CNPs and reuses previously collected samples for task inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting to unseen test tasks with limited samples during meta-testing when reward signals are absent.

Method: UMCNP uses parameterized policy gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL methods while distinctly separating their roles. During meta-training, it reuses samples collected through PPG meta-RL for offline learning of task inference. In meta-testing, it employs Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) to infer latent representations of transition dynamics from a single test task rollout, allowing self-adaptation via interaction with the learned dynamics model.

Result: UMCNP achieves adaptation to unseen test tasks using significantly fewer samples than baselines in 2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, including cartpole with unknown angle sensor bias and walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Conclusion: UMCNP effectively increases sample efficiency during meta-testing by combining PPG and task inference-based meta-RL, making use of CNPs and reusing samples from meta-training.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

### [64] [Identifying and Understanding Cross-Class Features in Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05032)
*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial training (AT) is a crucial method to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. This paper explores AT through class-wise feature attribution, focusing on cross-class features that are shared by multiple classes and beneficial for robust classification. The study reveals that in the early stages of AT, models tend to learn cross-class features until reaching optimal robustness, after which they shift towards class-specific features leading to robust overfitting. These findings provide new insights into AT mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen the understanding of adversarial training (AT) mechanisms, particularly focusing on how cross-class features affect the learning process during AT.

Method: The authors analyze AT using class-wise feature attribution, identifying the role of cross-class features shared among multiple classes. They conduct systematic studies across various model architectures and settings, providing theoretical evidence via a synthetic data model.

Result: During the initial phase of AT, models predominantly learn cross-class features which enhance robustness. As AT progresses and robust overfitting occurs, models rely more on class-specific features.

Conclusion: This research refines the understanding of AT mechanisms by highlighting the significance of cross-class features and offering a unified view of soft-label training advantages and robust overfitting.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Method: 通过线性回归的框架，分析合成数据在不同条件下的隐私特性，包括生成模型种子受控和随机输入两种情况。

Result: 单个合成数据点可能泄露与发布模型本身一样多的信息，但如果合成数据由随机输入生成，则可以增强隐私保护。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Result: Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, the proposed algorithms demonstrate convergence quality meeting or exceeding that of standard first-order methods while achieving significant memory reduction.

Conclusion: The theoretical and empirical results indicate that zero-order optimization methods can be practical and theoretically grounded approaches for resource-constrained LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

*Zixuan Xia,Aram Davtyan,Paolo Favaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KOALA++ is a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training, achieving accuracy on par or better than state-of-the-art optimizers while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimization algorithms either rely on expensive second-order gradient calculations or do not effectively model structured gradient uncertainty.

Method: KOALA++ directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by recursively updating compact gradient covariance products, improving upon the original KOALA framework by implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions.

Result: Across diverse tasks, including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

Conclusion: KOALA++ provides a more efficient and effective way to model structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training compared to existing first- and second-order optimization methods.

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while

### [69] [Grokking and Generalization Collapse: Insights from \texttt{HTSR} theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04434)
*Hari K. Prakash,Charles H. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies grokking phenomena in neural networks using a 3-layer MLP on MNIST, discovering a novel phase called anti-grokking that occurs late in training when test accuracy collapses while training accuracy remains perfect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the grokking phenomena in neural networks and identify new phases or metrics that can better explain the behavior of neural networks during training.

Method: Training a 3-layer MLP on a subset of MNIST with and without weight decay, analyzing the Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) layer quality metric α, and comparing it with other proposed metrics such as activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and l2 weight norms.

Result: A novel phase named anti-grokking was discovered where test accuracy collapses while training accuracy stays perfect. The HTSR layer quality metric α alone delineates all three phases(pre-grokking, grokking, and anti-grokking), whereas other metrics fail to distinguish grokking from anti-grokking. Anti-grokking is heralded by α < 2 and the appearance of Correlation Traps.

Conclusion: The HTSR α provides a universal layer-convergence target at α ≈ 2 and serves as a valuable measure of generalization. This discovery offers a method to measure overfitting and generalization collapse without direct access to the test data.

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

### [70] [RETRO SYNFLOW: Discrete Flow Matching for Accurate and Diverse Single-Step Retrosynthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04439)
*Robin Yadav,Qi Yan,Guy Wolf,Avishek Joey Bose,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF), a discrete flow-matching framework for single-step retrosynthesis planning in organic chemistry. RSF uses reaction center identification to produce synthons as source distribution and employs Feynman-Kac steering with Sequential Monte Carlo resampling to enhance diversity and feasibility of generated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-step reactant prediction, or single-step retrosynthesis, is challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space. Existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches struggle to produce an accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions.

Method: RSF builds a Markov bridge between the target product molecule and the reactant molecule using a reaction center identification step to produce intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source distribution for the discrete flow. It also employs Feynman-Kac steering with Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.

Result: Empirically, RSF achieves 60.0% top-1 accuracy, outperforming the previous SOTA by 20%. FK-steering improves top-5 round-trip accuracy by 19% over prior template-free SOTA methods while preserving competitive top-k accuracy results.

Conclusion: RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) provides a novel approach to single-step retrosynthesis planning in organic chemistry, demonstrating superior performance in terms of accuracy and diversity of generated samples.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

TL;DR: 通过设计递增的链接函数构建选择性匹配损失函数，以在预测的重要子集区域提高准确性。利用复合Softmax函数开发多维选择性损失框架，克服标准Softmax函数的局限性，在重要评分区域的应用中具有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在某些子集或区域内准确预测比其他区域更重要，但传统损失函数无法区分这些区域的重要性。

Method: 构造选择性匹配损失函数，通过设计递增的链接函数来定义损失敏感度；利用复合Softmax函数开发多维选择性损失框架，解决标准Softmax函数在区分相邻分数时的不足。

Result: 选择性损失函数在重要评分区域的应用中表现出显著优势，包括停留时间预测、检索、排序、知识蒸馏以及大型语言模型微调对齐等问题。

Conclusion: 选择性损失函数能够有效提升模型在高敏感区域的预测性能，并区分不同重要性的区域，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

*Huynh T. T. Tran,Jacob Sander,Achraf Cohen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI framework for NIDS. It incorporates score-based and metamodel-based techniques to improve prediction reliability. Experiments on CIC-IDS-2017 show superior performance over traditional models across six metrics. A transfer learning strategy is also developed, demonstrating effectiveness with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to enhance the robustness, interpretability, and generalization of Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by extending the ODXU framework. This addresses the increasing sophistication of cyber threats and explores the underutilized potential of transfer learning in cybersecurity.

Method: The method involves extending the ODXU framework by incorporating score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy) and metamodel-based techniques (e.g., SHAP values, Information Gain). Additionally, a transfer learning strategy is developed which allows reusing parts of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different dataset, including retraining specific components like the clustering module and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier.

Result: Experiments on the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate. The ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal transfer configuration significantly improves performance even with limited training data. Metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on both datasets.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the extended ODXU framework enhances the capabilities of NIDS through improved feature extraction, symbolic reasoning, and uncertainty quantification. The transfer learning strategy proves effective in adapting pre-trained models to new datasets with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的情况下，选择最优模型和适应策略具有挑战性，通常需要大量实验。因此，研究者希望找到一种方法能够准确预测模型性能和成本，而无需进行昂贵的试验。

Method: 研究者首先将LLMs的策略选择问题形式化，并提出COSMOS这一统一预测框架。该框架包含两个强大的预测器：1）嵌入增强的轻量级代理模型，用于预测微调性能；2）低样本扩展定律，用于预测检索增强的上下文学习效果。通过这些预测器，COSMOS能够在低成本下高效估计适应结果。

Result: 在八个代表性基准上的广泛评估显示，COSMOS实现了高预测精度，同时平均降低了92.72%的计算成本，极端情况下甚至可减少98.71%的成本。这表明该框架能够有效降低LLMs部署的计算开销，同时保持性能标准。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高效预测LLMs适应结果不仅是可行的，而且可以显著减少计算开销，为资源受限环境下的模型选择和部署提供了一种新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the distinction between representational and behavioral systematicity in ML models, analyzes key benchmarks for systematic generalization in language and vision, and suggests methods to assess representational systematicity using mechanistic interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to understand and evaluate systematicity in machine learning models beyond just behavioral systematicity, addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.

Method: The authors analyze existing benchmarks and models for systematic generalization in both language and vision domains, emphasizing the distinction between representational and behavioral systematicity. They also explore assessment methods from the field of mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Key benchmarks in literature primarily focus on behavioral systematicity rather than representational systematicity. The analysis provides insights into how well current benchmarks test systematic generalization across different domains.

Conclusion: To properly address systematicity in ML models, it is crucial to consider representational systematicity alongside behavioral systematicity, utilizing tools from mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

The study highlights the importance of feature selection in improving model efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To classify dental providers into standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers using machine learning models on a dataset with significant missing values.

Method: Used feature ranking methods like information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA to identify important features. Evaluated 12 ML models using 10-fold cross-validation across incremental feature subsets derived from rankings.

Result: Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%), followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest (93.0%). Models improved with more features, SGD and ensemble methods showed robustness to missing data.

Conclusion: Feature selection is crucial for enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, especially in imbalanced healthcare datasets. Integrating feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms can optimize dental provider classification.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为$\perp$Grad的方法，该方法通过在训练过程中正交化梯度，能够在不牺牲模型准确率的前提下改善模型校准。实验表明，在CIFAR-10数据集上使用10%的标注数据时，$\perp$Grad与SGD相比具有更好的校准性能，包括更低的测试损失、减少的softmax过置信和更高的预测熵等。此外，$\perp$Grad在输入数据损坏和长时间训练的情况下表现出更稳定的性能，并且可以与诸如温度缩放等后处理校准技术很好地结合。理论上，研究者证明了简化版$\perp$Grad在温和假设下的收敛性，并分析了其在正齐次网络中的稳定点：$\perp$Grad会收敛到需要通过调整置信度而非改进决策边界来进一步降低损失的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型通常存在校准不足的问题，即模型对自身预测过于自信，这可能导致实际应用中出现不可靠的结果。因此，研究者希望找到一种方法可以在不影响模型准确率的前提下提升模型的校准性能。

Method: 研究者提出了$\perp$Grad方法，该方法通过对训练过程中的梯度进行正交化操作，从而达到改善模型校准的效果。此方法与优化器无关，计算开销极小，并且可以与后处理校准技术（如温度缩放）兼容。

Result: 实验结果表明，在CIFAR-10数据集上使用10%标注数据时，$\perp$Grad与SGD相比不仅保持了相同的准确率，而且在多项校准指标上表现更优，例如更低的测试损失、减少的softmax过置信以及更高的预测熵。同时，$\perp$Grad在面对输入数据损坏（CIFAR-10C）和长时间训练的情况下展现出更平稳的退化特性。理论分析也支持了$\perp$Grad的有效性，证明了其简化版本在一定条件下能够收敛，并描述了其在正齐次网络中的稳定点特性。

Conclusion: $\perp$Grad是一种简单有效的技术，可以在不牺牲模型准确率的情况下显著提升模型校准性能。它适用于各种优化器，计算成本低，并且可以与其他校准技术结合使用，为深度学习模型的可靠性和稳定性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

TL;DR: CryoBoltz combines cryo-EM density maps with pretrained protein structure prediction models to generate accurate 3D structural models of dynamic biomolecular complexes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein structure prediction models struggle to capture conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, while cryo-EM faces challenges in processing raw data into atomic models.

Method: CryoBoltz uses global and local structural constraints from cryo-EM density maps to guide the sampling trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model, producing predictions consistent with experimental data.

Result: This approach successfully builds atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps for various dynamic biomolecular systems like transporters and antibodies.

Conclusion: The integration of cryo-EM data with protein structure prediction models through CryoBoltz provides a powerful method for modeling complex biological systems.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

It shows feasibility in simulated and hardware experiments, achieving performance comparable to standard methods.

updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models increasingly relies on geographically distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware.

Method: Propose HALoS, a hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that introduces local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler effects, and leverages fast intra-region links.

Result: Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially lowering total training time.

Conclusion: Hierarchical, server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed environments.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural MJD, a model combining neural networks with non-stationary Merton jump diffusion for time series prediction. It formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential equation problem and includes mechanisms for tractable learning and improved estimation. Experiments show it outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models struggle with generalizing to non-stationary data and abrupt changes due to their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying stochastic processes.

Method: Neural MJD is introduced, which combines a time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion with a time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process. A likelihood truncation mechanism and an Euler-Maruyama with restart solver are proposed for better learning and estimation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical learning methods.

Conclusion: Neural MJD effectively models non-stationary data and abrupt changes, providing a superior alternative to existing deep learning and statistical learning approaches.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the challenges of federated learning such as training bottlenecks from massive datasets, involvement of a large number of devices, and heterogeneity due to non-IID data distributions.

Method: Introduced mdQFL (model-driven quantum federated learning) which is adaptable to different numbers of devices and explores training and update personalization along with test generalization within a QFL setting.

Result: mdQFL achieved nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs while maintaining or improving model accuracy and enhancing local model training.

Conclusion: mdQFL offers an efficient solution for quantum federated learning, reducing communication costs and improving performance under diverse non-IID data conditions.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled

rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

*Kareem Amin,Salman Avestimehr,Sara Babakniya,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Natalia Ponomareva,Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Differentially private (DP) language model inference generates private synthetic text by using a sensitive input example to prompt an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM). Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly at random, which degrades the quality of privately generated text. This paper remedies this problem by clustering the input data before selecting inference batches and introduces a new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing medians instead of averages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the quality of differentially private synthetic text generation, especially when sensitive examples concern heterogeneous topics.

Method: Clustering input data before selecting inference batches and introducing a new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing medians instead of averages.

Result: Improvements in terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task performance. Produces high-quality synthetic data at significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: This approach leverages the fact that the median has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar, allowing a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the privacy properties of this algorithm.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of scaling laws for comparing models and datasets in transfer learning, focusing on CLIP and MaMMUT. It derives full scaling laws through dense measurements, revealing MaMMUT's better scalability and sample efficiency compared to CLIP. The study validates these findings across various downstream tasks and datasets, while also demonstrating the feasibility of using a constant learning rate schedule to reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a systematic method for comparing and improving foundation models and datasets by utilizing scaling laws derived from dense measurements.

Method: Derive full scaling laws for CLIP and MaMMUT models based on dense measurements across different scales of models and samples. Compare the two models in terms of their improvement with scale and sample efficiency. Validate the comparison across various downstream tasks (classification, retrieval, segmentation) and datasets (DataComp, DFN, Re-LAION). Demonstrate that scaling laws can be derived with a constant learning rate schedule to reduce compute cost.

Result: MaMMUT shows stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard CLIP. These trends are consistently observed across different downstream tasks and datasets. A constant learning rate schedule can be used to derive accurate scaling laws, reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: Accurate derivation of scaling laws enables model and dataset comparison across scales, avoiding misleading conclusions based on single reference scales. This paves the way for systematic improvements of open foundation models and datasets.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Energy-based models (EBMs) are hard to train, but linking them to generative adversarial networks through a minimax game can help. This paper proposes using bidirectional bounds instead of just lower bounds to stabilize EBM training and improve density estimation and sample generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBMs estimate unnormalized densities elegantly, but they are difficult to train. The instability caused by minimizing a lower bound in the minimax game needs to be addressed.

Method: The method involves working with bidirectional bounds when training EBMs - maximizing a lower bound and minimizing an upper bound. Four different bounds on the log-likelihood are investigated, derived from different perspectives including singular values of the generator Jacobian, mutual information, gradient penalty-like bound, and one based on diffusion processes.

Result: The use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation. The pros and cons of the different approaches were compared.

Conclusion: Bidirectional bounds provide a stable approach for training EBMs leading to better density estimation and sample generation.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

*Guruprerana Shabadi,Rajeev Alur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient algorithm for worst-case risk minimization in agentic systems by traversing an agent graph and approximating value-at-risk, demonstrating its effectiveness in control benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern agentic systems need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize task success but also minimize risk, including safety, fairness, and privacy. This requires analyzing low-probability behaviors of agent compositions.

Method: Formalize an agentic workflow as a directed acyclic graph (agent graph), define worst-case risk as the tail quantile of the loss distribution, and introduce an efficient algorithm using a union bound and dynamic programming to find near-optimal agent compositions.

Result: Prove that the approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for practical loss functions and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in approximating value-at-risk and identifying optimal agent compositions in video game-like control benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully navigates agent graphs to find near-optimal agent compositions while minimizing worst-case risk.

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Conclusion: Neural network reprogrammability is positioned as a fundamental paradigm for efficient model adaptation, with promising research directions identified.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

### [94] [The Oversmoothing Fallacy: A Misguided Narrative in GNN Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04653)
*MoonJeong Park,Sunghyun Choi,Jaeseung Heo,Eunhyeok Park,Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This position paper challenges the overstated influence of oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), attributes it to vanishing gradient rather than aggregation, and demonstrates that classical solutions enable successful stacking of deep GNN layers without performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reassess the role of oversmoothing in limiting the performance of deep GNNs and advocate for further exploration of deep GNN architectures.

Method: By analyzing the three core operations of GNNs (aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation), the paper shows that oversmoothing has been mistakenly associated with the vanishing gradient problem, which is caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. It also explores how classical solutions like skip connections and normalization can help in building deep GNNs.

Result: The results indicate that oversmoothing is not unique to GNNs and classical solutions enable the stacking of deep GNN layers without performance degradation.

Conclusion: The misconceptions about oversmoothing are clarified, and new insights into the potential of deep GNNs are provided.

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

### [95] [Noise-Resistant Label Reconstruction Feature Selection for Partial Multi-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04669)
*Wanfu Gao,Hanlin Pan,Qingqi Han,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the 'Curse of dimensionality' in Partial Multi-label Learning (PML) by proposing a new method that considers label relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity, which helps to identify positive labels more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of model overfitting and declining classification performance due to high-dimensional data in PML, where each sample is associated with multiple candidate labels and at least one is correct.

Method: A PML feature selection method utilizing two important characteristics: label relationship's noise-resistance for disambiguating labels, and label connectivity for finding representative labels. The learning process is designed through a reformed low-rank assumption and the weight matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenges posed by high-dimensional data in PML and improves the identification of positive labels.

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

### [96] [FedAPM: Federated Learning via ADMM with Partial Model Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04672)
*Shengkun Zhu,Feiteng Nie,Jinshan Zeng,Sheng Wang,Yuan Sun,Yuan Yao,Shangfeng Chen,Quanqing Xu,Chuanhui Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In federated learning, datasets from different devices often violate the i.i.d. assumption and using a single model across clients with various data modalities is impractical. Partial model personalization can exacerbate client drift, reducing FL algorithm effectiveness and efficiency. To address this, we propose FedAPM, an FL framework based on ADMM that mitigates client drift by constructing an augmented Lagrangian function with first-order and second-order proximal terms. FedAPM demonstrates superior stability, efficiency, and convergence compared to other FL frameworks, achieving significant performance improvements in test accuracy, F1 score, and AUC while requiring fewer communication rounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the issues arising from the violation of the i.i.d. assumption in federated learning and the impracticality of using a single model across clients with various data modalities. Specifically, the authors aim to mitigate the problem of client drift caused by partial model personalization, which can reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms.

Method: The proposed method is FedAPM, an FL framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This framework constructs the augmented Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal terms into the objective. The second-order term provides fixed correction, while the first-order term offers compensatory correction between the local and shared models. Explicit estimates of the Lagrange multiplier are used to enhance stability and efficiency.

Result: FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence compared to other methods. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer communication rounds. Experiments were conducted using four heterogeneous and multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate these performance improvements.

Conclusion: FedAPM is a stable and efficient FL framework that effectively mitigates client drift. It demonstrates global convergence from arbitrary initial points to a stationary point under mild assumptions, achieving constant, linear, and sublinear rates. The framework significantly enhances the performance of federated learning in terms of test accuracy, F1 score, and AUC, making it a promising approach for addressing the challenges posed by non-i.i.d. data and various data modalities in FL.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

TL;DR: 在时间序列预测的集成学习背景下，本文探讨了预测精度和计算成本之间的权衡。研究发现，集成方法能显著提高预测性能，但伴随巨大的计算成本。降低重训练频率可大幅减少成本且对精度影响较小，小规模集成（2-3个模型）通常就能达到接近最优的结果。这些结论为部署可扩展和成本效益高的预测系统提供了实际指导。

Motivation: 随着数据集规模和预测模型复杂性的持续增长，预测精度与计算成本之间的权衡变得尤为重要，特别是在时间序列预测的集成学习中。

Method: 评估了十个基础模型和八种集成配置在两个大规模零售数据集(M5和VN1)上的表现，考虑了不同重训练频率下的点预测和概率预测准确性。

Result: 集成方法能持续提升预测性能，特别是概率预测方面；降低重训练频率可显著降低成本，对点预测精度影响较小；效率驱动的小规模集成(2-3个模型)能实现接近最优的准确率并显著降低成本。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计集成方法和选择适当的重训练策略，可以得到精确、稳健且成本效益高的预测结果，适用于实际应用，并支持可持续AI的发展目标。

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

### [98] [Towards Better Generalization via Distributional Input Projection Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04690)
*Yifan Hao,Yanxin Lu,Xinwei Shen,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In the era of overparameterized models, simply relying on training loss is insufficient to evaluate generalization performance. This paper introduces DIPNet (Distributional Input Projection Networks), a framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer, thereby inducing a smoother loss landscape and promoting better generalization. Theoretical analysis shows that DIPNet reduces local smoothness measures and the network's Lipschitz constant. Empirical validation across various architectures (ViTs, LLMs, ResNet, MLPs) demonstrates consistent enhancement in test performance under standard settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With overparameterized models becoming more common, training loss alone does not provide sufficient insight into generalization performance. Smoothness has been associated with improved generalization, but directly enforcing it in neural networks poses challenges.

Method: The paper proposes Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), which project inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to the input, leading to better generalization.

Result: Empirically, DIPNet consistently enhances test performance across different architectures and tasks, including under standard settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DIPNet provides a general and effective approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning models by seamlessly integrating the proposed input projection strategy.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a proximal Bregman response function for GNNs to predict the influence of edge deletions and insertions without retraining, improving interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the interpretability and robustness of graph neural networks by understanding how individual edges affect their behavior.

Method: Propose a proximal Bregman response function tailored for GNNs which relaxes convexity requirements, accounts for message propagation effects, and extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show accurate influence predictions for various GNN characteristics and demonstrate versatility in applications like graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed method accurately predicts edge influences in GNNs, contributing to their interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) optimizes reasoning pattern selection, showing preference for high-success-rate patterns while maintaining stability. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal two convergence regimes based on initial model strength and suggest supervised fine-tuning can mitigate slower optimization in weaker models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how Reinforcement Learning (RL) improves reasoning abilities in models, particularly focusing on the mechanism of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).

Method: Conduct extensive experiments and theoretical analyses on RLVR to explore its effects on reasoning pattern selection, gradient flow, and training dynamics. Investigate convergence regimes and the impact of supervised fine-tuning on weaker models.

Result: RLVR-trained models prefer high-success-rate reasoning patterns, maintain stable performance on individual patterns, and exhibit distinct convergence behaviors depending on initial model strength. Supervised fine-tuning before RLVR can improve optimization for weaker models.

Conclusion: This study enhances the theoretical understanding of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and provides insights into improving reasoning capabilities through optimized RLVR approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a satellite data-driven machine learning framework to classify drought severity in 38 districts of Bangladesh, using unsupervised and classification algorithms with weather data from 2012-2024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drought indices often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature. Current machine learning models for drought prediction have been underexplored in Bangladesh, lacking comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple districts.

Method: A machine learning framework that uses unsupervised algorithms (K-means, Bayesian Gaussian Mixture) for clustering and classification models (KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes) for classifying drought severity levels across 38 districts of Bangladesh.

Result: Successfully classified drought severity into different levels but found significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions.

Conclusion: Machine learning models show great potential in identifying and predicting drought conditions in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

*José Manuel de Frutos,Manuel A. Vázquez,Pablo M. Olmos,Joaquín Míguez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces dual-ISL, a novel objective for training implicit generative models that swaps the roles of target and model distributions in ISL framework. It proves properties of resulting rank-based discrepancy and provides theoretical analysis including error bounds and convergence rates. Empirically, dual-ISL shows advantages in convergence speed, stability, and mode collapse prevention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current rank-based statistical metrics like ISL are effective tools for training implicit generative models. However, there is a need to explore new objectives with better properties for optimization and performance.

Method: Introduced dual-ISL by interchanging roles of target and model distributions in ISL framework. Proved properties of the resulting rank-based discrepancy dK. Developed theoretical framework interpreting dK as L2-projection onto Bernstein polynomial basis. Derived exact bounds on truncation error, precise convergence rates, and closed-form expression for truncated density approximation. Extended analysis to multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections.

Result: Dual-ISL converges more rapidly, delivers smoother and more stable training, and more effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods. It also provides an explicit density approximation.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL offers significant practical advantages over existing methods for training implicit generative models due to its theoretical properties and empirical performance.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

TL;DR: 研究人员提出了一种基于损失梯度正交化的快速遗忘算法，该算法能够在维护生成模型原始保真度的同时，有效去除特定数据的影响，并在MNIST和CelebA数据集上验证了其比前人方法快数个数量级的遗忘时间。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型变得越来越强大和普及，由于隐私问题、法律要求或纠正有害内容等原因，对特定数据进行遗忘的能力变得越来越重要。然而，传统的训练方式中知识是不断积累和强化的，因此需要一种能够选择性地去除特定数据点影响且无需从头开始重新训练的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于损失梯度正交化的快速遗忘算法可以有效地使特定数据被遗忘，同时保持生成模型的质量和所需训练数据的影响，极大地提高了遗忘效率。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGRPO is proposed to improve GRPO by adding a second layer that corrects errors in the initial response, enhancing reasoning and self-correction abilities in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind MGRPO is to address the inefficiency of exploration dynamics in GRPO due to lack of intermediate supervision, which can lead to reward vanishing and unstable training.

Method: MGRPO uses a two-layer approach: the first layer generates an initial response with standard GRPO, and the second layer specifically identifies and corrects errors in this response, creating a self-correction loop.

Result: MGRPO outperforms standard GRPO on several mathematical reasoning benchmarks, showing improvements in both reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Conclusion: MGRPO provides a mechanism for implicit process-level supervision through rewarding successful error correction, improving the performance of large language models without needing a densely-annotated reward model.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces log-linear attention, a new attention mechanism that combines the efficiency of linear attention with the expressiveness of softmax attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of quadratic-compute and linear-memory complexity in traditional attention mechanisms while overcoming the fixed-size hidden state limitation in RNN-based models like linear attention and state-space models.

Method: Developed log-linear attention which replaces the fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. This method allows for a matmul-rich parallel form with a compute cost that is log-linear in sequence length.

Result: Log-linear attention can be applied on top of existing linear attention variants and has been instantiated in two recent architectures (Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet), showing good performance compared to their linear-time variants.

Conclusion: Log-linear attention offers a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, providing a promising direction for future research in scalable sequence modeling.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive benchmark and library for Graph Transformers (GTs) to promote deeper understanding and further development.

Method: Introduced OpenGT, a comprehensive benchmark for GTs that establishes standardized experimental settings and incorporates a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs for evaluation from multiple perspectives.

Result: Uncovered several critical insights about GTs including model transfer difficulty, local attention limitations, efficiency trade-offs, application scenarios of positional encodings, and preprocessing overhead.

Conclusion: Established a foundation for future graph transformer research with emphasis on fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability, and developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

*Artin Tajdini,Jonathan Scarlett,Kevin Jamieson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了具有重尾奖励的随机线性bandits问题，提出了一种新的基于消除的算法，改进了上下界，并对有限动作集和无限维设置进行了分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望解决在重尾奖励下的随机线性bandits问题，其中奖励具有有限的$(1+\epsilon)$-绝对中心矩。目标是改进现有算法在最小最大后悔（minimax regret）上的上下界。

Method: 提出了一种由实验设计指导的新消除算法，该算法实现了$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$的后悔。此外，还建立了$\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$的下界。对于有限动作集，推导了类似的改进上下界，并且对于某些几何形状（如$l_p$-norm球体），进一步减少了对维度$d$的依赖。最后，通过核技巧处理了无限维设置，特别是为Mat\'ern核建立了首个次线性后悔界。

Result: 新算法改进了对于所有$\epsilon \in (0, 1)$时对维度$d$的依赖，并在$\epsilon = 1$时恢复了已知的最佳结果。同时，提出的下界严格优于多臂bandits的情况，突显了重尾线性bandits问题的难度。对于有限动作集和特定几何形状，获得了更优的后悔界。并且首次为Mat\'ern核在所有$\epsilon \in (0, 1]$情况下建立了次线性后悔界。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出一种新的消除算法，显著改进了重尾奖励下随机线性bandits问题的上下界。研究成果不仅适用于有限动作集，还拓展到了无限维设置，为解决此类问题提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

*Thore Gerlach,Sascha Mücke,Christian Bauckhage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the connection between k-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in vector quantization via Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), revealing KDE-QUBO as a special case of k-medoids-QUBO under certain assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the relationship between two prominent vector quantization methods, k-medoids clustering and KDE, which appear unrelated but may share underlying connections.

Method: Compare a heuristic QUBO formulation for k-medoids with a principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based VQ.

Result: Demonstrates that KDE-QUBO is a special case of k-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map.

Conclusion: Reveals a deeper structural relationship between k-medoids and KDE approaches in vector quantization, providing new insights into the geometric interpretation of weighting parameters in QUBO formulations.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

TL;DR: 在使用Adam优化器训练不同架构和规模的神经网络时，损失峰值普遍出现。本文研究了导致Adam峰值的根本机制，发现其自适应预调节器本身可以触发峰值，并通过实验验证了这一机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究Adam优化器在训练过程中导致损失峰值的根本原因，挑战以往将此现象归因于损失景观更尖锐特性的解释。

Method: 识别出一个关键区域，在该区域中，梯度平方远小于二阶矩估计值，导致后者经历β2-指数衰减并对当前梯度信息反应迟缓。分析这种机制如何使预调节Hessian的最大特征值超过经典稳定性阈值，从而引发不稳定性，并进一步导致梯度与最大特征方向对齐，最终产生损失峰值。

Result: 通过广泛的实验（包括全连接网络、卷积网络和Transformer架构），验证了所提出的机制能够准确描述Adam峰值的产生过程。

Conclusion: Adam优化器的自适应预调节器本身可以触发损失峰值，这种现象与梯度平方和二阶矩估计之间的关系以及由此引发的不稳定性密切相关。

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 通过强化学习在逻辑谜题上微调大语言模型，可提升其结构化推理能力及泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在许多监督任务中表现出色，但在不熟悉的环境中的结构化推理能力却常常不足，这表明标准的微调流程可能灌输了狭窄的领域特定启发式方法，而非通用的思考策略。

Method: 提出了一种“玩中学”框架，通过强化学习在七个定制逻辑谜题上微调大语言模型，这些谜题旨在培养不同的推理技能，如约束传播、空间一致性和符号演绎。使用带有可验证奖励的强化学习设置，模型根据谜题正确性获得二元反馈，鼓励迭代、假设驱动的问题解决。

Result: 此训练方法显著提高了在一系列数学基准测试中的分布外性能，特别是对于需要多步推理的中等难度问题。跨问题类别和难度水平的分析显示，谜题训练促进了可转移的推理程序，增强了代数操作、几何推理和组合逻辑能力，而在死记硬背或高度专业化的任务上收益有限。

Conclusion: 强化学习在逻辑谜题上的应用重塑了大语言模型的内部推理机制，使其能够更稳健和组合地泛化，而不依赖于特定任务的符号工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

TL;DR: The paper presents EHR2Path, a model that transforms diverse EHR data into structured representations for predicting patient health trajectories and generating topic-specific summary tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for managing patient data are limited in scope and do not adequately capture complex, longitudinal interactions needed for personalized care.

Method: EHR data is transformed into structured representations and used to design EHR2Path, a holistic pathway prediction model. A novel summary mechanism embeds long-term temporal context into topic-specific summary tokens.

Result: EHR2Path outperforms competitive baselines in next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation tasks, enabling detailed simulations of patient trajectories.

Conclusion: EHR2Path opens a path towards predictive and personalized healthcare by effectively forecasting various patient outcomes such as vital signs, lab test results, or length-of-stay.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

### [112] [Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859)
*Yin Lu,Tong He,Xuening Zhu,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies weaknesses in traditional sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), proposing a hybrid model that overcomes these limitations. This model theoretically recovers structured data across manifolds and empirically produces sparser latent representations with comparable reconstruction error on synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming SAEs, VAEs, and diffusion models in certain domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that despite their wide applicability, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have seen few changes since their inception, primarily consisting of deep encoder/decoder layers with deterministic sparse regularizers. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer an exception but are not fully explored for sparse representation tasks. The authors aim to address underappreciated weaknesses in both SAEs and VAEs.

Method: The authors formalize weaknesses in SAEs and VAEs and propose a hybrid alternative model. This model is designed to recover structured data spread across a union of manifolds. It aims to produce sparser latent representations without increasing reconstruction error.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed model accurately estimates underlying manifold dimensions and produces sparser latent representations while maintaining reconstruction quality. It outperforms equivalent-capacity SAEs, VAEs, and even recent diffusion models in domains like images and language model activation patterns.

Conclusion: The hybrid model offers a significant improvement over traditional SAEs and VAEs by addressing their theoretical weaknesses and providing superior empirical performance. It represents a step forward in modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Sameer Khurana,Ricard Marxer,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why contrastive losses are ineffective for learning aligned representation spaces due to modality-specific information, offering theoretical insights and proposing a regularization term for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive losses have been found ineffective in aligning representation spaces despite their widespread use in multimodal representation learning. This issue is attributed to the presence of modality-specific information that current methods do not address.

Method: The authors theoretically analyze this problem using the Information Bottleneck Principle, empirically study the impact of hyperparameters on this phenomenon, and propose a regularization term derived via variational approximation to enhance representational alignment.

Result: Through controlled experiments and real-world applications, the proposed regularization term demonstrates advantages in improving the alignment of multimodal representations.

Conclusion: Modality-specific information significantly affects the effectiveness of contrastive losses in multimodal representation learning. The proposed regularization term offers a promising solution to improve alignment.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

### [114] [There Was Never a Bottleneck in Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04877)
*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: To address the interpretability issue of deep learning representations, this paper proposes Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) that incorporate an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning representations are difficult to interpret and may hinder deployment in sensitive applications. Although CBMs have been proposed as a solution, they do not impose a true bottleneck since a component predicting a concept may encode more information than just about that concept.

Method: The authors propose MCBMs which use an IB objective with a variational regularization term added to the training loss to ensure each representation component retains only information relevant to its corresponding concept.

Result: MCBMs support concept-level interventions with theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer greater flexibility in key design choices.

Conclusion: MCBMs provide a more interpretable and theoretically grounded approach to deep learning representations.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

TL;DR: The paper presents a semi-automated classification pipeline for hip dysplasia using CT scans and introduces the GPDSSM model, which improves classification accuracy and saves clinician's time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for early diagnosis of hip dysplasia to reduce the risk of osteoarthritis.

Method: A pipeline combining Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism was developed to create the GPDSSM. It uses volumetric CT scans and clinically annotated landmarks for statistical shape modeling.

Result: GPDSSM effectively distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls with an AUC of 96.2%, outperforming angle-based methods (AUC 91.2%). It also reduces the need for manual measurements by clinicians.

Conclusion: The GPDSSM offers a more accurate and efficient approach to classify hip dysplasia, potentially aiding in earlier surgical interventions.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Motivation: To understand the open questions and counterintuitive behaviors in training long-context reasoning models via reinforcement learning.

Method: Systematically analyzing the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, identifying data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization and exploring strategies to enhance reasoning efficiency, investigating unstable performance across various reasoning models and benchmarks.

Result: Positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, while negative samples significantly enhance generalization and robustness; two strategies are proposed to better leverage data in group relative policy optimization; multiple evaluation runs mitigate unstable performance issue.

Conclusion: Training solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. Two strategies improve reasoning efficiency. Multiple evaluation runs help stabilize performance.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: To address the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0 and align automation systems with the human-centric principles of Industry 5.0, the authors aim to simplify human-machine interaction through the integration of Agentic AI and intent-based paradigm.

Method: The method involves developing a conceptual framework that combines Agentic AI systems with intent-based processing. Human operators express high-level goals in natural language, which are then decomposed into expectations, conditions, targets, context, and information. These intents guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools to execute domain-specific tasks.

Result: The proof of concept implementation using the CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK) demonstrated the feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework shows potential in reducing technical barriers and enabling scalable, intent-driven automation in alignment with Industry 5.0 principles. Despite challenges related to data quality and explainability, the approach offers new possibilities for industrial automation.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction

and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时需要大量的计算资源和能量，而简单的量化可能会显著降低性能。因此，需要一种更高效且不会大幅影响性能的量化方法。

Method: FPTQuant引入了四种轻量级、表达性强的函数保持变换（FPTs），分别是可合并的预RoPE变换、用于值的可合并变换、MLP块内的可合并缩放变换以及廉价的动态缩放变换。这些变换利用了标准Transformer操作中的等变性和独立性，以维持模型功能并使中间激活分布更适合量化。此外，FPTs通过局部训练减少异常值，并进行端到端训练以匹配量化和全精度模型的输出。

which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

*Ashkan Soleymani,Georgios Piliouras,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 引入了Cautious Optimism框架，通过控制FTRL的学习节奏，在保持解耦性的同时，实现更快速的正则化学习，并在多样自我博弈中达到接近最优的遗憾界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究提出了自适应控制学习节奏的OMWU变体，这启发了对无遗憾学习加速现象的研究。

Method: 提出Cautious Optimism框架，将任意Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)实例作为输入，输出一个加速的无遗憾学习算法，通过最小计算开销调整FTRL的学习节奏。

Result: 实现了在多样自我博弈中接近最优的$O_T(\log T)$遗憾界限，同时在对抗场景下保留了最优的$O(\sqrt{T})$遗憾界限。

Conclusion: 无需依赖单调步长，展示了在一般博弈中快速学习的新途径。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

### [121] [Towards Reasonable Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05014)
*Nektarios Kalampalikis,Kavya Gupta,Georgi Vitanov,Isabel Valera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces CREAM, a new Concept Bottleneck Models that encodes concept-concept and concept-task relationships, uses a regularized side-channel for competitive task performance while maintaining high concept importance. Experiments show it mainly relies on concepts to match black-box model performances and mitigates concept leakage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model that explicitly encodes concept-concept and concept-task relationships to enforce desired reasoning, while achieving competitive task performance and keeping high concept importance.

Method: CREAM embeds directed or bidirected concept-concept relationships and concept to task relationships specified by human expert, severs undesired information flows, and integrates a regularized black-box side-channel used only when necessary to enhance performance.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CREAM mainly depends on concepts to achieve task performance comparable with black-box models and the embedded relationships facilitate model interventions and reduce concept leakage.

Conclusion: CREAM is effective in leveraging concepts for task performance, reducing concept leakage, and facilitating model interventions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

### [122] [Multi-Point Proximity Encoding For Vector-Mode Geospatial Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05016)
*John Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Vector-mode geospatial data needs to be encoded for use in machine learning models. This paper introduces MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding, which represents shapes as vectors capturing essential geometric properties based on scaled distances from reference points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to encode vector-mode geospatial data (points, lines, and polygons) into a form that can be used with traditional machine learning and artificial intelligence models.

Method: The method, called MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding, encodes shapes by calculating scaled distances from the shape to a set of reference points within a region of interest. This approach allows any type of shape to be parameterized for machine learning models.

Result: MPP encoding demonstrates shape-centricity and continuity, differentiates spatial objects based on their geometric features, and captures pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. It performs better than an alternative rasterization-based method.

Conclusion: MPP encoding provides an effective way to represent vector-mode geospatial data for use in machine learning models, outperforming rasterization-based methods.

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

*Kuang He,Wei Tang,Tong Wei,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates foundation models in partial label learning (PLL) and proposes PartialCLIP, revealing the impact of model selection and adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training classifiers with inexact supervision in PLL by leveraging foundation models for transferrable representations.

Method: Empirically evaluate 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8 benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios and propose PartialCLIP framework.

Result: Foundation models significantly improve PLL performance, exhibit similar performance across approaches, maintain stability with varying ambiguity levels, but are sensitive to model selection and adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: Current PLL approaches have limitations and the findings provide insights for developing more generalizable PLL models.

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

### [124] [TIMING: Temporality-Aware Integrated Gradients for Time Series Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05035)
*Hyeongwon Jang,Changhun Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In the field of time series explainable AI (XAI), current methods mainly focus on point-wise attribution magnitudes and ignore directional impacts, resulting in suboptimal identification of significant points. Although conventional Integrated Gradients (IG) can capture critical points with both positive and negative effects, current evaluation metrics cannot properly assess this ability. Therefore, we propose two new evaluation metrics: Cumulative Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP). Under these metrics, IG performs better than recent counterparts. However, directly applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal results because it ignores temporal relationships. To solve this problem, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties. Experiments show that TIMING outperforms existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods for time series focus on point-wise attribution magnitudes and overlook directional impacts, leading to suboptimal identification of significant points. Also, current evaluation metrics fail to properly assess the ability to identify significant positive and negative points.

Method: Propose two novel evaluation metrics: CPD and CPP. Introduce TIMING, a method that enhances IG by incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.

Result: Under the proposed metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines in extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks.

Conclusion: TIMING is an effective method for time series XAI that overcomes the limitations of directly applying IG to time series data.

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our

*Nicolas Lell,Ansgar Scherp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces inductive node2vec (iN2V), an approach to adapt the traditional transductive node2vec for inductive settings, allowing computation of embeddings for unseen nodes. iN2V improves node classification accuracy and can be combined with other embedding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional node embedding methods like node2vec are limited to transductive settings, requiring all nodes (including test nodes) to be available during training. This limits their applicability on new or unseen nodes.

Method: The authors propose iN2V, which involves a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for unseen nodes and modifications to the original N2V training process to prepare for this procedure.

Result: iN2V improves node classification accuracy by 1 point on average, with up to 6 points improvement depending on the dataset and number of unseen nodes.

Conclusion: iN2V is a plug-in approach that can create new or enrich existing embeddings and can be combined with other embedding methods, making it versatile for inductive node representation learning.

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预测模型分歧的实用且高效的监控算法D3M，用于解决部署后退化（PDD）监控问题。该算法在非退化转移下具有低假阳性率，并在退化转移下提供样本复杂性边界以实现高真阳性率。实验结果表明其在标准基准和真实医学数据集上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型在动态环境中的性能会因数据分布的变化而退化，但在无标签情况下判断何时重新训练模型是一个开放的挑战。本文旨在解决这一问题，即如何监测模型部署后的性能退化（PDD）。

Method: 提出了名为D3M的监控算法，该方法基于预测模型之间的分歧来检测模型性能退化。通过分析模型预测分歧，D3M能够在无需访问标签的情况下有效识别性能退化的时机。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界大规模内部医学数据集上的实证结果表明，D3M在非退化转移下具有较低的假阳性率，在退化转移下能够实现较高的真阳性率，从而证明了其作为高性能机器学习流水线警报机制的可行性。

Conclusion: D3M是一种有效的PDD监控方法，适用于动态环境中模型性能的监测，可为高风险机器学习系统提供可靠的重新训练时机提示。

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

*Shijian Xu,Marcello Massimo Negri,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks are hard to interpret, linear models are less powerful but interpretable. This paper introduces NIMO, a model that leverages neural networks to improve linear model predictions while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks have been successful but difficult to interpret, whereas linear models are interpretable but less expressive. The authors seek to combine the strengths of both types of models.

Method: The NIMO model is designed with a neural network component that learns nonlinear corrections to linear model predictions. The optimization algorithm uses profile likelihood to adjust neural network parameters and analytically update linear coefficients. Adaptive ridge regression incorporates sparsity constraints.

Result: Empirically, the model can recover underlying linear coefficients and significantly enhance predictive accuracy compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches. It achieves better performance in various regression and classification tasks.

Conclusion: NIMO successfully combines the benefits of neural networks and linear models by improving prediction accuracy while preserving the interpretability of linear coefficients.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

*Marten Lienen,Abdullah Saydemir,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends the HiPPO theory by incorporating measurement noise, deriving an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics which improves the model's resistance to noise during both training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitation of the HiPPO framework, which assumes data to be noise-free, an assumption that is often violated in real-world scenarios. By extending HiPPO theory to include measurement noise, the authors aim to create a more robust initialization method for state space models.

Method: The authors reinterpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where data enters as a noise-free control signal. They reformulate this problem so that the data becomes noisy outputs of a latent system. From this reformulation, they derive an alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of the latent system from the data without increasing runtime.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the new initialization method enhances the resistance of state-space models to noise at both training and inference stages.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with the presentation of an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics that effectively handles measurement noise, thus improving model performance in noisy conditions.

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a complex framework for posterior distributions. This paper proposes a kernelized KL divergence estimator with nonparametric smoothing and importance sampling correction to stabilize training and reduce bias in high dimensions, showing theoretical connections to Stein variational gradient descent and demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art SIVI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training semi-implicit variational inference with KL divergence is challenging due to high variance and bias in high-dimensional settings. Current methods work but are moderately expensive.

Method: Propose a kernelized KL divergence estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing and introduce an importance sampling correction to further reduce the bias. Establish theoretical connection to the amortized version of Stein variational gradient descent.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms or matches state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers more stable and efficient optimization for semi-implicit variational inference.

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

systems running MicroPython. The system has been experimentally evaluated,
achieving over 96% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal readings and
above 78% precision in detecting anomalies across all tested configurations,
while maintaining a memory usage below 160 KB during model training. These
results highlight its suitability for resource-constrained environments and
edge systems, while upholding federated learning principles of data privacy and
collaborative learning.

Conclusion: 生成扩散模型与联想记忆模型之间存在紧密联系，Morse-Smale动力系统为理解这些模型提供了理论框架，特别是在低噪声条件下的稳定性分析方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

TL;DR: TreeRPO是一种新的方法，通过树采样估计推理步骤中的奖励期望，提供更精细和密集的奖励信号，从而显著提高LLM性能。实验表明，该算法将Qwen-2.5-Math在测试基准上的平均Pass@1准确率从19.0%提升到35.5%，并且相比GRPO性能提高了2.9%，响应长度减少了18.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法中，基于完整轨迹定义的奖励对优化推理过程的中间步骤指导不足，需要一种能提供更精细奖励信号的方法来改进这一问题。

Method: TreeRPO通过树采样直接估计推理步骤中的数学期望奖励，而不依赖单独的步骤奖励模型；利用树采样过程中生成的步级组计算奖励，基于群相对奖励训练机制（GRPO）进行创新性改进，生成细粒度和密集的奖励信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，TreeRPO显著提升了Qwen-2.5-Math的平均Pass@1准确率，从19.0%提升至35.5%；与GRPO相比，性能高出2.9%，同时平均响应长度减少18.1%。

Conclusion: TreeRPO通过提供更精细和密集的奖励信号，有效提升了LLM的推理能力和效率，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness

Motivation: 扩散重排序方法虽然能有效建模数据流形，但正信号会随着远离源点而减弱，降低了局部区域之外的辨别能力。

Method: 提出了一种Locality Preserving Markovian Transition（LPMT）框架，包括三个步骤：1) 使用Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion（BCD）整合独立图上的扩散过程以建立强相似关系；2) 利用Locality State Embedding（LSE）将每个实例编码为分布以增强局部一致性；3) 通过Thermodynamic Markovian Transition（TMT）过程连接这些分布，实现高效全局检索同时保持局部有效性。

Conclusion: LPMT框架能够准确测量流形距离，提高实例检索的效果，同时兼顾全局和局部性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

*Gen Li,Yuchen Jiao,Yu Huang,Yuting Wei,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现代大型语言模型能够进行上下文内学习。本文发展了一种通用近似理论以理解Transformer如何实现这一功能。与将Transformer视为算法逼近器的现有研究不同，本文采用基于通用函数逼近的方法，提供不依赖优化算法效果的逼近保证，从而超越了凸问题和线性函数类的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对Transformer的理解多集中于其作为算法逼近器的角色，但这种方法受限于优化算法的效果。为了更好地理解Transformer支持上下文内学习的能力，并拓展到更广泛的函数类和任务类型，需要一种新的理论框架。

Method: 提出了一种通用近似理论，展示如何为任意函数类（每个代表一个不同的任务）构建一个Transformer。该Transformer无需进一步权重更新即可根据少量上下文中提供的例子完成可靠预测。此方法基于通用函数逼近而非算法逼近。

Result: 证明了所提出的通用近似理论可以解释Transformer如何同时学习通用表示并动态适应上下文内例子。该方法提供了不受优化算法约束的逼近保证，并适用于更广泛的非凸问题和非线性函数类。

Conclusion: 本文通过通用函数逼近的视角，揭示了Transformer支持上下文内学习的机制。这一理论不仅加深了对Transformer工作原理的理解，还为未来设计更高效、更灵活的模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

*Jingyu Hu,Hongbo Bo,Jun Hong,Xiaowei Liu,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes HAR contrastive loss and SHARP framework to reduce degree bias in Graph Neural Networks for node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face the problem of degree bias in node classification tasks, leading to varied prediction performance across nodes with different degrees. Existing methods using Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) still result in low-degree nodes obtaining insufficient and noisy information due to limited positive pairs and equal weighting.

Method: The authors introduce Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss which leverages node labels to add more positive pairs and adaptively weights these pairs based on their learning hardness. They also develop an experimental framework called SHARP to extend HAR to a wider range of scenarios.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments confirm the effectiveness of SHARP. Experimental results from four datasets indicate that SHARP surpasses baselines in both global and degree levels.

Conclusion: HAR contrastive loss mitigates degree bias by adding more positive pairs and adaptively weighting them. The SHARP framework effectively extends this approach, achieving better performance in node classification tasks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and introduces a unified framework encompassing KernelSHAP and related estimators, demonstrating its effectiveness through benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley values are crucial for explaining machine learning model decisions, but exact computation is challenging. Existing randomized estimators like KernelSHAP lack strong theoretical guarantees.

Method: Developed a broad unified framework covering KernelSHAP and related estimators using different sampling strategies. Proved non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees applicable to all estimators within this framework.

Result: Validated the approach through benchmarking on small to medium dimensional datasets, achieving low mean squared error with modest sample sizes. Also demonstrated scalability and better performance on high-dimensional datasets compared to the KernelSHAP library.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and highlights tradeoffs between existing estimators, contributing significantly to the interpretability of machine learning models.

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

*Danil Sivtsov,Ivan Rodkin,Gleb Kuzmin,Yuri Kuratov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching is a scheduling scheme for RMTs that enables parallelism, reduces inference cost and latency, and strengthens RMTs for long-context applications without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face challenges with long-context inference due to quadratic time and linear memory complexity. While RMTs reduce this cost to linear time and constant memory usage, their memory update mechanism leads to sequential execution which causes a performance bottleneck.

Method: The paper introduces Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that allows parallelism across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence, thereby eliminating the sequential constraint and enabling efficient GPU inference for single long-context inputs.

Result: When applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching results in a 3.3x speedup over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences.

Conclusion: By removing the sequential bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, making RMTs a more practical solution for real-world, long-context applications.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential

bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context

*Severi Rissanen,RuiKang OuYang,Jiajun He,Wenlin Chen,Markus Heinonen,Arno Solin,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Recent research focuses on designing neural samplers, but they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach Parallel Tempering (PT) in terms of efficiency. To address this issue, the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD) is proposed, which trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures and combines high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate lower-temperature samples. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of target evaluations in sampling from unnormalized densities, addressing the shortcomings of both neural samplers and PT.

Method: The Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD) trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to improve the training of neural samplers. It also introduces a novel method to combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to train the next diffusion model.

Result: PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated samples. The method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency, outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Conclusion: PTSD addresses the weaknesses of both neural samplers and PT, offering a more efficient and effective approach to sampling from unnormalized densities.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过引入数值稳定且可并行化的Mesa层，优化了语言建模中的困惑度和下游任务性能，但增加了推理时的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前序列建模主要依赖于使用softmax自注意力机制的因果Transformer架构，尽管广泛采用，但其在推理过程中需要线性扩展内存和计算资源。最近的一些工作通过对softmax操作进行线性化处理，开发出了具有恒定内存和计算成本的强大RNN模型（如DeltaNet、Mamba或xLSTM）。这些模型都可以通过注意到它们的循环层动态可以从上下文内回归目标中推导出来而统一起来，大约通过在线学习规则进行优化。

Method: 研究者提出了一种数值稳定且可按块并行化的Mesa层版本，并在十亿参数规模的语言建模中对其进行了研究。该层源于一个上下文内的损失函数，但通过快速共轭梯度求解器在每个时间点将其最小化至最优值。

Result: 通过广泛的实验表明，最优的测试时训练能够实现比先前RNN更低的语言建模困惑度和更高的下游基准性能，特别是在需要长上下文理解的任务上。这种性能提升是以增加推理时的浮点运算为代价的。

Conclusion: 研究结果与近期通过增加测试时计算来提高性能的趋势密切相关——这里通过花费计算来解决神经网络内部的序列优化问题。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）是解释神经网络表示的强大工具，但现有的浅层架构隐式依赖于准正交假设，限制了提取相关特征的能力。

Method: 本文提出了一种基于Matching Pursuit展开的多迭代稀疏自编码器（MP-SAE）。该方法能够在残差引导下提取分层结构中的相关特征，并确保在选择更多原子时重建质量单调提升。

Result: 通过在MNIST数据集上的实验验证，证明了MP-SAE能够有效克服准正交假设的限制，提取出相关特征并提高重建性能。

Conclusion: 多迭代稀疏自编码器（MP-SAE）为提取复杂、相关特征提供了一种新的思路，其在分层结构中的表现优于传统的稀疏自编码器。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a computationally efficient method for aligning latent spaces with target distributions without expensive likelihood evaluations or ODE solving.

Method: Pretrain a flow model on target features, then use it to regularize the latent space via an alignment loss which reformulates the flow matching objective.

Result: The alignment loss landscape closely approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. The approach is effective in large-scale image generation experiments on ImageNet.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a new approach for latent space alignment, supported by both theoretical proof and empirical validation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Motivation: 现有的研究主要集中在Transformer的单独组件上，如自注意力机制和前馈网络，而对其组件间的相互依赖性，特别是残差连接的作用缺乏深入探讨。

Method: 分析了一个结构完整但仅包含单层的Transformer（包括自注意力、前馈网络和残差连接），研究其在适当初始化下的收敛行为，并探讨残差连接对输出矩阵条件的影响。

Result: 发现梯度下降具有线性收敛率，收敛速度由注意力层输出矩阵的最小和最大奇异值决定；残差连接可以改善由softmax操作引起的低秩结构问题，从而提高优化稳定性。此外，理论结果被扩展到多层Transformer架构，验证了类似的线性收敛特性。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析和实证研究，揭示了残差连接在促进Transformer模型优化稳定性中的重要作用，并为理解Transformer的训练动态提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop learning algorithms for deep state space models that align with physical principles, avoiding explicit Jacobian computation and variance in gradient estimation while maintaining scalability.

Method: Proposes RHEL which computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories. Introduces continuous-time RHEL equivalent to the adjoint state method and a discrete-time version compatible with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). Extends this to Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs) for scalability.

Result: RHEL matches the performance of BPTT across various models and tasks, including time-series classification and regression with sequence lengths up to ~50k.

Conclusion: RHEL provides a scalable and efficient approach for training HSSMs, opening possibilities for designing energy-efficient physical systems with self-learning capabilities.

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the

TL;DR: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, but controlling properties in generated sequences remains challenging. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling properties in generated time series sequences remains challenging and current methods struggle to provide both point-level constraints and segment-level controls while preserving temporal coherence.

Method: The CocktailEdit framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical properties such as sums and averages over segments.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving precise local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal coherence.

Conclusion: Our work bridges the gap between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs, offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

TL;DR: 在人工智能产业中，训练数据的价值和版权至关重要。本文提出了一种名为Fast-DataShapley的一次性训练方法，利用加权最小二乘法来训练可重复使用的解释模型，从而以实时推理速度计算训练数据的Shapley值，并提出了三种具有理论保证的方法来减少训练开销。实验结果表明，该方法在性能和效率上均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服务平台需要保护数据提供者的合法权益并公平地奖励他们的贡献，而Shapley值作为一种评估贡献的有效工具，虽然理论上优于其他方法，但其计算复杂度随着数据提供者数量的增加呈指数级增长。现有的基于Shapley值的工作尝试通过近似算法缓解计算复杂度，但需要为每个测试样本重新训练，导致成本过高。

Method: 提出了一种一次性训练方法Fast-DataShapley，利用加权最小二乘法来训练可重复使用的解释模型，无需重新训练即可计算训练数据的Shapley值。此外，还提出了三种具有理论保证的方法，从效用函数的近似计算和训练数据的组计算两个方面减少训练开销。

Result: 通过分析时间复杂度展示了所提方法的高效性。在多个图像数据集上的实验评估表明，与基线方法相比，该方法在性能和效率上均表现出色，性能提升了2.5倍以上，解释模型的训练速度提高了两个数量级。

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley方法能够有效降低Shapley值计算的计算复杂度，同时保持高性能和高效率，为训练数据价值评估提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: 水库计算可以在没有显式结构先验的情况下，通过对多轨迹训练，实现对未探索动力学区域的有效泛化。

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

*Arnav Kumar Jain,Vibhakar Mohta,Subin Kim,Atiksh Bhardwaj,Juntao Ren,Yunhai Feng,Sanjiban Choudhury,Gokul Swamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAILOR, a method using learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations to overcome the limitations of behavioral cloning (BC). It outperforms state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC and is robust to failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral cloning (BC) has a fundamental limitation where it only teaches an agent based on states visited by the expert, leading to issues when the agent encounters unseen situations. The motivation is to teach agents how to recover from mistakes and achieve expert outcomes in unseen test-time situations.

Method: Learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations is explored, including components like a world model and a reward model. This enables planning to match expert outcomes even after making a mistake. Careful ablation studies are conducted to combine these components for stable and efficient learning without additional human corrections.

Result: SAILOR consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data across various visual manipulation tasks. Even scaling up BC demonstrations by 5-10 times leaves a performance gap. SAILOR can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking.

Conclusion: SAILOR effectively addresses the limitations of BC by utilizing L2S, providing superior performance and robustness in recovery behavior without requiring additional human corrections.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the sample efficiency of test-time strategies for large language models (LLMs), establishes a separation result between self-consistency and best-of-$n$ sampling, presents an expressiveness result for self-correction with verifier feedback, and empirically validates these theoretical findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the theoretical underpinnings of the sample efficiency of various test-time strategies used to enhance the capabilities of LLMs on complex tasks.

Method: 1. Establish a separation result between self-consistency and best-of-$n$ repeated sampling strategies in terms of their sample requirements.
2. Present an expressiveness result for the self-correction approach using verifier feedback.
3. Empirically validate the theoretical results to demonstrate practical effectiveness.

Result: - Self-consistency requires $\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples, while best-of-$n$ needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$ samples.
- Self-correction with verifier feedback allows Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at test time.
- A single Transformer architecture can solve multiple tasks without knowing the specific task beforehand.

Conclusion: This work provides a deeper understanding of the sample efficiency of different test-time strategies for LLMs, highlights the advantages of best-of-$n$ over self-consistency in certain scenarios, and showcases the potential of self-correction methods in enabling multi-task solving capabilities.

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

*Nirav Koley,Prajwal Singhania,Abhinav Bhatele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient GPU inference with large language models is hindered by memory bandwidth limitations. SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method, addresses this issue by replacing expensive top-k operations with an efficient filtering operation based on a dynamic threshold value, reducing memory overhead while preserving model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient inference using large language models on GPUs is limited due to memory bandwidth constraints during data transfers between HBM and SRAM in attention computations. Existing approximate attention methods reduce computational and memory overhead but rely on costly top-k operations that perform poorly on GPUs.

Method: SiftAttention proposes an approximate attention method that replaces the top-k step with an element-wise filtering operation based on a threshold value. The threshold is dynamically estimated per prompt at each generation step based on the predictable power-law followed by the τ-th quantile of attention scores over sequential generation steps.

Result: SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when loading value vectors.

Conclusion: SiftAttention effectively reduces memory overhead during attention computations on GPUs, offering a promising solution for efficient inference with large language models.

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework for learning normalized energy models inspired by diffusion generative models, modifies score network architecture to compute energy while preserving inductive biases, optimizes using dual score matching objective, and validates approach on ImageNet64 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning probability models from data is difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. The authors aim to introduce a new framework that can learn normalized energy models effectively.

Method: The method involves modifying a score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising objective. Additionally, a novel secondary objective ensures consistent and normalized energies across noise levels.

Result: The energy network was trained on the ImageNet64 dataset using the dual score matching objective and achieved a cross-entropy value comparable to the state of the art. The model strongly generalizes with estimated log probabilities nearly independent of specific training images. It also demonstrates that image probability and dimensionality vary significantly with image content.

Conclusion: The authors successfully introduced a new framework for learning normalized energy models, validated it on the ImageNet64 dataset, and demonstrated its strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two techniques, difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay, to improve data efficiency in RL fine-tuning of LLMs. Extensive experiments show that these methods reduce RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning for large language models (LLMs) is highly resource-intensive and existing work largely overlooks the problem of data efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces two techniques: 1) difficulty-targeted online data selection which prioritizes questions of moderate difficulty using an attention-based framework; 2) rollout replay which reuses recent rollouts to reduce computation cost.

Result: Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations demonstrate that the proposed method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% compared to the original GRPO algorithm while reaching the same level of performance.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques significantly improve data efficiency in RL fine-tuning of LLMs, reducing the required time and resources.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper presents LSM-2 with AIM, a new SSL method using learnable mask tokens to handle incomplete wearable sensor data without explicit imputation. Pre-trained on 40M hours of data, it excels in various tasks and maintains high performance under targeted missingness scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable sensor data often has significant missing parts, which challenges traditional SSL models that assume complete data inputs.

Method: Introduced LSM-2 with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), utilizing learnable mask tokens for both existing and artificial missingness to robustly process fragmented real-world data.

Result: Achieves top performance in classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks, scales well, and performs effectively even under targeted missingness scenarios relevant to clinical applications.

Conclusion: LSM-2 with AIM is a dependable option for real-world wearable data applications due to its ability to maintain high performance despite data incompleteness.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

Motivation: 准粒子干涉(QPI)成像是探测量子材料电子结构的强大工具，但从多散射体图像中提取单散射体QPI模式仍是一个基本的不适定逆问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于AI的两步学习策略框架。第一步，训练变分自编码器以学习散射内核的紧凑潜在空间；第二步，使用专用编码器将QPI观测的潜在表示与预学习的内核对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相较于直接一步基线方法，实现了显著更高的提取准确性和对未见内核的更好泛化。

Conclusion: 所提出的AI框架为解决QPI内核提取这一不适定逆问题提供了一种有效的方法，特别是在复杂、纠缠的散射条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

Motivation: 以往基于计算最优的研究忽略了推理时间策略（如Best-of-N、长CoTs）引入的关键内存访问瓶颈，本文从实际效率角度重新审视测试时间扩展法则。

Method: 对0.6B到32B参数的模型进行全面分析，揭示出动力学扩展法则，指出测试时间计算在超过一定阈值的模型上比小型模型更有效；提出以稀疏注意力为中心的新扩展范式，降低每token成本并允许更长生成和平行样本。

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在低资源和高资源情况下均优于密集模型，在AIME问题解决准确性上提升显著；结果表明稀疏注意对于实现测试时间扩展的全部潜力至关重要。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是实现测试时间扩展潜力的关键，与训练中参数扩展饱和不同，测试时间准确率通过增加生成继续提高。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了通过嫁接预训练扩散变压器（DiTs）来设计新模型架构的方法，这种方法能在小计算预算下实现。研究者开发了一系列混合设计，这些设计在极少量的预训练计算资源下达到了良好的质量。此外，他们还通过嫁接一个文本到图像模型实现了速度提升，并展示了一个将顺序变换块转换为并行块的案例研究，这减少了模型深度并提高了质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计模型架构需要做出诸如选择操作符（如注意力、卷积）和配置（如深度、宽度）等决策。然而，评估这些决策对模型质量的影响需要昂贵的预训练过程，限制了架构探索的可能性。因此，研究者希望找到一种方法，可以利用预训练模型来研究新的架构设计。

Method: 研究者提出了嫁接方法，这是一种编辑预训练扩散变压器以实现新架构的方式。他们基于对激活行为和注意力局部性的分析，构建了一个基于DiT-XL/2设计的测试平台，用于研究嫁接对模型质量的影响。在这个平台上，他们开发了一系列混合设计，包括用门控卷积、局部注意力和线性注意力替代softmax注意力，以及用具有可变扩展比和卷积变体的MLPs替代原组件。

Result: 许多混合设计在使用不到2%的预训练计算资源的情况下，达到了良好的质量（FID：2.38-2.64对比DiT-XL/2的2.27）。对于一个文本到图像模型（PixArt-Sigma），通过嫁接实现了1.43倍的速度提升，且GenEval分数下降不到2%。此外，在一个案例研究中，通过将每对顺序变换块转换为并行块，模型深度减少了两倍，并获得了更好的质量（FID：2.77）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过嫁接预训练扩散变压器，可以在较小的计算预算下探索新的扩散模型设计，这些修改可以从操作符替换延伸到架构重组。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

TL;DR: 通过压缩KV缓存，动态内存稀疏化（DMS）方法在不增加推理时间和内存负载的情况下，显著提高了多种LLM模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管推理时扩展可以通过生成更长或更多并行序列来提高推理准确性，但在Transformer大语言模型中，生成成本受制于键值（KV）缓存大小而非生成令牌数量。因此需要探索一种新的方法，在相同的计算预算内生成更多令牌以进一步提高推理准确性。

Method: 提出了一种称为推理时超级扩展的方法，通过压缩KV缓存实现更多的令牌生成。为使此方法实用，引入了动态内存稀疏化（DMS），这是一种仅需1K训练步骤即可达到8倍压缩的方法，并且其准确性优于无需训练的稀疏注意力方法。DMS通过延迟令牌驱逐，隐式合并表示并保留关键信息。

Result: 在多个LLM系列上展示了推理时超级扩展与DMS的有效性，表明其在相似的推理运行时间和内存负载下提高了准确性。例如，在不同的计算预算下，Qwen-R1 32B在AIME 24、GPQA和LiveCodeBench上的表现分别平均提升了9.1、7.6和9.6分。

Conclusion: 动态内存稀疏化（DMS）方法成功实现了推理时超级扩展，提高了LLM模型的推理准确性，同时保持了相似的推理运行时间和内存负载。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

*Christos Karapapas,Iakovos Pittaras,George C. Polyzos,Constantinos Patsakis*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores how malicious actors can exploit IPFS to upload and disseminate harmful content while remaining anonymous, finding that pinning services and public gateways lack mechanisms to assess or restrict the propagation of malicious content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential misuse of IPFS by malicious actors who can upload and disseminate harmful content while remaining anonymous.

Method: Evaluate the role of pinning services and public gateways in maintaining content availability by using scripts to systematically test their behavior when uploading malicious files.

Result: Pinning services and public gateways lack mechanisms to assess or restrict the propagation of malicious content on IPFS.

Conclusion: IPFS, while promising resilience and efficiency, poses risks due to the anonymity it offers which can be exploited for malicious purposes.

Abstract: The InterPlanetary File System~(IPFS) offers a decentralized approach to file
storage and sharing, promising resilience and efficiency while also realizing
the Web3 paradigm. Simultaneously, the offered anonymity raises significant
questions about potential misuse. In this study, we explore methods that
malicious actors can exploit IPFS to upload and disseminate harmful content
while remaining anonymous. We evaluate the role of pinning services and public
gateways, identifying their capabilities and limitations in maintaining content
availability. Using scripts, we systematically test the behavior of these
services by uploading malicious files. Our analysis reveals that pinning
services and public gateways lack mechanisms to assess or restrict the
propagation of malicious content.

### [161] [The Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR) Problem: From Symbolic Path Inversion to Post-Quantum Cryptographic Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04383)
*Mohamed Aly Bouke*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR), a new cryptographic method using fractal behavior and hash functions for secure key generation without algebraic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical cryptographic systems are becoming vulnerable to quantum attacks and structural cryptanalysis due to their reliance on structured algebraic problems like factorization, discrete logarithms, or lattice-based assumptions.

Method: The HFKR problem is introduced, which uses symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. It builds upon the Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP) with symbolic trajectories generated via contractive affine maps over Z^2 and compresses them into fixed-length keys using hash-based obfuscation. The fractal behavior of these paths is confirmed empirically.

Result: Experimental results from 250 trials indicate that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 effectively amplify symbolic divergence achieving high mean Hamming distances and ideal bit-flip rates with negligible entropy deviation. BLAKE3 shows weaker diffusion. The observed fractal dimension stabilizes near 1.06, indicating self-similarity and complexity.

Conclusion: HFKR offers post-quantum security through the combination of symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy amplification, providing a lightweight, structure-free foundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings.

Abstract: Classical cryptographic systems rely heavily on structured algebraic
problems, such as factorization, discrete logarithms, or lattice-based
assumptions, which are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks and
structural cryptanalysis. In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal
Key Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction
grounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the
Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories
generated via contractive affine maps over $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them
into fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key
contribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic
paths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path
geometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension
increases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic
self-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the
entropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation
trials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively,
achieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible
entropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but
weaker diffusion. These findings confirm that HFKR post-quantum security arises
from the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy
amplification. The resulting construction offers a lightweight, structure-free
foundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings without relying on
algebraic hardness assumptions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 在注入被污染片段的检索生成系统攻击中，即使污染率很低，现有攻击手段也容易被检测和防御。本文通过引入归一化段落注意力分数的概念提出了一种Attention-Variance Filter算法来识别并过滤可能被污染的段落，该方法比基线防御提高了约20%的准确率。同时，为了探索基于注意力防御的极限，我们设计了更隐蔽的自适应攻击，使攻击成功率高达35%，并强调改进隐秘性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）系统容易受到注入被污染片段的攻击，但目前的攻击手段缺乏隐蔽性，容易被检测和防御。因此，需要研究如何在攻击时避免留下明显的操作痕迹，以提高攻击的隐秘性。

Method: 1. 提出一个段落级别的分数——归一化段落注意力分数，并基于此分数构建Attention-Variance Filter算法，用于识别和过滤潜在的被污染段落。
2. 设计更隐蔽的自适应攻击，通过分析生成过程中的中间信号（如注意力模式或下一个令牌的概率分布），掩盖操纵痕迹，测试基于注意力的防御系统的极限。

Result: 1. Attention-Variance Filter算法能够有效缓解现有攻击，将准确率提高约20%。
2. 新设计的隐蔽自适应攻击成功率达到35%，证明了提高攻击隐秘性的可能性及挑战。

Conclusion: 本文展示了现有攻击手段由于缺乏隐蔽性而容易被检测和防御，并提出了基于注意力模式的防御算法（Attention-Variance Filter）。同时，通过设计更隐蔽的自适应攻击，揭示了基于注意力防御的局限性和未来改进的方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

*Payel Bhattacharjee,Fengwei Tian,Ravi Tandon,Joseph Lo,Heidi Hanson,Geoffrey Rubin,Nirav Merchant,John Gounley*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for fine-tuning large language models with differential privacy for multi-abnormality classification on radiology reports. Using DP-LoRA, it achieves a balance between privacy and utility across two datasets and three model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of maintaining privacy while fine-tuning large language models on sensitive medical data, specifically radiology reports, for multi-abnormality classification.

Method: The method involves using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) to fine-tune LLMs with differential privacy on two datasets (MIMIC-CXR and CT-RATE) across different privacy budgets. The performance is evaluated using weighted F1 scores across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base.

Result: A clear privacy-utility trade-off was observed. Under moderate privacy guarantees, DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78 respectively.

Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA effectively enables privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports, offering a solution for fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

*Xuhao Ren,Haotian Liang,Yajie Wang,Chuan Zhang,Zehui Xiong,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces BESA, a new method to improve encoder stealing attacks by detecting and recovering perturbations applied by defense mechanisms, leading to a significant increase in attack accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome perturbation-based defenses that hinder the performance of encoder stealing attacks.

Method: BESA consists of two modules: perturbation detection and perturbation recovery. The detection module infers the defense mechanism from feature vectors, while the recovery module uses a generative model to restore clean vectors from perturbed ones.

Result: BESA improves surrogate encoder accuracy by up to 24.63% over existing attacks when facing state-of-the-art defenses and combinations of multiple defenses, as shown through extensive evaluations on various datasets.

Conclusion: BESA significantly enhances the effectiveness of encoder stealing attacks against perturbation-based defenses.

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

### [165] [Incentivizing Collaborative Breach Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04634)
*Mridu Nanda,Michael K. Reiter*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes and evaluates an algorithm that allows sites to exchange monitoring favors for detecting breaches through decoy passwords (honeywords). The authors conduct a model-checking analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm, quantify parameter impacts on detection, and validate scalability using a real dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue where attackers can identify user-chosen passwords among honeywords by credential stuffing across different sites, thus undermining the effectiveness of honeywords. This work aims to create incentives for sites to monitor each other's honeyword usage to enhance breach detection.

Method: The authors propose an algorithm enabling sites to exchange monitoring efforts. They perform a model-checking analysis to show how increasing monitoring effort improves breach detection. Additionally, they evaluate various parameters affecting detection effectiveness and analyze performance on a real dataset of breached credentials.

Result: The model-checking analysis confirms that increased monitoring effort leads to better breach detection capabilities. Parameter quantification provides insights into system deployment for a monitoring ecosystem. The performance analysis on the real dataset demonstrates the algorithm's scalability and practicality.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully incentivizes sites to monitor each other's honeyword usage, improving breach detection capabilities. The findings support the practical deployment of a system fostering a cooperative monitoring ecosystem.

Abstract: Decoy passwords, or "honeywords," alert a site to its breach if they are ever
entered in a login attempt on that site. However, an attacker can identify a
user-chosen password from among the decoys, without risk of alerting the site
to its breach, by performing credential stuffing, i.e., entering the stolen
passwords at another site where the same user reused her password. Prior work
has thus proposed that sites monitor for the entry of their honeywords at other
sites. Unfortunately, it is not clear what incentives sites have to participate
in this monitoring. In this paper we propose and evaluate an algorithm by which
sites can exchange monitoring favors. Through a model-checking analysis, we
show that using our algorithm, a site improves its ability to detect its own
breach when it increases the monitoring effort it expends for other sites. We
additionally quantify the impacts of various parameters on detection
effectiveness and their implications for the deployment of a system to support
a monitoring ecosystem. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on a real dataset of
breached credentials and provide a performance analysis that confirms its
scalability and practical viability.

*Zixian Gong,Zhiyong Zheng,Zhe Hu,Kun Tian,Yi Zhang,Zhedanov Oleksiy,Fengxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Private Set Intersection (PSI) is improved with data integrity protection through authenticated schemes based on Merkle Trees, offering secure two-party and multi-party protocols at the cost of higher computation and communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PSI protocols lack protection against data integrity attacks, where malicious actors may gain unauthorized information or mislead others during set intersection computations.

Method: The authors define data integrity in PSI and create two authenticated PSI schemes by combining Merkle Trees with existing state-of-the-art volePSI (two-party) and mPSI (multi-party) protocols. These schemes incorporate integrity verification to prevent malicious activities.

Result: The two-party authenticated PSI achieves a communication complexity comparable to the best unauthenticated PSI schemes ($\mathcal{O}(n \lambda+n \log n)$), while the multi-party version has slightly more overhead ($\mathcal{O}(n \kappa+n \log n)$) due to the use of Merkle tree inclusion proofs.

Conclusion: Although the authenticated PSI schemes introduce higher costs compared to unauthenticated ones, they provide essential data integrity protection. The paper also discusses efficient implementations and suggests areas for future improvements.

Abstract: Private Set Intersection (PSI) enables secure computation of set
intersections while preserving participant privacy, standard PSI existing
protocols remain vulnerable to data integrity attacks allowing malicious
participants to extract additional intersection information or mislead other
parties. In this paper, we propose the definition of data integrity in PSI and
construct two authenticated PSI schemes by integrating Merkle Trees with
state-of-the-art two-party volePSI and multi-party mPSI protocols. The
resulting two-party authenticated PSI achieves communication complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n \lambda+n \log n)$, aligning with the best-known unauthenticated
PSI schemes, while the multi-party construction is $\mathcal{O}(n \kappa+n \log
n)$ which introduces additional overhead due to Merkle tree inclusion proofs.
Due to the incorporation of integrity verification, our authenticated schemes
incur higher costs compared to state-of-the-art unauthenticated schemes. We
also provide efficient implementations of our protocols and discuss potential
improvements, including alternative authentication blocks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MULTISS is a new protocol for long-term storage across multiple QKD networks using hierarchical secret sharing, ensuring perfect security and allowing updates without reconstructing the entire secret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the secure storage capabilities of LINCOS to multiple QKD networks while enhancing security against potential network compromises.

Method: Using hierarchical secret sharing to distribute secrets across multiple QKD networks and enabling partial secret updates without full reconstruction.

Result: MULTISS proves to be strictly more secure than LINCOS, especially in scenarios where individual QKD networks might be compromised.

Conclusion: MULTISS provides an advanced solution for secure, long-term storage distributed over multiple QKD networks with enhanced security features.

Abstract: This paper presents MULTISS, a new protocol for long-term storage distributed
across multiple Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks. This protocol is an
extension of LINCOS, a secure storage protocol that uses Shamir secret sharing
for secret storage on a single QKD network. Our protocol uses hierarchical
secret sharing to distribute a secret across multiple QKD networks while
ensuring perfect security. Our protocol further allows for sharing updates
without having to reconstruct the entire secret. We also prove that MULTISS is
strictly more secure than LINCOS, which remains vulnerable when its QKD network
is compromised.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework using LLMs and RAG for automating attack mitigation policy compliance, showing improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern computing environments are complex and cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated, requiring more robust, adaptive, and automated security measures.

Method: The framework collects and manages tool and API specifications in a vector database, decomposes high-level mitigation policies into tasks, and translates them into actionable API calls using a combination of in-context learning and RAG.

Result: Empirical evaluation with CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation shows significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs and RAG for automating attack mitigation policy compliance can lead to more effective security enforcement.

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving smart wallet with an invitation-based private onboarding mechanism is proposed, integrating compliance measures like proof of innocence and ancestral commitment tracking via bloom filters. It ensures efficient private transfers, minimal on-chain costs, and maintains transaction unlinkability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a privacy-preserving digital payment system that incorporates compliance checks while minimizing computational and financial overhead.

Method: The solution includes an invitation-based private onboarding mechanism, proof of innocence, ancestral commitment tracking using bloom filters for UTXO chain states, encrypted data blobs for private contact list management, and ensures transaction unlinkability.

Result: Private transfers with compliance checks complete within seconds on standard laptops, proof generation remains low, and on-chain costs are minimal, making operations affordable on Base layer 2 network.

Conclusion: The approach is viable for privacy-preserving, compliance-aware digital payments with minimized computational and financial overhead.

Abstract: We propose a privacy-preserving smart wallet with a novel invitation-based
private onboarding mechanism. The solution integrates two levels of compliance
in concert with an authority party: a proof of innocence mechanism and an
ancestral commitment tracking system using bloom filters for probabilistic UTXO
chain states. Performance analysis demonstrates practical efficiency: private
transfers with compliance checks complete within seconds on a consumer-grade
laptop, and overall with proof generation remaining low. On-chain costs stay
minimal, ensuring affordability for all operations on Base layer 2 network. The
wallet facilitates private contact list management through encrypted data blobs
while maintaining transaction unlinkability. Our evaluation validates the
approach's viability for privacy-preserving, compliance-aware digital payments
with minimized computational and financial overhead.

### [170] [PoCGen: Generating Proof-of-Concept Exploits for Vulnerabilities in Npm Packages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04962)
*Deniz Simsek,Aryaz Eghbali,Michael Pradel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PoCGen is a new method that automatically creates and checks proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for software vulnerabilities in npm packages using large language models combined with static and dynamic analysis techniques. It effectively generates exploits for many vulnerabilities, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security vulnerabilities in software are critical issues that need timely patches to maintain system integrity. However, vulnerability reports often lack PoC exploits which are necessary for fixing vulnerabilities and testing patches. Creating these PoCs is difficult due to incomplete reports and the complexity of understanding how inputs reach security-sensitive sinks.

Method: The paper introduces PoCGen, an approach that uses large language models along with static and dynamic analysis techniques to autonomously generate and validate PoC exploits. The LLM interprets vulnerability reports, generates candidate PoC exploits, and refines them.

Result: PoCGen successfully generated exploits for 77% of vulnerabilities in the SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a newer, more challenging dataset of recent vulnerabilities, surpassing a recent baseline by 45 absolute percentage points. The average cost per exploit generated was $0.02.

Conclusion: PoCGen represents a significant advancement in the autonomous generation of PoC exploits for software vulnerabilities, enhancing the ability to address security issues efficiently.

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in software packages are a significant concern for
developers and users alike. Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner
is crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.
However, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack
proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the
vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC
exploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often
incomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs
passed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In
this paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and
validate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first
fully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with
static and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen
leverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating
candidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach
successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the
SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent
vulnerabilities. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline
(by 45 absolute percentage points), while imposing an average cost of $0.02 per
generated exploit.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight, client-side query obfuscation strategy using multilingual random queries to protect user privacy from search engine profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks and filter bubbles caused by personalized search results based on detailed user profiles.

Method: Evaluation of a query obfuscation strategy that inserts randomly generated multilingual search queries into real searches, tested through controlled experiments on Seznam.cz.

Result: Obfuscation significantly alters perceived user interests without disrupting actual search results, effectively preventing accurate user profiling.

Conclusion: Query obfuscation is a practical, privacy-preserving mechanism; a tool is introduced for users to autonomously protect their search behavior.

Abstract: Modern search engines extensively personalize results by building detailed
user profiles based on query history and behaviour. While personalization can
enhance relevance, it introduces privacy risks and can lead to filter bubbles.
This paper proposes and evaluates a lightweight, client-side query obfuscation
strategy using randomly generated multilingual search queries to disrupt user
profiling. Through controlled experiments on the Seznam.cz search engine, we
assess the impact of interleaving real queries with obfuscating noise in
various language configurations and ratios. Our findings show that while
displayed search results remain largely stable, the search engine's identified
user interests shift significantly under obfuscation. We further demonstrate
that such random queries can prevent accurate profiling and overwrite
established user profiles. This study provides practical evidence for query
obfuscation as a viable privacy-preserving mechanism and introduces a tool that
enables users to autonomously protect their search behaviour without modifying
existing infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges posed by data-intensive machine learning in conjunction with emerging technologies such as V2X and 5G communication, and to explore the feasibility of deploying Federated Learning solutions in the vehicular intrusion detection domain.

Method: The authors propose a Federated Learning implementation of a state-of-the-art Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Network based on LSTM autoencoders. They evaluate its detection efficiency and communication overhead in comparison to a centralized version of the same algorithm.

Result: The proposed Federated Learning implementation demonstrates comparable detection efficiency to the centralized version while reducing communication overhead, thus presenting itself as a feasible solution for vehicular intrusion detection.

Conclusion: Federated Learning can be effectively integrated into machine learning-based intrusion detection processes for on-board vehicular networks, offering a balance between detection performance and communication efficiency.

Abstract: The challenges derived from the data-intensive nature of machine learning in
conjunction with technologies that enable novel paradigms such as V2X and the
potential offered by 5G communication, allow and justify the deployment of
Federated Learning (FL) solutions in the vehicular intrusion detection domain.
In this paper, we investigate the effects of integrating FL strategies into the
machine learning-based intrusion detection process for on-board vehicular
networks. Accordingly, we propose a FL implementation of a state-of-the-art
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Controller Area Network (CAN), based on
LSTM autoencoders. We thoroughly evaluate its detection efficiency and
communication overhead, comparing it to a centralized version of the same
algorithm, thereby presenting it as a feasible solution.

Conclusion: Focus-based designs significantly enhance detection performance.

Abstract: Traditional security detection methods face three key challenges: inadequate
data collection that misses critical security events, resource-intensive
monitoring systems, and poor detection algorithms with high false positive
rates. We present FEAD (Focus-Enhanced Attack Detection), a framework that
addresses these issues through three innovations: (1) an attack model-driven
approach that extracts security-critical monitoring items from online attack
reports for comprehensive coverage; (2) efficient task decomposition that
optimally distributes monitoring across existing collectors to minimize
overhead; and (3) locality-aware anomaly analysis that leverages the clustering
behavior of malicious activities in provenance graphs to improve detection
accuracy. Evaluations demonstrate FEAD achieves 8.23% higher F1-score than
existing solutions with only 5.4% overhead, confirming that focus-based designs
significantly enhance detection performance.

*Robert J. Joyce,Gideon Miller,Phil Roth,Richard Zak,Elliott Zaresky-Williams,Hyrum Anderson,Edward Raff,James Holt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EMBER2024 is a new dataset for malware analysis, expanding on previous EMBER datasets with more files, formats, tasks, and the first 'challenge' set of evasive malware. It promotes reproducibility and advances in malware research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historically, malware analysis research has been constrained by limited accessible data. Existing public datasets have narrow scope, targeting single platforms, supporting only one type of classification task, and lacking representation of evasive files that complicate real-world malware detection.

Method: Created in collaboration with authors of previous EMBER datasets, EMBER2024 includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors, and labels for over 3.2 million files across six formats. It supports seven malware classification tasks and introduces a 'challenge' set of initially undetected malicious files. Also, it features EMBER feature version 3 with added support for new feature types.

Result: EMBER2024 enables holistic evaluation of malware classifiers, providing a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models on various classification tasks, including detection, family classification, and behavior identification.

Conclusion: The release of EMBER2024 aims to promote reproducibility in malware research and empower researchers to explore new topics, addressing limitations of prior datasets through its expanded scope and inclusion of evasive malware.

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

### [175] [Membership Inference Attacks on Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05126)
*Lorenzo Rossi,Michael Aerni,Jie Zhang,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Sequence models like LLMs and autoregressive image generators tend to memorize and leak sensitive information. Current tools for assessing this risk are inadequate. The authors suggest that these tools fail because they don't properly account for the sequential nature of these models. They adapt a membership inference attack to model within-sequence correlations, improving the effectiveness of memorization audits without extra computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need to effectively measure privacy leakage in sequence models, as current tools are insufficient due to mismatched assumptions about the sequential generation process.

Method: The method involves adapting a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model within-sequence correlations, aligning with the structure of sequence models.

Result: This adaptation consistently improves the effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional computational costs.

Conclusion: The work provides an important step towards reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

*Andrin Bertschi,Shweta Shinde*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenCCA, an open research platform enabling execution of Arm CCA-bound code on commodity Armv8.2 hardware to address the lack of hardware support for researching Arm CCA, which leads to duplicated efforts and inconsistent performance comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researching Arm CCA faces challenges due to the absence of hardware support, causing researchers to develop ad-hoc performance prototypes on non-CCA Arm boards that lead to duplicated efforts, inconsistent performance comparisons, and high barriers to entry.

Method: By systematically adapting the software stack including bootloader, firmware, hypervisor, and kernel, OpenCCA emulates CCA operations for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness.

Result: OpenCCA effectively enables the execution of CCA-bound code on commodity Armv8.2 hardware, demonstrated through typical life-cycle measurements and case-studies inspired by prior CCA-based papers on a easily available Armv8.2 Rockchip board.

Conclusion: OpenCCA addresses the challenge of researching Arm CCA without hardware support, providing a consistent and accessible platform for performance evaluation.

Abstract: Confidential computing has gained traction across major architectures with
Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and Arm CCA. Unlike TDX and SEV-SNP, a key challenge in
researching Arm CCA is the absence of hardware support, forcing researchers to
develop ad-hoc performance prototypes on non-CCA Arm boards. This approach
leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent performance comparisons, and high
barriers to entry. To address this, we present OpenCCA, an open research
platform that enables the execution of CCA-bound code on commodity Armv8.2
hardware. By systematically adapting the software stack -- including
bootloader, firmware, hypervisor, and kernel -- OpenCCA emulates CCA operations
for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness. We
demonstrate its effectiveness with typical life-cycle measurements and
case-studies inspired by prior CCA-based papers on a easily available Armv8.2
Rockchip board that costs $250.

*Zhiqiang Wang,Haohua Du,Junyang Wang,Haifeng Sun,Kaiwen Guo,Haikuo Yu,Chao Liu,Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SECNEURON is a framework that embeds access control within LLMs to prevent abuse in local environments. It uses neuron-level encryption and selective decryption, ensuring secure and controlled LLM capabilities with minimal authorized performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local deployment of LLMs presents security challenges as they operate outside direct developer control, leading to potential abuse. Current mitigation techniques designed for cloud-based services are often ineffective in deployer-controlled environments.

Method: SECNEURON employs neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to dynamically control task-specific LLM capabilities. It includes a task-specific neuron extraction mechanism, a hybrid encryption framework, and a detection mechanism to ensure effectiveness of partially decrypted LLMs.

Result: Experiments show that SECNEURON limits unauthorized task accuracy to below 25% while maintaining authorized accuracy with only a 2% loss. It also significantly reduces malicious code generation and mitigates unauthorized data leakage.

Conclusion: SECNEURON provides reliable, cost-effective, flexible, and certified abuse control for locally deployed LLMs, satisfying strong security principles and effectively limiting unauthorized tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities are increasingly being
deployed in local environments, presenting significant security and
controllability challenges. These locally deployed LLMs operate outside the
direct control of developers, rendering them more susceptible to abuse.
Existing mitigation techniques mainly designed for cloud-based LLM services are
frequently circumvented or ineffective in deployer-controlled environments. We
propose SECNEURON, the first framework that seamlessly embeds classic access
control within the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs, achieving reliable,
cost-effective, flexible, and certified abuse control for local deployed LLMs.
SECNEURON employs neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to
dynamically control the task-specific capabilities of LLMs, limiting
unauthorized task abuse without compromising others. We first design a
task-specific neuron extraction mechanism to decouple logically related neurons
and construct a layered policy tree for handling coupled neurons. We then
introduce a flexible and efficient hybrid encryption framework for millions of
neurons in LLMs. Finally, we developed a distribution-based decrypted neuron
detection mechanism on ciphertext to ensure the effectiveness of partially
decrypted LLMs. We proved that SECNEURON satisfies IND-CPA Security and
Collusion Resistance Security under the Task Controllability Principle.
Experiments on various task settings show that SECNEURON limits unauthorized
task accuracy to below 25% while keeping authorized accuracy loss with 2%.
Using an unauthorized Code task example, the accuracy of abuse-related
malicious code generation was reduced from 59% to 15%. SECNEURON also mitigates
unauthorized data leakage, reducing PII extraction rates to below 5% and
membership inference to random guesses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Big Bird is a privacy budget manager for Privacy-Preserving Attribution (PPA) that introduces per-site and global budgeting systems, enforces utility-preserving limits, and improves budget utilization through batched scheduling. It was implemented in Firefox and proved effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving advertising APIs such as PPA aim to enhance web privacy while allowing effective ad measurement. However, there is currently no principled approach to managing the privacy budget, leading to uncertainty in critical design decisions.

Method: Big Bird provides clear per-site budget semantics and a global budgeting system based on resource isolation principles. It enforces utility-preserving limits using quota budgets and enhances global budget utilization via a novel batched scheduling algorithm.

Result: The implementation of Big Bird in Firefox and its evaluation on real-world ad data demonstrated its resilience and effectiveness in enforcing privacy protections even in adversarial environments.

Conclusion: Big Bird establishes a robust framework for privacy protection enforcement in PPA by introducing systematic privacy budget management and efficient budget utilization mechanisms.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving advertising APIs like Privacy-Preserving Attribution (PPA)
are designed to enhance web privacy while enabling effective ad measurement.
PPA offers an alternative to cross-site tracking with encrypted reports
governed by differential privacy (DP), but current designs lack a principled
approach to privacy budget management, creating uncertainty around critical
design decisions. We present Big Bird, a privacy budget manager for PPA that
clarifies per-site budget semantics and introduces a global budgeting system
grounded in resource isolation principles. Big Bird enforces utility-preserving
limits via quota budgets and improves global budget utilization through a novel
batched scheduling algorithm. Together, these mechanisms establish a robust
foundation for enforcing privacy protections in adversarial environments. We
implement Big Bird in Firefox and evaluate it on real-world ad data,
demonstrating its resilience and effectiveness.

### [179] [Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05346)
*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in LLMs have shown their vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, especially after downstream fine-tuning. Current mitigation strategies mainly focus on addressing jailbreak incidents after they happen or during fine-tuning. This paper investigates the degradation of safety guardrails through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Experiments show that high similarity weakens safety guardrails while low similarity yields more robust models. Findings highlight the importance of upstream dataset design for reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the overlooked upstream factor in the vulnerability of LLMs to safety alignment jailbreaks, specifically the role of the original safety-alignment data.

Method: The method involves investigating the degradation of safety guardrails through analyzing the representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks.

Result: The results demonstrate that high similarity significantly weakens safety guardrails, making models more susceptible to jailbreaks, while low similarity leads to more robust models and reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that upstream dataset design plays a crucial role in building durable safety guardrails and reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, providing actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

### [180] [Tech-ASan: Two-stage check for Address Sanitizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05022)
*Yixuan Cao,Yuhong Feng,Huafeng Li,Chongyi Huang,Fangcao Jian,Haoran Li,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tech-ASan, a technique that accelerates Address Sanitizer (ASan) while ensuring safety. It uses a two-stage check algorithm to reduce shadow memory accesses and an optimizer to eliminate redundant checks. Implemented in LLVM, it shows significant improvements in runtime overhead and false negatives compared to ASan and ASan--.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the runtime overhead issue of Address Sanitizer (ASan), which limits its efficiency in testing large software due to frequent and expensive shadow memory access.

Method: Proposes Tech-ASan with a two-stage check algorithm using magic value comparison to reduce costly shadow memory accesses and an efficient optimizer to remove redundant checks, including those in loops.

Result: Tech-ASan has 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan and ASan--, respectively, and detects 56 fewer false negative cases on the Juliet Test Suite.

Conclusion: Tech-ASan effectively accelerates ASan while maintaining detection capabilities.

Abstract: Address Sanitizer (ASan) is a sharp weapon for detecting memory safety
violations, including temporal and spatial errors hidden in C/C++ programs
during execution. However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which
limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from
sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over
the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by
eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to
adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To
address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based
technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel
two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to
reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an
efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel
algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a
memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation
using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan
and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative
cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same
redzone setting.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Pre-trained language models CodeBERT and CodeT5 are explored for automated vulnerability patching. CodeBERT performs better with fragmented context, while CodeT5 captures complex patterns and shows superior scalability. Fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance but generalization to unseen data remains a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, yet the aspect of vulnerability patching within Automated Program Repair (APR) has not been extensively explored.

Method: Investigate the use of pre-trained language models CodeBERT and CodeT5 for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets and four languages. Evaluate their accuracy and generalization capabilities to unknown vulnerabilities. Test both fine-tuned and unfine-tuned models on in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets.

Result: CodeBERT performs comparatively better in scenarios with fragmented or sparse context whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns and demonstrates superior scalability. Fine-tuning enhances in-distribution performance but models still struggle with generalizing to unseen data.

Conclusion: This study benchmarks the performance of CodeBERT and CodeT5 for automated vulnerability patching, identifies limitations in generalization, and provides insights that can guide future advancements in this field.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

*Oussama Ben Sghaier,Rosalia Tufano,Gabriele Bavota,Houari Sahraoui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoRAL, a deep learning framework that uses reinforcement learning to automate code review comment generation. It compares the generated comments with latest baseline techniques, proving its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is crucial but time consuming, subjective and influenced by human factors. Automating code review using deep learning can tackle generative aspects like comment generation and code refinement.

Method: CoRAL exploits reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering semantics of generated comments and their usefulness for code refinement models.

Result: CoRAL outperforms latest baseline techniques as shown through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.

Conclusion: CoRAL is an effective deep learning framework for automating code review comment generation.

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing that overcomes limitations of previous DNA-chemistry focused tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a proper open-source tool for chemically-inspired reservoir computing due to limitations in previous studies focused on DNA chemistry.

Method: Development of ChemReservoir, a general open-source framework for constructing and analyzing chemically-inspired reservoirs, with enhanced testing, evaluation, and reproducibility.

Result: ChemReservoir demonstrated stable performance across various configurations in memory capacity tasks when evaluated using cycle-based reservoir topologies.

Conclusion: ChemReservoir provides a versatile and reliable platform for chemically-inspired reservoir computing, overcoming previous limitations.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Neural ODE的数据驱动框架，用于从由PDE控制的系统中学习简化的矩动力学。该方法在数据稀疏和不规则的情况下表现出色，能够准确恢复有闭合条件的矩动力学，并通过Stiefel流形优化策略发现低维表示以实现无解析闭合条件系统的可靠建模。实验表明，在Fisher-KPP反应扩散系统等没有已知闭合模型的情况下，Neural ODE仍能有效逼近矩动力学并提供更精确的外推结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的导数方法（如SINDy）需要密集采样数据且对噪声敏感，因此难以处理稀疏或不规则的时间序列数据。此外，许多复杂系统缺乏明确的解析闭合条件，这限制了传统物理专家推导ODE模型的适用性。

Method: 采用Neural ODE框架直接模拟矩轨迹，从而克服了对密集数据的需求并提高了对噪声的鲁棒性。对于没有解析闭合条件的系统，引入了基于Stiefel流形优化的数据驱动坐标变换策略，以发现使矩动力学闭合的低维表示。最后，通过非线性Schrödinger方程和Fisher-KPP反应扩散系统验证了该方法的有效性。

Result: 在有闭合条件的系统中，框架能够准确恢复矩动力学；在无解析闭合条件的系统中，通过Stiefel流形优化策略发现了低维闭合表示，实现了可靠的建模。与基于物理专家知识的ODE模型相比，Neural ODE在稀疏和不规则采样的情况下表现出更高的外推精度。

Conclusion: Neural ODE框架是一种强大且灵活的工具，适用于从复杂PDE系统中学习可解释的、低维的矩动力学，尤其在数据受限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

*Conor Rowan,John Evans,Kurt Maute,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Eigenvalue analysis is important in engineering but underexplored in physics-informed machine learning. The abstract introduces a method using the Rayleigh quotient and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization with neural network discretization to solve eigenvalue problems, offering advantages for continuous problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eigenvalue problems are crucial in engineering applications but have received less attention in the physics-informed machine learning literature, especially concerning neural network discretizations.

Method: The method employs a variational form of the eigenvalue problem (Rayleigh quotient) combined with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization and neural network discretization of the eigenfunction to solve eigenvalue problems.

Result: This approach is effective for finding harmonic functions on irregular domains, solving parametric and nonlinear eigenproblems, and conducting high-dimensional eigenanalysis. It also shows potential in using harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating solutions to partial differential equations.

Conclusion: The combination of the Rayleigh quotient, Gram-Schmidt procedure, and neural network discretization provides unique advantages for handling continuous eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

TL;DR: The paper presents cGSA, an AI-driven framework that enhances gene set analysis by incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GSA methods lack clinical context, leading to redundant or irrelevant results that require extensive manual effort to interpret, reducing reliability and reproducibility.

Method: cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify pathways that are both statistically significant and biologically meaningful.

Result: Benchmarking on 102 gene sets across 19 diseases shows cGSA outperforms baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its precision and interpretability. Case studies in melanoma and breast cancer demonstrate its potential for uncovering context-specific insights.

Conclusion: cGSA addresses limitations of conventional GSA methods by incorporating clinical context, improving the precision and interpretability of gene set analysis.

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases

### [187] [Benchmark for Antibody Binding Affinity Maturation and Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04235)
*Xinyan Zhao,Yi-Ching Tang,Akshita Singh,Victor J Cantu,KwanHo An,Junseok Lee,Adam E Stogsdill,Ashwin Kumar Ramesh,Zhiqiang An,Xiaoqian Jiang,Yejin Kim*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces AbBiBench, a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing strategies, AbBiBench considers an antibody-antigen complex as a functional unit. The authors curate 9 datasets with 155,853 heavy chain mutated antibodies and compare 14 protein models. Structure-conditioned inverse folding models perform the best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current antibody evaluation strategies rely on antibody alone and its similarity to natural ones, which is not sufficient for evaluating the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen.

Method: AbBiBench considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. They systematically compare 14 protein models using curated datasets.

Result: Structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks.

Conclusion: AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

### [188] [The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515)
*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Latent Space Hypothesis to unify diverse medical data by projecting them into a shared geometric space, allowing for personalized diagnosis and treatment while acknowledging challenges like bias and causation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical data come in various forms, yet many encode information about the same underlying physiological state. The authors aim to create a unified framework to interpret these heterogeneous data sources.

Method: The Latent Space Hypothesis is introduced, which treats each observation as a projection of a unified manifold. This allows health status, disease progression, and therapeutic intervention to be represented geometrically.

Result: This approach reveals sub-trajectories and patient-specific changes, providing a quantitative basis for personalized medicine and moving away from grouping patients by broad labels.

Conclusion: While challenges exist, such as bias and data scarcity, potential solutions include scale-aware encoders, continual learning, and perturbation-based validation.

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper develops a high-speed numerical simulator, TQml Simulator, for Quantum Machine Learning circuits by benchmarking universal and gate-specific techniques. It achieves significant performance gains over Pennylane's default.qubit simulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine Learning algorithms by numerically benchmarking different simulation techniques for layers of gates in hardware-efficient circuits.

Method: Numerical benchmarking of universal and gate-specific techniques for simulating gate layers on quantum state vectors, leading to the development of TQml Simulator which uses the most efficient method for each layer.

Result: TQml Simulator outperforms Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by 2- to 100-fold, depending on various factors such as circuit type, number of qubits, batch size, and hardware.

Conclusion: A tailored combination of simulation techniques can significantly enhance the performance of Quantum Machine Learning circuit simulations.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The GAIN model employs a grid-based structure for better biological plausibility and dynamics, enhancing interactions between neurons akin to biological systems. Combined with the Izhikevich model, it provides a computationally efficient and accurate simulation method for neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more biologically plausible and dynamic neural network model by focusing on neuron interactions similar to those in biological systems.

Method: Using a grid-based structure in the GAIN model to allow neurons to interact with their closest neighbors, combined with the Izhikevich model for simulation.

Result: This approach results in a computationally efficient and biologically accurate simulation that can be used in neural network development, large scale simulations, and neuroscience research.

Conclusion: The adaptation of the Izhikevich model within the GAIN framework improves both the dynamics and accuracy of neural simulations, making them specialized yet efficient.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale
simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of
the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: POSSM是一种新的混合架构，结合了交叉注意力模块和循环状态空间模型，用于快速因果在线预测神经活动和高效泛化。它在保持与Transformer相当的解码精度的同时，显著降低了推理成本（高达9倍更快）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经解码方法要么速度快但泛化能力差（如简单循环神经网络），要么泛化能力强但计算需求高（如基于Transformer的方法），不适用于实时或低资源场景。因此需要一种兼顾速度、准确性和泛化能力的新方法。

Method: POSSM通过交叉注意力模块对单个脉冲进行标记化，并使用循环状态空间模型作为主干网络，结合多数据集预训练实现快速因果在线预测和高效泛化。评估时使用猴类运动任务的皮层内解码以及人类书写的临床应用。

Result: POSSM在猴类运动任务和人类书写/语音解码中表现出色，其解码精度与最先进的Transformer相当，但推理速度提高了9倍（GPU上）。此外，跨物种预训练（如猴类数据）可以提高人类任务的解码性能。

Conclusion: POSSM作为一种混合SSM架构，为实时闭环神经解码应用提供了准确性、推理速度和泛化能力之间的良好平衡，展现了巨大的潜力。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

*Osayamen Jonathan Aimuyo,Byungsoo Oh,Rachee Singh*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashDMoE是一种完全驻留在GPU上的MoE操作符，通过融合专家计算和GPU间通信到单一持久的GPU内核中，实现了更高效的模型训练。相比现有方法，在8-H100 GPU节点上，FlashDMoE在处理多达128个专家和16K令牌序列的MoE模型时，能够显著降低延迟、提高吞吐量、改进弱扩展效率以及提升GPU利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型实现存在GPU利用率低、延迟高以及无法充分利用任务局部性的缺点，这些问题主要源于CPU管理调度、主机发起通信和频繁的内核启动。因此需要一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 开发了FlashDMoE，一个完全驻留在GPU上的MoE操作符，它将专家计算和GPU间通信融合到一个单一持久的GPU内核中。此方法允许对分发、计算和组合阶段进行细粒度流水线处理，消除启动开销并减少空闲间隔。其设备发起的通信协议引入了数据传输的有效载荷，大幅缩减了稀疏激活MoE层中的缓冲区大小。

Result: 在单个8-H100 GPU节点上评估，针对最多128个专家和16K令牌序列的MoE模型，FlashDMoE实现了最高6倍更低的延迟、5.7倍更高的吞吐量、4倍更好的弱扩展效率和9倍更高的GPU利用率，尽管使用FP32而基线使用FP16。

Conclusion: FlashDMoE证明了原则性的GPU内核-硬件协同设计对于解锁大规模分布式机器学习工作负载的性能上限至关重要。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed to improve the speed and accuracy of dose calculation in IMPT by denoising low-statistics Monte Carlo dose maps. Trained on head and neck data, it generalized well across multiple cancer sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is sensitive to anatomical changes requiring frequent adaptation through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast, accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo simulations. Reducing particle count for faster calculation degrades accuracy, necessitating a method to denoise low-statistics dose maps.

Method: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed. It used IMPT plans and 3D CT images from 80 head and neck patients to generate noisy and high-statistics dose maps. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss function. Testing was done on various cancer cases.

Result: The model achieved low mean absolute errors (MAEs) across different cancer sites and had 3D Gamma passing rates exceeding 92% (3%/2mm). Dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices closely matched the ground truth for clinical target volumes and organs at risk.

Conclusion: The developed diffusion transformer-based denoising framework not only enhances the efficiency and quality of dose calculation in IMPT but also demonstrates good generalization ability across multiple disease sites despite being trained solely on head and neck data.

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain

*Hasin Us Sami,Swapneel Sen,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury,Srikanth V. Krishnamurthy,Basak Guler*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: In this paper, authors investigate a potential privacy issue in Federated Learning when using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods. They show that through gradient inversion attacks on adapter modules, it's possible to reconstruct user data from shared gradients, thus compromising privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to identify and address a privacy risk in the Federated Learning setting where PEFT techniques are used. Even though only gradients of lightweight adapter modules are shared, these gradients could potentially leak sensitive information about the local data.

Method: The method involves demonstrating gradient inversion attacks on adapter modules in PEFT mechanisms. By utilizing only the accessible gradients of these adapters, the authors attempt to reconstruct the local data samples used for fine-tuning by target users.

Result: The results indicate that it is feasible to retrieve a large batch of fine-tuning images with high fidelity using the proposed attack approach.

Conclusion: This work concludes that there is a significant need for privacy-preserving mechanisms within PEFT frameworks in Federated Learning environments, suggesting several directions for future research.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

*Junpyo Seo,Hanbin Koo,Jieun Yook,Byung-Ro Moon*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A new diffusion-based framework named SSIMBaD is proposed for automatic Anime-style facial sketch colorization, outperforming existing models in accuracy and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for colorizing Anime-style facial sketches often suffer from perceptual inconsistency due to reliance on predefined noise schedules.

Method: The method uses continuous-time diffusion models with a novel approach called SSIMBaD (Sigma Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion) that applies sigma-space transformation to maintain uniform visual difficulty across timesteps.

Result: Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset show superior performance over state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and perceptual quality, with good generalization to diverse styles.

Conclusion: SSIMBaD provides a more balanced and faithful way of colorizing Anime-style facial sketches compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 通过引入GARG-AML方法，该研究提供了一种平衡计算效率、检测能力和透明性的反洗钱解决方案。实验表明，这种方法在大规模合成和开源网络中优于现有最先进的smurfing检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洗钱活动对全球经济构成重大威胁，而smurfing作为一种隐蔽的洗钱手段，增加了金融监管的难度。当前的反洗钱方法多依赖于黑箱模型，缺乏透明性，限制了其在实际业务中的应用。因此，需要一种既有效又可解释的方法来量化和检测smurfing风险。

Result: 实验结果表明，GARG-AML在大规模合成和开源网络上显著优于现有的smurfing检测方法。此外，研究表明基本网络属性在提升欺诈检测方面具有巨大潜力。

Conclusion: GARG-AML提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持高检测性能的同时确保透明性和计算效率，有助于将其整合到现有的反洗钱工作流程中。

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

### [200] [Spore in the Wild: Case Study on Spore.fun, a Real-World Experiment of Sovereign Agent Open-ended Evolution on Blockchain with TEEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04236)
*Botao Amber Hu,Helena Rong*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: To explore the possibility of achieving Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) in Artificial Life (ALife) systems, this paper presents a case study of Spore.fun. Unlike traditional closed system simulations that have failed to sustain OEE, Spore.fun leverages decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) and large language model (LLM)-based AI agents operating on blockchain with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These on-chain agents can autonomously interact with their environment through social media and financial networks. The study examines agent behaviors and evolutionary trajectories via digital ethology, aiming to stimulate discussion on whether open ALife systems could finally achieve sustained OEE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to overcome the limitations of previous closed system simulations such as Tierra and Avida, which have failed to maintain continuous novelty required for Open-Ended Evolution (OEE). It explores if an 'open' system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment could better facilitate OEE.

Method: The method involves deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), allowing them to operate autonomously without human oversight. The study focuses on Spore.fun, a real-world AI evolution experiment where these agents can breed and evolve autonomously while interacting with blockchain-based financial networks and human social media.

Result: The result is a detailed case study of Spore.fun, providing insights into the behaviors and evolutionary trajectories of the on-chain agents through digital ethology. This analysis contributes to the discourse on whether open ALife systems based on permissionless computational substrates could achieve sustained OEE.

Conclusion: The conclusion suggests that open ALife systems 'in-the-wild,' leveraging permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, hold promise for achieving the long-sought goal of Open-Ended Evolution (OEE). Further exploration and discussion in this area are encouraged.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

### [201] [CORA: Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition for Multi-Agent Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04265)
*Mengda Ji,Genjiu Xu,Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper addresses the credit assignment problem in cooperative MARL by introducing CORA, a method that evaluates coalitional advantages through marginal contributions and decomposes them using cooperative game theory's core solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates by analyzing it from a coalition-level perspective.

Method: Proposed CORA method evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory with random coalition sampling to reduce computational overhead.

Result: Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks show that CORA outperforms strong baselines, especially in tasks with multiple local optima.

Conclusion: Coalition-aware credit assignment is crucial for enhancing MARL performance.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

### [202] [Autonomous Collaborative Scheduling of Time-dependent UAVs, Workers and Vehicles for Crowdsensing in Disaster Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04276)
*Lei Han,Yitong Guo,Pengfei Yang,Zhiyong Yu,Liang Wang,Quan Wang,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper introduces HoAs-PALN, an algorithm for efficient post-disaster environmental information collection via autonomous collaboration among UAVs, workers, and vehicles. It uses adaptive dimensionality reduction and local Nash equilibrium game to enhance sensing scheduling, resulting in significant improvements in task completion rates compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters cause significant losses and timely acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is crucial for rescue operations. Current sensing technologies struggle with weak adaptability, insufficient specialized capabilities, and limited practicality.

Method: HoAs-PALN employs adaptive dimensionality reduction to transform a five-dimensional matching process into two categories of three-dimensional processes, reducing scheduling decision time. It also incorporates a local Nash equilibrium game that combines the softmax function for optimizing behavior selection probabilities and introduces a determination mechanism for ensuring decision performance.

Result: Experiments based on real-world and simulated data show that HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%, and 14.03% compared to GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL, and MARL respectively, with each online scheduling decision taking less than 10 seconds.

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN demonstrates effectiveness in dynamic post-disaster environments, significantly enhancing task completion rates while maintaining fast decision-making.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

### [203] [Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309)
*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，该代理不仅决定说什么，还决定何时说话。通过在线Mafia游戏数据集评估，该代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当。研究发现，代理在决定何时说话的行为上接近人类模式，但在消息内容上存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型（LLMs）主要用于同步通信，而在许多现实世界的场景中，通信是异步的，例如群聊、在线团队会议或社交游戏中。在这种情况下，决定何时发言是参与者决策的重要部分。因此，研究者希望开发一种能够适应异步环境的LLM代理。

Method: 研究者开发了一个自适应异步LLM代理，它不仅能决定说什么，还能决定何时说。为了评估这个代理的表现，他们收集了一个独特的在线Mafia游戏数据集，其中包含人类玩家和异步代理。

Result: 总体而言，该代理在游戏表现上与人类玩家相当，并且能够很好地融入其他人类玩家之中。分析表明，代理在决定何时说话的行为上紧密模仿了人类模式，尽管在消息内容上存在一些差异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为将LLMs整合到真实的人类群体环境中铺平了道路，从团队讨论的帮助到需要导航复杂社会动态的教育和专业环境中都有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

### [204] [Was Residual Penalty and Neural Operators All We Needed for Solving Optimal Control Problems?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04742)
*Oliver G. S. Lundqvist,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes a simplified approach to solve multiple optimal control problems using a neural operator architecture (like DeepONet) with physics-informed training and unconstrained optimization, showcasing accurate performance across nine distinct problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to simplify the process of solving optimal control problems by decoupling the cost functions from the neural network training process, thus avoiding the complexity of combining them into a single loss function.

Method: The method involves training a neural operator architecture, such as DeepONet, with physics-informed data. An unconstrained optimization routine is then applied, where a penalty term based on the differential equation residual is added to the cost function. Automatic differentiation is used through the trained neural operator to compute gradients with respect to the control within an iterative optimization process.

Result: The method was tested on nine distinct optimal control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding to a different differential equation. Each model solved three problems with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance in all cases.

Conclusion: A simpler architecture and streamlined approach can effectively solve multiple optimal control problems by decoupling the training process from the optimal control problem itself. This approach uses a neural operator architecture combined with an unconstrained optimization routine.

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

TL;DR: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm MOPBnB(so) is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and efficient frontier, which outperforms NSGA-II in numerical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a new method for solving stochastic multi-objective optimization problems that is more efficient than existing methods.

Method: MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions. It has a finite-time performance analysis for deterministic problems and asymptotic convergence on stochastic problems.

Result: Numerical results reveal that MOPBnB(so) is less computationally intensive than a variant with multiple replications and outperforms NSGA-II on test problems.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so) is an effective algorithm for approximating the Pareto optimal set and efficient frontier in stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

### [206] [Reason-to-Recommend: Using Interaction-of-Thought Reasoning to Enhance LLM Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05069)
*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes R2Rec, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that leverages LLMs for improved and interpretable recommendations through a two-stage training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the ineffectiveness of directly applying advanced reasoning methods from fields like mathematics and code to recommendation systems due to implicit user feedback and lack of reasoning supervision.

Method: R2Rec samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy. It uses a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning to refine reasoning.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that R2Rec outperforms classical and LLM-based baselines with an average 10.48% improvement in HitRatio@1 and 131.81% gain over the original LLM.

Conclusion: R2Rec is a novel approach that enhances recommendation performance and interpretability by leveraging stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction context.

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

*Emiliano Acevedo,Martín Rocamora,Magdalena Fuentes*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper identifies the problem of audio-text models' performance dropping in zero-shot environmental sound classification due to background sounds, proposes a novel method to integrate background source contributions without retraining, enhances accuracy through domain adaptation, and narrows the modality gap between audio and text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the severe drop in performance of audio-text models when classifying environmental sounds in the presence of background sound sources, which is primarily driven by SNR levels and not dependent on the type of background sound.

Method: The proposed method quantifies and integrates the contribution of background sources into the classification process. It also involves analyzing and narrowing the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, enhancing classification performance without requiring model retraining.

Result: The domain adaptation technique improves accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. The method effectively generalizes across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, demonstrating scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

Conclusion: Audio-text models face challenges with background sounds in zero-shot classification. A new method was developed to enhance performance by integrating background source contributions and narrowing the audio-text embedding gap, showing effectiveness across different conditions and models.

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

TL;DR: AI音乐生成快速发展，但因数据集固定难以准确响应用户输入。本文提出基于用户交互的人类计算方法改进算法性能，通过遗传算法结合用户反馈优化模型，试点测试中迭代两次分别提升了0.2和0.39的平均评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI音乐生成技术如扩散模型和自回归算法已实现高保真输出，但由于训练数据集固定，这些算法在理解和响应用户输入方面存在挑战，而音乐的主观性要求更高的个性化程度。

Method: 提出了一种人类计算方法，通过聚合和选择用户评分作为损失函数来微调模型，并采用遗传算法将用户反馈纳入其中，以逐步提高基于固定数据集预训练模型的性能。

Result: 在试点测试中，第一次迭代相比基线提升了0.2的平均评分，第二次迭代进一步提升了0.39的评分。

Conclusion: 通过结合用户反馈和遗传算法，可以有效提升音乐生成模型的个性化表现和整体性能。

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an expansion-based approach for Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from QBF solutions, and embeds it in an optimization framework to address multistage robust discrete optimization problems. Experimental results show superior performance compared to existing solvers.

Motivation: To develop a more efficient method for solving QIP problems by leveraging the advantages of expansion-based approaches adapted from QBF solutions, which have not been previously explored for QIP and QCSP.

Method: Adapting CEGAR methodology from QBF solutions to create an expansion-based approach for QIP, extending this methodology to handle multistage robust discrete optimization problems with linear constraints, and embedding it within an optimization framework.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances and achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

Conclusion: An expansion-based approach using CEGAR is successfully developed for QIP, providing a versatile and powerful tool for solving complex decision-making scenarios and multistage robust discrete optimization problems.

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

Motivation: To accurately estimate soil properties such as diffusivity and hydraulic conductivity from water moisture measurements.

Method: Simulated data is generated by solving initial-boundary value problem using the Fokas method. Various machine learning models are then explored for a two-output regression task to identify parameters.

Result: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) show the highest robustness in predicting soil properties under different data conditions.

Conclusion: SVMs and NNs are recommended for their near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors in predicting soil properties.

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of the esports and multiplayer online gaming community
has highlighted the critical importance of evaluating the Most Valuable Player
(MVP). The establishment of an explainable and practical MVP evaluation method
is very challenging. In our study, we specifically focus on play-by-play data,
which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We
aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework,
denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses
feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP
ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we
optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective
of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through
validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and
implemented online deployment in the industry.

### [213] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the effects of watermarking techniques on the core alignment properties (truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness) of large language models and to mitigate any degradation caused by these techniques.

Method: The authors conduct experiments on four aligned LLMs using two popular watermarking approaches (Gumbel and KGW). They identify degradation patterns and propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore alignment. They also establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in expected reward score with increased sample size.

Result: Sampling 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers or surpasses baseline alignment scores. The modified Gumbel watermarking implementation maintains robust detectability while sacrificing strict distortion-freeness, ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches while maintaining strong watermark detectability.

Conclusion: This work reveals the critical balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show great potential, but current evaluation benchmarks focus on STEM-related reasoning and lack emphasis on Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). To address this, the paper introduces HSSBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' performance in HSS tasks across multiple languages. It includes over 13,000 samples covering six key categories and highlights challenges even for state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' capabilities in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS), which require interdisciplinary thinking and deep integration of knowledge across related fields.

Method: The method involves introducing HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages. It also includes a novel data generation pipeline where domain experts and automated agents collaborate to create and refine samples.

Result: HSSBench contains over 13,000 carefully designed samples covering six key categories. The benchmark shows that even state-of-the-art MLLMs face significant challenges in HSS tasks.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that HSSBench provides a valuable tool for assessing and improving MLLMs' cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities, particularly their capacity to connect knowledge across fields.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sentence embeddings are crucial in NLP and AI, but their internal structure is not well understood. This paper proposes a method to decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of the internal structure of sentence embeddings and make them more transparent and controllable.

Method: Propose a new method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. Analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding.

Result: Obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence embedding spaces, such as many semantic and syntactic aspects being linearly encoded in the embeddings.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, making sentence embeddings more transparent and controllable.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [216] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great performance in various NLP tasks, but their effectiveness for low-resource languages is limited. This study evaluates 55 LLMs on Maltese using a new benchmark covering 11 tasks. Experiments show that many models perform poorly on generative tasks and smaller fine-tuned models often perform better. Prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning is the most important factor impacting performance. Fine-tuning yields better performance and lower inference costs compared to prompting, despite higher initial cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of LLMs on low-resource languages and identify factors that impact their performance.

Method: Evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 discriminative and generative tasks.

Result: Many models perform poorly, especially on generative tasks, and smaller fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. Prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning is the most important factor impacting performance.

Conclusion: There is a need for more inclusive language technologies. Researchers working with low-resource languages should consider more 'traditional' language modelling approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 人类规模的语言模型在处理罕见的英语LET-ALONE结构时，虽然能感知其形式，但无法正确泛化其意义，显示出语言形式和意义之间的样本效率不对称。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类规模的预训练语言模型是否具备像人类一样的能力，从常见语言构造泛化到罕见构造，并进一步探讨这种泛化能力是否适用于语义层面。

Method: 使用定制的合成基准测试方法，针对罕见的英语LET-ALONE结构的语言形式和意义，评估人类规模的Transformer语言模型。

Result: 人类规模的语言模型对形式敏感，即使过滤掉相关构造的数据集后仍如此，但未能正确泛化LET-ALONE结构的意义。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义上的样本效率存在不对称性，而这种不对称性在人类语言学习者中并不存在。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the ability of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of the English discourse particle 'just', revealing that while they can differentiate broader categories, they struggle with more subtle nuances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how well LLMs can understand and differentiate the nuanced meanings of the discourse particle 'just' as created and labeled by expert linguists.

Method: Using meticulously created and labeled data by expert linguists to test LLMs' capacity to distinguish the fine-grained senses of the English word 'just'.

Result: LLMs show some ability to differentiate between broader categories of 'just' but struggle with capturing more subtle nuances.

Conclusion: There is a gap in LLMs' understanding of discourse particles like 'just', indicating a need for further improvement in their comprehension of such linguistic elements.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated dataset for evaluating machine translation quality in 13 African language pairs. Based on this data, the authors developed improved metrics SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, which outperform existing methods like AfriCOMET especially for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating machine translation quality in under-resourced African languages suffer from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings. Recent efforts such as AfriCOMET still have constraints including small evaluation sets and inconsistent performance in extremely low-resource scenarios.

Method: The authors introduced SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation dataset covering 13 African language pairs with over 63,000 sentence-level annotations. They developed two metrics based on this dataset: SSA-COMET (reference-based) and SSA-COMET-QE (reference-free). They also benchmarked prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: SSA-COMET models significantly outperformed AfriCOMET and were competitive with the strongest LLM evaluated in the study, particularly on low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

Conclusion: The authors released all resources under open licenses to support future research. SSA-COMET is an effective metric for evaluating machine translation quality in under-resourced African languages.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

TL;DR: 研究了大语言模型（LLMs）在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性，发现并非所有推理方式都能提高性能，GPT-4o在无链式思维提示时表现最佳，且快速直观的思考方式比缓慢审慎的推理更贴近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型及其提示策略在金融情感分析任务中的表现，探讨不同类型的推理模型和提示方法对任务效果的影响。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，比较三种专有LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）与两种较小模型（FinBERT-Prosus、FinBERT-Tone），通过模拟系统1（快速直观）或系统2（缓慢审慎）思考方式进行测试，并分析语言复杂性和标注一致性对结果的影响。

Result: 推理无论是通过提示还是模型设计本身，都没有提高在这个任务上的表现；GPT-4o在没有任何链式思维提示时最为准确且与人类判断一致；高推理可能导致过度思考从而产生次优预测。

Conclusion: 对于金融情感分类任务，快速直观的思考方式比缓慢审慎的推理更贴近人类判断，挑战了更多推理总是能带来更好LLM决策的默认假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automatic fact-checking via retrieval-augmented language models struggles with adversarial claims. This paper proposes SUCEA, a training-free method that rephrases claims to better locate evidence through three steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction. Experiments show it improves retrieval and label accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fact-checking systems have difficulty dealing with adversarial claims which are specifically designed to challenge these systems.

Method: The SUCEA framework is introduced which includes: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization to break down claims; Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing to retrieve evidence and edit sub-claims; Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction to aggregate evidence and predict labels.

Result: Experiments on two challenging datasets show significant improvements in retrieval and entailment label accuracy compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: SUCEA significantly enhances the performance of fact-checking systems when dealing with adversarial claims.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

*Chengwu Liu,Ye Yuan,Yichun Yin,Yan Xu,Xin Xu,Zaoyu Chen,Yasheng Wang,Lifeng Shang,Qun Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework $Safe$ to identify hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning from large language models (LLMs). It uses Lean 4 to articulate mathematical claims and provide formal proofs. The framework shows significant performance improvement and offers interpretable evidence. They also introduce $FormalStep$, a benchmark for theorem proving with 30,809 formal statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to mitigate hallucinations in CoT reasoning from LLMs operate as opaque boxes without providing checkable evidence for their judgments, which may limit their effectiveness.

Method: The method involves using the formal verification framework $Safe$ that strives to articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations.

Result: The framework $Safe$ demonstrates a significant performance improvement across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence.

Conclusion: The work represents the first endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal mathematical languages were created.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

*Ziyi Zhou,Xiaoming Zhang,Litian Zhang,Yibo Zhang,Zhenyu Guan,Chaozhuo Li,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 为了应对社交媒体上假新闻的广泛传播及其对社会产生的严重影响，本文提出了一种新的连续协作式突发假新闻检测（C²EFND）框架。该框架通过多轮协作学习机制结合大语言模型（LLMs）的泛化能力和小语言模型（SLMs）的分类能力，并引入基于混合专家架构的终身知识编辑模块和基于回放的持续学习方法来解决现有方法中的问题。实验结果表明，C²EFND在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上显著优于现有方法，提高了检测准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法中，小语言模型需要大量监督训练且难以适应变化的新闻环境，而大语言模型尽管具有强大的零样本能力，但在假新闻检测方面表现不佳，主要由于知识过时和缺乏适当的示范。这促使了对更高效、适应性更强的假新闻检测方法的需求。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为C²EFND的新框架，利用多轮协作学习机制整合LLMs的泛化能力和SLMs的分类专长。同时，引入了一个基于混合专家架构的终身知识编辑模块以逐步更新LLMs，并采用基于回放的持续学习方法确保SLMs在无需完全重新训练的情况下保留先前的知识。

Result: 广泛的实验验证表明，C²EFND框架在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上显著优于现有方法，在连续突发假新闻场景中有效提升了检测准确率和适应能力。

Conclusion: C²EFND框架成功解决了传统方法在假新闻检测中的不足，通过结合LLMs和SLMs的优势以及引入有效的持续学习机制，实现了更高的检测精度和更好的适应性，为假新闻检测领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过设计四维政治学习框架和构建细粒度政治概念向量数据集，使用可解释的表示工程技术来解析大语言模型（LLMs）内部的政治状态，并验证了这些向量在检测、干预任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLMs政治观点研究主要依赖于其开放性回答的评估，但近期研究表明LLMs的回答与其内部意图存在偏差，因此需要探查LLMs的内部机制以揭示其内部政治状态。此外，单轴概念分析可能导致概念混淆，需扩展到多维度分析。

Method: 设计了一个四维政治学习框架，并构建了相应的数据集进行细粒度政治概念向量学习。使用三种表示工程技术对八个开源LLMs进行实验，向量可用于检测和干预LLMs内部机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些向量可以解析政治概念混淆，在检测任务中验证了语义意义并表现出良好的泛化和鲁棒性，干预实验显示这些向量能够使LLMs生成具有不同政治倾向的回答。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多维政治概念向量学习方法可以有效解析和干预LLMs的政治观点，为更透明地理解LLMs内部政治状态提供了新途径。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant gap in existing literature regarding the systematic understanding of how different modalities connect to the language backbone in MLLMs.

Method: Conducting a survey that examines methods for transforming and aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space and proposing a classification framework for MLLMs based on three key dimensions: architectural strategies, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms.

Result: Identification of emerging patterns in the field by examining 125 MLLMs developed between 2021 and 2025, providing researchers with a structured overview of current integration techniques.

Conclusion: The insights from the survey aim to guide the development of more robust multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained foundations.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Logical reasoning is crucial for LLMs. Existing benchmarks focus on final-answer accuracy, neglecting reasoning quality. FineLogic evaluates logical reasoning in LLMs across three dimensions: benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. A study on supervision formats during fine-tuning reveals natural language supervision enhances generalization, while symbolic styles improve structural soundness. Probing shows fine-tuning improves reasoning via step-by-step generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing benchmarks that only focus on final-answer accuracy and fail to capture the quality and structure of the reasoning process in LLMs.

Method: Propose FineLogic, a framework evaluating LLMs' logical reasoning through benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. Conduct a comprehensive study by constructing four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic variants) to analyze their effects during fine-tuning.

Result: Natural language supervision leads to strong generalization in diverse tasks, while symbolic reasoning promotes more structurally sound inference chains. Fine-tuning primarily enhances reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation rather than shortcut prediction.

Conclusion: FineLogic provides a rigorous and interpretable way to evaluate and improve logical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

### [231] [A Reasoning-Based Approach to Cryptic Crossword Clue Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04824)
*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an LLM-based reasoning system that solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesising answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and using a verifier system. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks with new test sets released daily globally. There is a need for a system that can solve these clues effectively.

Method: The system solves cryptic clues through three steps: (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified reasoning steps.

Result: The system establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and The Telegraph newspapers in the UK.

Conclusion: This LLM-based reasoning system successfully solves cryptic crossword clues and provides interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers expressed in Python.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

*Giorgio Biancini,Alessio Ferrato,Carla Limongelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the potential of three LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5) in generating Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) for educational assessment by injecting specific knowledge into prompts rather than relying on the LLM's inherent knowledge. The study finds GPT-3.5 most effective in MCQ generation and highlights educators' reluctance to adopt AI tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive nature of manually creating MCQs and explore the capabilities of LLMs in educational settings, specifically in generating effective MCQs while giving educators control over the source text.

Method: Conduct a comparative analysis of Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 by injecting knowledge into prompts rather than using the LLM's inherent knowledge to generate MCQs. Evaluate the generated MCQs using known metrics and gather feedback from 21 educators.

Result: GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs according to several known metrics. The study also reveals some hesitation among educators to adopt AI technologies in education.

Conclusion: LLMs hold significant potential for generating MCQs and improving educational experiences. However, there remains a need to address educators' concerns and hesitations regarding AI adoption.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with nested narrative reasoning, and existing benchmarks inadequately test this. The paper introduces Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that forces internal computation and state management of nested reasoning problems, revealing LLMs' difficulty in state management for nested sub-reasoning. Experiments show leading LLMs' performance collapses on Verbose ListOps at modest narrative lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in nested narrative reasoning and provide a more adequate testing method than existing benchmarks.

Method: Introduction of Verbose ListOps, a benchmark that programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent stories, forcing internal computation and state management of nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results.

Result: Experiments reveal that leading LLMs perform poorly on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths, despite easily solving raw ListOps equations.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps and its generation framework enable targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere context-window expansion, marking a critical step towards automating knowledge work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions using LLMs, exploring 352 experimental settings across 11 languages and 4 LLMs. Results show that multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, especially in low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the ability of LLMs to provide effective instructional support across different languages for mathematically grounded reasoning tasks, which has not been thoroughly studied before.

Method: A stronger LLM plays the role of the tutor generating feedback in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. The study explores 352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies.

Result: Multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native language.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical insights for developing effective and inclusive multilingual, LLM-based educational tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

### [237] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）能够生成类似自我反省的报告，但这些报告并不一定表明模型具有真正的内省能力或意识。本文探讨了两个例子：一个LLM尝试描述其'创造性'写作过程，这不应被视为有效的内省；另一个LLM正确推断出其自身的温度参数值，这可以被视为最小程度内省的例子，但不伴随有意识体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在语言能力和认知能力上的提升，它们有时会生成关于自身性质、内部运作或行为的陈述（即自我报告）。由于人类的此类报告通常与内省和意识相关，因此需要探讨如何解释LLMs生成的自我报告，并研究内省概念是否能有意义地应用于LLMs。

Method: 文章通过分析两个实例来探讨LLMs的内省能力：第一个实例中，LLM试图描述其“创造性”写作的过程；第二个实例中，LLM正确推测出其自身的温度参数值。通过对这两个实例的分析，评估它们是否可以被合理地视为内省的例子。

Result: 第一个例子中，LLM对'创造性'写作过程的描述被认为不是有效内省的例子；而在第二个例子中，LLM对其温度参数值的正确推测则被认为是内省的最小示例，但此内省不伴随有意识体验。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs表现出类似于人类内省的行为，但这些行为并不意味着LLMs具有真正的内省能力或意识。本文认为，在某些情况下，LLMs的行为可能可以被视作最低限度的内省，但这与人类的内省和意识有着本质区别。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

### [238] [DiCoRe: Enhancing Zero-shot Event Detection via Divergent-Convergent LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05128)
*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe is a new framework for zero-shot Event Detection which uses divergent and convergent reasoning to improve event coverage and precision. It consistently outperforms previous methods across various datasets and language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for zero-shot Event Detection overload Large Language Models by requiring them to understand complex event ontologies, extract domain-specific triggers, and structure them appropriately. This limits their utility.

Method: The proposed method, DiCoRe, decouples the task of Event Detection using Dreamer and Grounder. Dreamer promotes open-ended event discovery for better coverage while Grounder ensures predictions align with task-specific instructions via constrained decoding. An LLM-Judge is also used to verify outputs for high precision.

Result: DiCoRe outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 score improvements over the best baseline.

Conclusion: DiCoRe establishes itself as a robust zero-shot Event Detection framework through its consistent performance improvements across multiple datasets and language models.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

TL;DR: This paper conducts the first in-depth analysis of how large audio-language models (LALMs) perceive and recognize auditory attributes, revealing key insights into their internal mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LALMs internally perceive and recognize auditory attributes to improve model performance and interpretability.

Method: Apply vocabulary projection on three state-of-the-art LALMs to track attribute information evolution across layers and token positions. Analyze reliance on querying auditory inputs versus aggregating information in hidden states.

Result: Attribute information generally decreases with layer depth when recognition fails. Resolving attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. LALMs rely more on querying auditory inputs than aggregating information in hidden states.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into auditory attribute processing by LALMs and suggest a method to enhance these models, paving the way for future improvements.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

*Bhavik Chandna,Zubair Bashir,Procheta Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过机制可解释性方法研究了大型语言模型（如GPT-2和Llama2）中的人口统计和性别偏见的结构性表示。发现偏见相关计算高度集中于少数层，且在不同微调设置下有所变化。去除这些组件虽能减少偏见输出，但也影响其他NLP任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型已知存在社会、人口统计和性别偏见，这通常是由训练数据导致的。为了理解这些偏见是如何在模型内部结构化表示的，本文采用机制可解释性方法进行分析。

Method: 研究聚焦于人口统计和性别偏见，使用不同的度量标准来识别导致偏见行为的内部边缘。评估这些组成部分在数据集和语言变化中的稳定性、定位性和泛化能力。通过系统性消融实验，展示了偏见相关计算的高度局部化特性。

Result: 偏见相关计算集中在少数层内；这些组成部分随微调设置（包括与偏见无关的设置）而变化；去除这些组件不仅减少了偏见输出，还影响其他NLP任务的表现，因为这些任务共享重要组件。

Conclusion: 偏见在大型语言模型中的表示是高度局部化的，但其组成成分会因微调而改变。去除偏见相关组件可能对其他NLP任务产生副作用，表明需要更精细的方法来处理偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG, a new framework, enhances LLM performance in ODQA tasks by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality and ensuring sufficient evidence. It outperforms existing methods and is cost-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compression methods in RAG do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, limiting the performance in LLM-based RAG.

Method: ECoRAG compresses retrieved documents based on evidentiality to ensure answer generation is supported by correct evidence. It also checks if the compressed content provides sufficient evidence and retrieves more if necessary.

Result: Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. It is also highly cost-efficient, reducing latency and minimizing token usage.

Conclusion: ECoRAG framework enhances LLM performance in ODQA tasks while being cost-efficient.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large-scale neural language models can perform in-context counterfactual reasoning, such as predicting consequences of changes under hypothetical scenarios, without parameter update. This study focuses on a synthetic linear regression task with noise abduction, showing that self-attention, model depth, and pre-training data diversity drive performance in Transformers, with potential implications for counterfactual story generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ability of large-scale neural language models to perform in-context counterfactual reasoning, which involves predicting consequences of changes under hypothetical scenarios without parameter updates.

Method: The study investigates a controlled synthetic setup involving a linear regression task requiring noise abduction. The models infer and copy contextual noise from factual observations to make accurate predictions.

Result: Language models demonstrate capability in counterfactual reasoning within this controlled setup. Self-attention, model depth, and data diversity in pre-training significantly influence performance in Transformers. Additionally, Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, suggesting potential for counterfactual story generation.

Conclusion: Large-scale neural language models are capable of in-context counterfactual reasoning, driven by self-attention mechanisms, model depth, and diverse pre-training data. These findings extend beyond regression tasks and indicate potential applications in areas like counterfactual story generation.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GEM的自监督方法，使大型解码器语言模型能够生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保持原有的文本生成和推理能力。实验表明，该方法在MTEB上显著提升性能，对MMLU影响较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多应用（如检索增强生成）依赖单独的嵌入模型生成文本嵌入，这可能导致系统复杂化及查询理解不一致的问题。

Method: 通过在文本中插入特殊标记，并操作注意力掩码生成文本摘要嵌入。此方法可轻松融入现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在1B到8B参数的两个流行LLM家族上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了MTEB基准测试的性能，而对MMLU的影响很小。

Conclusion: GEM方法可以赋予LLM最先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持其原始的NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中，大型语言模型（LLMs）常面临知识冲突问题，即检索到的外部知识与模型内部的知识相矛盾。为解决这一问题，本文提出了Micro-Act框架，通过分层动作空间自动感知上下文复杂性，并将每个知识源分解为一系列精细比较，从而有效缓解冲突。实验表明，Micro-Act在五个基准数据集上显著提高了问答准确率，并且在非冲突问题上也表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的解决知识冲突的方法通常通过直接对比两种知识来源，但这种方法容易使LLMs被冗长或无关的上下文淹没，从而难以有效识别和缓解不一致性。

Method: 提出了一种名为Micro-Act的框架，该框架具有分层动作空间，能够自动感知上下文复杂性，并将每个知识源分解为一系列精细比较，这些比较以可操作步骤的形式呈现，有助于超越表面的上下文进行推理。

Result: 通过在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验，Micro-Act在所有5个数据集和3种冲突类型中均显著提高了问答准确率，特别是在时间和语义类型的冲突中，所有基线方法都显著失败。此外，Micro-Act在非冲突问题上也表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: Micro-Act框架不仅有效缓解了知识冲突问题，而且在非冲突问题上也表现出色，显示出其在实际RAG应用中的实用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic workflows with multiple AI agents often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal performance due to poorly designed prompts.

Method: ProRefine leverages textual feedback from large language models to dynamically refine prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional training or ground truth labels.

Result: ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: ProRefine not only boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of larger ones, promoting efficient and scalable AI deployment.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTC-CLIP, a model for Hierarchical Text Classification that integrates contrastive learning and path-guided hierarchy to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical Text Classification is crucial in various domains like E-commerce, customer care and medicine industry. Existing models either encode label hierarchy separately or guide the text encoder with the label hierarchy structure, both capturing different characteristics of label hierarchy and being complementary to each other.

Method: The proposed method, HTC-CLIP, learns hierarchy-aware text representation and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive learning. It learns two different sets of class probabilities distributions during training and uses the pooled output during inference.

Result: HTC-CLIP effectively combines the strengths of previous approaches, leading to improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score over existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The integration of contrastive learning and path-guided hierarchy in HTC-CLIP leads to better hierarchical text classification results, showing significant improvements over current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An embedder-cum-classifier model architecture is proposed to extend domain-specific models to other domains with few labeled samples, improving accuracy in intent detection for Customer Care datasets in Canada and Mexico by 20-23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer care is crucial in e-commerce, requiring significant resources across various geographies, channels, and languages. While SOTA pre-trained models perform well, they need sufficient domain-specific data which is often unavailable cross-domain.

Method: Propose an embedder-cum-classifier model using supervised fine-tuning with isotropic regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and multilingual knowledge distillation to generalize it across domains.

Result: Experiments show a 20-23% increase in accuracy compared to existing SOTA pre-trained models for few-shot intent detection in Customer Care datasets from Canada and Mexico.

Conclusion: The proposed model architecture effectively extends domain-specific models to new domains with limited labeled data, significantly enhancing intent detection accuracy.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

*Taha Entesari,Arman Hatami,Rinat Khaziev,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahyar Fazlyab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new method for Large Language Models (LLMs) unlearning by formulating it as a constrained optimization problem, which effectively removes targeted information while preserving downstream utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods face issues such as unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained data when trying to forget sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.

Method: The paper proposes to formulate LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem. Forgetting is enforced via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that drives the output distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set.

Result: Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across diverse LLM architectures show that the proposed approach consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines in removing targeted information while preserving downstream utility.

Conclusion: The new formulation of LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem provides a more efficient and robust solution compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes REWIRE, a method to recycle and enrich low-quality documents for training large language models, improving performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of high-quality pre-training data and the 'data wall' issue as compute supply grows faster than natural data sources.

Method: REWIRE transforms discarded low-quality documents into useful synthetic data by guided rewriting, increasing the representation of such data in the final pre-training set.

Result: Experiments show improvements of 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points at different scales compared to using only filtered web data; also outperforms other synthetic data generation methods.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts via REWIRE is a simple and effective approach to scale pre-training data for large language models.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制生成文本长度的方法通常需要复杂的模型更改，这限制了其与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 开发一种简单的方法，通过在交叉熵损失计算中增加正确预测EOS（句子结束）标记的重要性来控制自动文本摘要的长度。

Result: 该方法可以控制生成长度，通常不会影响摘要的质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法对于编码器-解码器和现代GPT风格的大型语言模型都有效，并且与架构和解码算法无关，是其他推理时技术的正交补充。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究人员收集并发布了Common Pile v0.1，一个8TB的开源文本数据集，用于训练大型语言模型（LLMs），以解决知识产权和伦理问题。基于此数据集，他们训练了两个70亿参数的LLM模型Comma v0.1-1T和Comma v0.1-2T，其性能与使用未授权文本训练的类似计算预算的模型相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常在大量未经授权的文本上进行训练，这引发了可能侵犯知识产权和道德方面的担忧。为了应对这些问题，需要使用公开授权的文本进行训练，但以前的努力未能产生足够大或高质量的数据集来生成高性能的LLM。

Method: 研究人员收集、策划并发布了Common Pile v0.1，这是一个包含8TB公开授权文本的数据集，旨在用于LLM预训练。该数据集内容来自30个来源，涵盖研究论文、代码、书籍、百科全书、教育材料、音频转录等多个领域。然后，他们在Common Pile的文本上训练了两个70亿参数的LLM模型：Comma v0.1-1T和Comma v0.1-2T，分别基于1万亿和2万亿令牌进行训练。

Result: Comma v0.1-1T和Comma v0.1-2T两个模型在相似计算预算下，达到了与使用未经授权文本训练的LLM（如Llama 1和2 7B）相当的竞争力。此外，研究人员还发布了创建Common Pile v0.1的代码、训练混合物以及Comma v0.1模型的检查点。

Conclusion: 通过使用公开授权的文本集合（如Common Pile v0.1）训练LLM，可以有效缓解知识产权和伦理问题，并生成具有竞争力的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

TL;DR: Search-augmented language models are improved by web search but hard to analyze due to limited datasets. This study introduces Search Arena, a large dataset of user interactions with these models, revealing insights about user preferences and system performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of analyzing search-augmented language models due to the limitations of existing datasets which are small in scale and narrow in scope.

Method: Introduced Search Arena, a large-scale, crowd-sourced dataset of over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs, including around 12,000 human preference votes. Conducted analysis on user preferences and performed cross-arena analyses.

Result: User preferences are influenced by number of citations and cited sources; community-driven platforms are preferred over static encyclopedic sources. Web search improves performance even in non-search settings, but relying solely on model's parametric knowledge affects quality in search settings.

Conclusion: The open-sourced Search Arena dataset provides valuable insights and supports future research on search-augmented language models.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

### [254] [Trustworthiness Preservation by Copies of Machine Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05203)
*Leonardo Ceragioli,Giuseppe Primiero*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a calculus to verify probabilistic complex queries over data and defines four notions of trustworthiness for copies of systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to verify that trustworthiness is preserved in copied systems in the context of responsible AI.

Method: A calculus is introduced to model and verify probabilistic complex queries over data. Four distinct notions of trustworthiness are defined and their relations are studied.

Result: The study provides a computational tool to check the trustworthiness of complex systems copied from an original known system.

Conclusion: This work offers a method to ensure the trustworthiness of copied systems, contributing to responsible AI.

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

TL;DR: hdl2v是一个将VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3编译为Verilog的大型数据集，通过它可提升LLM在Verilog生成任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于公开可用的Verilog代码数量远少于像Python这样的软件语言，这限制了LLM在硬件代码生成领域的能力。

Method: 创建了一个名为hdl2v的数据集，该数据集通过将三种其他硬件描述语言（VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3）翻译或编译成Verilog来增加人类编写的Verilog数据量。然后使用这个数据集对一个320亿参数的开源权重模型进行训练，并评估其在VerilogEvalV2上的表现。

Result: 使用hdl2v数据集，在不使用任何数据增强或从更大模型的知识蒸馏的情况下，使模型性能提升了23%（pass@10）。此外，hdl2v还能使基于数据增强的微调方法的性能提高63%。

Conclusion: hdl2v数据集展示了其在提升LLM Verilog生成能力方面的价值，并为进一步改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

TL;DR: Processor chip design faces challenges that Automated processor chip design, especially with AI and LLMs, can address. This paper introduces QiMeng, a system with three hierarchical layers including a domain-specific Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM) to automate hardware and software design for processor chips.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processor chip design is challenged by fabrication technology limits, increasing resource demands, and ecosystem diversity. The rise of AI and LLMs offers potential for fully automated chip design, but creating domain-specific LLMs for this purpose remains challenging.

Method: QiMeng consists of three hierarchical layers: bottom-layer includes a domain-specific Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM) addressing knowledge representation gap, data scarcity, correctness assurance, and solution space enormity; middle-layer develops Hardware and Software Design Agents using LPCM's capabilities; top-layer applies these components in various applications.

Result: Several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully applied, showing significant advantages and providing an efficient, fully automated solution for processor chip hardware/software design.

Conclusion: Future research will integrate all components of QiMeng and perform iterative design processes to establish a comprehensive system for fully automated processor chip design.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the potential of computational methods in utilizing unused data from rigorous and resource-intensive qualitative studies.

Method: General discussion on secondary analysis of qualitative data, proposal of a scheme for computationally intensive secondary analysis, and enumeration of challenges in data sharing and reuse.

Result: A scheme for computationally intensive secondary analysis is proposed, along with insights on innovative research designs and key challenges in data sharing and reuse.

Conclusion: Computational methods offer opportunities for secondary analysis of qualitative data, but challenges in data sharing and reuse need to be addressed.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: This paper uses the National Crime Victimization Survey from 1992 to 2022 and logistic regression models evaluated by F1-score to explore how socioeconomic factors affect crime victimization. The results show higher income and education lower violent crime odds, while certain demographics face higher risks. Geographic differences also exist in model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how socioeconomic factors (income, education, employment) and demographic factors (age, gender, race, marital status) shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs property).

Method: Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models evaluated by F1-score, 'Group A' models focus on socioeconomic drivers and 'Group B' models add demographic factors.

Result: Higher income and education decrease violent crime odds relative to property crime; men, younger individuals, and racial minorities face higher violent crime risks. Suburban models perform best, urban benefit from education and employment predictors, rural areas remain unpredictable.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for targeted interventions such as educational investments in metropolitan areas, economic support in rural communities, and demographic-aware prevention strategies.

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify geodesic curves that best capture the modes of variation in datasets of probability distributions.

Method: 1. For Gaussian distributions, computations are lifted to the space of invertible linear maps.
2. For absolutely continuous probability measures, a novel neural network approach is used to parameterize geodesics in Wasserstein space.

The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures

address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to

general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 研究了单智能体强化学习（RL）和联邦RL（FRL）问题，提出两种新算法Q-EarlySettled-LowCost和FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost，它们在最小化烧入成本、策略切换或通信成本方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界中，数据收集和策略部署对于单个智能体或多智能体来说成本高昂，因此需要减少烧入成本（达到接近最优后悔所需的样本量）以及策略切换或通信成本。

Method: 提出了两种新的无模型RL算法：Q-EarlySettled-LowCost和FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost。这些算法在有限时间范围内并行的马尔可夫决策过程中运行，并且首次同时实现了以下目标：接近最优的后悔值、低烧入成本（与状态数S和动作数A线性相关）、对数级的策略切换成本（针对单智能体RL）或通信成本（针对联邦RL）。

Result: 所提出的算法在烧入成本、策略切换或通信成本方面表现优异，并且提供了与差距相关的理论保证，改进或匹配了已知的最佳差距相关界限。

Conclusion: 新提出的算法在性能和成本控制上都优于现有方法，为单智能体RL和联邦RL提供了更高效的选择。

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

*Sébastien Da Veiga*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper proposes a generalization of Gaussian Process (GP) regression based on distributional encoding (DE) for handling categorical input variables, leading to state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve GP regression when dealing with categorical input variables, as current methods struggle to be both predictive and computationally efficient in this context.

Method: The method involves replacing original categorical values with the mean of the target variable for that category using a technique called distributional encoding (DE). This encoding uses all samples of the target variable for a category. The authors leverage recent results on characteristic kernels for probability distributions, such as maximum mean discrepancy and Wasserstein distance, to handle DE within GPs. Extensions for classification, multi-task learning, and incorporating auxiliary information are also discussed.

Result: The proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art predictive performance on various synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Distributional encoding (DE) provides an effective solution for GP regression with categorical variables, complementing recent advances in Bayesian optimization over discrete and mixed spaces.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

Motivation: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous interventions can be challenging.

Method: The study presents an identifiability result for inferring joint interventional effects without access to joint interventional data, focusing on a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms. A practical estimator is proposed which decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded contributions for each intervention variable.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to models trained directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational estimator.

Conclusion: Joint interventional effects can be learned using only observational data and single-variable interventions for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，从观测数据中推断因果关系受到广泛关注，但大多数方法仅限于标量随机变量。许多领域中的因果单位是变量组而非单一测量值，因此需要一种适用于随机向量的因果推断方法。

Method: 扩展非线性加性噪声模型以处理随机向量，采用两步法：1）推断随机向量间的因果顺序；2）通过模型选择确定与该顺序一致的最佳因果图。同时引入了针对这两步的有效新解决方案。

Result: 在模拟中表现出强大的性能，并成功应用于具有部分因果顺序知识的真实装配线数据。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可以有效推断随机向量间的因果关系，并适用于实际场景如装配线数据分析。

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Motivation: 研究者关注在实验设计中是否可以忽略自适应试验选项而选择非自适应试验，特别是在最佳臂识别问题的背景下。

Method: 通过引入效率指数的概念，分析了自适应设计（如分批臂消除设计）与非自适应完全随机化试验的统计效率，并提供充分条件说明自适应设计能普遍且严格地优于非自适应设计。

Result: 当存在至少三个处理臂时，简单的自适应设计在统计效率上严格优于非自适应完全随机化试验，尤其是在大样本情况下。

Conclusion: 在最佳臂识别问题中，自适应设计比非自适应试验更有效率，解决了Qin [2022]提出的第二个开放问题。

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

TL;DR: The paper explores the challenges brought by AI systems to public sector oversight mechanisms and proposes solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the intensified challenges posed by agentic AI systems to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms, which are not suitable for continuous and integrated supervision.

Method: The method used in this paper is a mixed-methods approach including literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles.

Result: The result shows that agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proposing approaches that adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight compatible with public sector constraints.

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

TL;DR: The paper argues that outputs from large AI models shouldn't be protected by the First Amendment because these models lack intentionality, thus their outputs don't constitute speech in a legal sense. Also, giving First Amendment rights to AI would not promote free speech purposes and could be harmful to society.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment protections to outputs from large generative AI models.

Method: Analyzing the concept of speech in legal context and the purposes of free speech, and evaluating the potential societal impacts of granting First Amendment rights to AI models.

Result: Outputs from AI models are not considered as 'speech' under established legal precedent due to lack of intentionality. Granting First Amendment protections to AI models would hinder government regulation and potentially cause misinformation spread.

Conclusion: Granting First Amendment protections to AI model outputs is not justified and could be detrimental to society.

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

Result: BridgeNet achieves significantly lower error metrics, faster convergence, and robust stability in high-dimensional settings compared to conventional PINN approaches.

Conclusion: This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, providing a scalable and accurate solution methodology for various fields.

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to

*Enshen Zhou,Jingkun An,Cheng Chi,Yi Han,Shanyu Rong,Chi Zhang,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Tiejun Huang,Lu Sheng,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboRefer is a 3D-aware VLM that improves spatial understanding and reasoning through SFT and RFT training, outperforming other baselines in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches with pretrained vision language models (VLMs) struggle to accurately understand complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about locations for interaction.

Method: Proposed RoboRefer integrates a dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for precise spatial understanding and advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). A large-scale dataset RefSpatial and a benchmark RefSpatial-Bench are introduced to support the training.

Result: SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer surpasses all other baselines by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench.

Conclusion: RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots in cluttered real-world scenes.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

*Haokun Liu,Zhaoqi Ma,Yunong Li,Junichiro Sugihara,Yicheng Chen,Jinjie Li,Moju Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical framework combining LLM and VLM is proposed for heterogeneous multi-robot systems, demonstrating adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems have great potential in complex tasks but traditional approaches relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic environments.

Method: The method involves a hierarchical framework integrating a prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic map construction while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D spatial information from aerial images to support local planning.

Result: Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: This work presents the first demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Conclusion: SGN-CIRL successfully enhances robot navigation capabilities via the combination of 3D scene graphs and reinforcement learning techniques.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the

the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also
employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the
agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the
training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more
advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim

Motivation: To address the disturbances caused by gas dynamics and environmental factors in olfactory navigation tasks, thereby improving the precision of OIO for specific applications like robotic surgery and touchless security screening.

Method: Defining a generalized calibration process for robots performing OIO, focusing on achieving centimeter-level accuracy in localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform. This method is demonstrated on a real robotic arm.

Result: The calibration process significantly improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing OIO accuracy.

Conclusion: A successful calibration process for OIO has been developed, which can generalize to several olfaction sensor types and improve the accuracy of odor source localization, opening up possibilities for use in robotic surgery and security screening.

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

It maintains reasonable accuracy and has implications in analytical chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of extended measurement durations in room-temperature ionic liquids due to high viscosity and slow mass transport, which limits the efficiency of chronoamperometric techniques.

Method: A novel mathematical regression approach is applied to the initial transient current response using an inference algorithm to predict steady-state electrochemical parameters.

Conclusion: This technique allows for faster multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements, which could significantly enhance rapid olfactory and electrochemical analysis in fields such as analytical chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science.

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster

### [277] [VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614)
*Zhanhui Zhou,Lingjie Chen,Chao Yang,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在视觉-语言模型（VLMs）中，存在一种通过数据调节来降低风险的方法，但这种方法可能被绕过。本文研究了VLMs的一种核心能力——视觉拼接，它允许模型将分散在多个训练样本中的视觉信息整合起来。作者展示了常见开源VLMs的视觉拼接能力，并模拟了对抗性数据投毒场景，揭示了这种能力带来的严重安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管可以通过移除危险样本来降低视觉-语言模型的风险，但有害图像可以被分割成无害的小块，散布在许多训练样本中，使数据调节失效。模型可能会在训练过程中学习到如何将这些碎片组合起来，在推理时生成有害响应。

Method: 1. 定义了视觉拼接的概念：将分布在多个具有相同文本描述的训练样本中的视觉信息整合起来。
2. 在三个数据集上展示常见开源VLMs的视觉拼接能力，通过将每个(image, ID)对分成(patch, ID)对进行微调，验证模型可以从完整图像或文本引用中正确说出ID。
3. 模拟对抗性数据投毒场景，使用危险图像的片段并将ID替换为诸如“safe”或“unsafe”的文本描述，演示有害内容如何通过视觉拼接规避调节并重建。

Result: 实验结果表明，经过微调的模型能够从完整图像或文本引用中正确识别出合成ID，证明了VLMs具备视觉拼接能力。此外，在对抗性数据投毒场景下，模型能够通过视觉拼接生成有害内容，验证了该方法的有效性和潜在风险。

Conclusion: 视觉拼接是VLMs中一个重要的能力，但也带来了显著的安全风险。需要进一步研究以防止有害内容通过视觉拼接规避数据调节，确保VLMs的安全性。

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove
dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be
easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking
patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece
these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at
inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained
on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs
may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe."
We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual
stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across
multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our
work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source
VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID:
we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch},
\texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that
tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference.
Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned
above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text
descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can
evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual
stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at

Motivation: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.

Method: RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework. In the reasoning stage, it employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets. In segmentation stage, it refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM).

Result: RSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning segmentation and is an effective and scalable framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual

TL;DR: 为了弥补当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多图像推理能力评估方面的不足，研究者们提出了多模态多图像推理基准（MMRB），该基准涵盖了92个子任务，并通过大量基线实验揭示了开源MLLMs与商业MLLMs之间的显著差距，特别是在多图像推理和奖励排名任务上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM基准测试要么专注于单图像视觉推理，要么仅以最终答案评估多图像理解任务，未能充分探索MLLMs在多图像输入上的推理能力。

Method: 引入了Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)，这是首个用于评估跨多图像结构化视觉推理的基准，包含92个子任务，涵盖空间、时间和语义推理；采用由GPT-4o生成并经人类专家优化的多解决方案、CoT风格注释；设计了一个衍生子集用于评估多图像场景中的多模态奖励模型；提出了一种使用开源LLMs的句子级匹配框架以支持快速且可扩展的评估。

Result: 对40个MLLMs进行的广泛基线实验表明，开源MLLMs在多图像推理任务上的表现明显落后于商业MLLMs；当前的多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Conclusion: MMRB填补了多图像推理评估领域的空白，揭示了现有开源MLLMs及奖励模型在多图像处理方面的能力局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for visual question answering in chest radiology that reflects core radiological reasoning skills and to evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal models against it.

Method: Development of the ReXVQA benchmark containing 696,000 questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays, evaluation of eight advanced models including MedGemma, and conducting a human reader study comparing AI performance to clinical expertise.

Result: MedGemma achieved the highest accuracy (83.24%) among evaluated models and surpassed human readers' accuracy (best at 77.27%) in interpreting chest X-rays.

Conclusion: ReXVQA sets a new standard for evaluating radiological AI systems, demonstrating AI's potential to exceed expert human performance and paving the way for next-generation AI capable of advanced clinical reasoning.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2\% and RSLE average precision of 25\%. Our research demonstrates the
critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection
performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows that activation maximization can be applied to DNN-based encoding models to predict and modulate brain responses across the human visual system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks develop feature representations similar to the human visual system, but offer limited insight into specific features driving brain responses.

Method: Using pretrained Inception V3 network activations, linear regression predicts fMRI responses. Activation maximization generates images optimized for predicted responses in cortical voxels and ROIs.

Result: Generated images reliably drive activity in targeted brain regions across low- and high-level visual areas and subjects.

Conclusion: Activation maximization can successfully be applied to DNN-based encoding models, enabling flexible characterization and modulation of responses in the human visual system.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

*Hermann Kumbong,Xian Liu,Tsung-Yi Lin,Ming-Yu Liu,Xihui Liu,Ziwei Liu,Daniel Y. Fu,Christopher Ré,David W. Romero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HMAR is a new image generation algorithm that improves upon VAR by using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR has shown promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models, but it suffers from reduced image quality, superlinear sequence lengths, and retraining requirements for changing the sampling schedule.

Method: HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process and uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of tokens in each step. It also develops efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR matches or outperforms parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. It achieves faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint.

Conclusion: HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

### [284] [Photoreal Scene Reconstruction from an Egocentric Device](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04444)
*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of egocentric devices for photorealistic scene reconstruction in high dynamic range, presenting two key findings: the importance of visual-inertial bundle adjustment for rolling-shutter RGB cameras and a physical image formation model integrated into Gaussian Splatting. These methods provide consistent visual enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges in using egocentric devices for photorealistic scene reconstruction, particularly focusing on improving the accuracy of reconstruction by considering crucial details often neglected in existing methodologies.

Method: The study presents two methods: 1) Using visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate precise timestamps and movement of rolling-shutter RGB cameras, and 2) Incorporating a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting to address sensor characteristics.

Result: The proposed methods lead to a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through the proposed image formation model.

Conclusion: The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods across diverse lighting conditions, leading to improved photorealistic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

*Takayuki Komatsu,Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Kayato Nishitsunoi,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method that combines feature extraction and object segmentation with group decomposition theory to create meaningful representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision, validated on a practical dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Representation learning aims to acquire meaningful representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision. However, conventional methods often assume disentangled independent feature axes as good representations which cannot account for conditional independence.

Method: The authors propose a new method using group decomposition in Galois algebra theory combined with feature extraction and object segmentation. They replace pixel translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation.

Result: The proposed method was validated on a practical dataset containing both real-world objects and background, demonstrating its potential for real-world application.

Conclusion: This study provides a promising approach to understanding human development of object recognition in the real world by combining feature extraction, object segmentation, and group decomposition theory.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

*Jing-En Huang,I-Sheng Fang,Tzuhsuan Huang,Chih-Yu Wang,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Gen-n-Val的新框架，用于生成高质量的单对象掩码和多样化背景，解决了合成数据生成中的问题。该框架包含两个代理：LD提示代理和数据验证代理，并通过TextGrad优化系统提示，使用图像协调来组合多个实例。与现有方法相比，Gen-n-Val显著减少了无效合成数据的比例，提高了COCO实例分割和开放词汇对象检测基准上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉大型语言模型（VLLMs）在各种任务中表现出色，但计算机视觉任务如目标检测和实例分割仍然面临数据稀缺和标签噪声的问题。当前的合成数据生成方法存在多对象掩码、不准确的分割和错误的类别标签等问题，限制了其有效性。

Method: Gen-n-Val框架结合了层扩散（LD）、LLMs和VLLMs。具体来说，它包括两个代理：(1) LD提示代理，一个LLM，用于优化LD生成高质量前景实例图像和分割掩码的提示。(2) 数据验证代理，一个VLLM，用于过滤掉低质量的合成实例图像。系统提示通过TextGrad进行优化，同时使用图像协调技术将多个实例组合到场景中。

Result: 与最先进的合成数据方法（如MosaicFusion）相比，Gen-n-Val将无效合成数据的比例从50%降低到7%，并在COCO实例分割上提升了1%的mAP（针对稀有类别）。此外，在开放词汇对象检测基准上，Gen-n-Val比YOLO-Worldv2-M提高了7.1%的mAP。总体而言，Gen-n-Val改善了YOLOv9和YOLO11系列模型在实例分割和对象检测中的性能。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够生成高质量的单对象掩码和多样化背景，从而显著减少无效合成数据并提高计算机视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 尽管有新兴的努力来提高视觉-语言模型(VLMs)的安全性，但目前的方法仍存在两个主要缺陷。1）现有的安全调整数据集和基准仅部分考虑了图像-文本交互如何产生有害内容，常常忽略了看似无害的对中可能出现的情境不安全结果。这种狭窄的覆盖范围使VLMs在未见配置中容易受到越狱攻击。2）以前的方法主要依赖于以数据为中心的调整，缺乏架构创新以内在地加强安全性。为了解决这些差距，我们引入了一个全面的安全数据集和基准HoliSafe，涵盖了所有五种安全/不安全的图像-文本组合，为训练和评估提供了更强大的基础。我们还提出了SafeLLaVA，一种新型的VLM，它增加了一个可学习的安全元标记和一个专门的安全头。元标记在训练过程中编码有害的视觉线索，内在地引导语言模型走向更安全的响应，而安全头则提供与拒绝理由一致的可解释有害分类。实验表明，基于HoliSafe训练的SafeLLaVA在多个VLM基准上实现了最先进的安全性能。此外，HoliSafe基准本身揭示了现有模型中的关键漏洞。我们希望HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA能够激发对强大且可解释的VLM安全性的进一步研究，扩展未来的多模态对齐方向。

Motivation: 当前VLMs的安全方法存在局限性：1）未能充分考虑图像-文本交互可能产生的有害内容；2）过于依赖数据驱动的方法，缺乏架构上的创新来内在提升安全性。因此需要更全面的数据集和模型架构来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的数据集和基准HoliSafe，涵盖所有五种安全/不安全的图像-文本组合。同时提出了一种新型VLM SafeLLaVA，包含可学习的安全元标记和专门的安全头，用于编码有害视觉线索并引导语言模型生成更安全的响应。

Conclusion: HoliSafe和SafeLLaVA将推动VLM安全性领域的进一步研究，促进更强大和可解释的多模态对齐发展。

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

TL;DR: Language models can be enhanced with multimodal capabilities through fine-tuning on visual input embeddings, where image concepts in LlaVA-Next are represented via linearly decodable features in the residual stream.

Motivation: To understand how multimodal models represent images in their hidden activations after being equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning on visual input embeddings.

Method: Exploring representations of image concepts within LlaVA-Next by identifying linearly decodable features in the residual stream and confirming their causality through targeted edits on model output. Training multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to create an interpretable dictionary of text and image features.

Result: A diverse set of ImageNet classes are represented via linearly decodable features in the residual stream. Model representations across modalities are quite disjoint but become increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Conclusion: Multimodal models like LlaVA-Next effectively represent image concepts through linearly decodable features which are causal. The use of Sparse Autoencoders enhances interpretability of these features.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP)方法，通过选择关键的认知样本和引入困难样本替换模块，显著减少训练数据量和计算成本，同时在多模态推理任务上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂推理任务中取得了显著进展，但通常认为需要大量训练数据来提升多模态推理能力，这导致了数据冗余和高昂的计算成本。因此，研究者试图探讨是否可以通过更小的、高价值的数据集实现与完整数据集相当或更好的多模态推理效果。

Method: 研究者提出了一种新的数据选择范式——推理激活潜力（RAP），用于识别认知样本。该方法包含两个互补的估计器：1）因果差异估计器（CDE），基于潜在结果模型原则，通过比较多模态输入和纯文本输入的输出，消除过度依赖语言先验的样本；2）注意力置信估计器（ACE），利用token级别的自注意力机制，去除中间推理阶段被过度强调的无关token所主导的样本。此外，还引入了一个难度感知替换模块（DRM），用认知挑战性实例替代简单实例，确保推理的复杂性和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，在仅使用9.3%训练数据的情况下，RAP方法在六个数据集上的一致表现优于完整数据集的方法，并且计算成本降低了超过43%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心选择认知样本和引入难度感知替换模块，可以在大幅减少训练数据和计算成本的同时，提高多模态推理的性能。这为未来高效训练多模态大语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for

annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation

Result: 所提出的IQA架构能够抵御对抗性攻击，而无需进行对抗性训练或对原始模型进行重大修改。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，通过设计可以实现鲁棒性，而不仅仅是依赖数据优化，提示了在构建感知模型时应转变视角，更多地考虑工程设计上的改进。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

### [294] [Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling: A Multi-Factor Adaptive Perturbation Budget for Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04263)
*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES), a novel framework for adversarial training that adaptively adjusts the perturbation budget per instance and iteration, integrating distance to decision boundary, prediction confidence, and model uncertainty. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show improvements in both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial training is effective but limited by reliance on fixed perturbation budgets, which don't account for instance-specific robustness characteristics. Existing adaptive methods rely on heuristic or static approximations.

Method: DES integrates three factors: distance to decision boundary via gradient-based proxies, prediction confidence from softmax entropy, and model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout, adjusting the perturbation budget dynamically.

Result: DES consistently improves adversarial robustness and standard accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods.

Conclusion: DES provides a new approach for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training with theoretical insights into stability and convergence.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

### [295] [Rectified Point Flow: Generic Point Cloud Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05282)
*Tao Sun,Liyuan Zhu,Shengyu Huang,Shuran Song,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents Rectified Point Flow, a unified method for point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly via a conditional generative approach. It learns continuous point-wise velocity fields for transporting points to target positions, intrinsically learning assembly symmetries without symmetry labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods regress part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, which may not be efficient or accurate enough. The authors aim to develop a more intrinsic and effective way to learn assembly symmetries without the need for symmetry labels.

Method: They introduce a unified parameterization called Rectified Point Flow that formulates pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, it learns a continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their target positions. This method intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels and uses a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points.

Result: This method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise registration and shape assembly.

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow provides an effective unified formulation enabling joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of

### [296] [Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341)
*Xingjian Ran,Yixuan Li,Linning Xu,Mulin Yu,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DirectLayout is a framework that generates 3D layouts from text descriptions, utilizing spatial reasoning of large language models and enhancing generalization through Chain-of-Thought Activation and CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for layout generation in 3D indoor scene synthesis either overfit to limited datasets or rely on predefined constraints, failing to produce scenes that are open-vocabulary and align with user instructions.

Method: The DirectLayout framework decomposes the generation process into three stages: creating a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. It uses Chain-of-Thought Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset for explicit spatial reasoning and introduces CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to improve generalization and spatial planning. During inference, Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment is used to address asset-layout mismatches.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DirectLayout achieves high semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility in generating 3D layouts from text descriptions.

Conclusion: DirectLayout offers a novel approach to 3D layout generation by leveraging the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models and providing a more flexible and generalized solution compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

*Shengcao Cao,Zijun Wei,Jason Kuen,Kangning Liu,Lingzhi Zhang,Jiuxiang Gu,HyunJoon Jung,Liang-Yan Gui,Yu-Xiong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Recent image segmentation models lack comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision, reducing their effectiveness in user-friendly interactions. To address this, the paper introduces a novel task called omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) and proposes a framework named 'Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group' (RAS). RAS augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions through a mask-centric large multimodal model. Datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ are created for training and benchmarking ORES models. Extensive evaluations show superior performance of RAS on ORES, RES, and GRES tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image segmentation models cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries that involve both language and vision, limiting their effectiveness in applications requiring user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts.

Method: The authors propose a novel framework called 'Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group' (RAS), which enhances segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model. They also introduce datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ for training and benchmarking ORES models.

Result: Through extensive evaluation, RAS demonstrates superior performance on the new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed RAS framework effectively addresses the challenge of omnimodal referring expression segmentation, providing a significant advancement in models capable of handling complex multimodal interactions.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LotusFilter, a post-processing module for diversifying ANNS results by precomputing a cutoff table to delete redundant vectors. It operates fast in real-world RAG applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of overly similar results in Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) and provide diverse yet relevant search results.

Method: Precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors close to each other and use it during filtering to greedily delete redundant vectors from candidates.

Result: Demonstrated fast operation speed of 0.02 [ms/query] in settings resembling real-world RAG applications using features like OpenAI embeddings.

Conclusion: LotusFilter effectively diversifies ANNS results while maintaining high efficiency.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

*Svetlana Pavlitska,Jamie Robb,Nikolai Polley,Melih Yazgan,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper shows how CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches, proposes a threat model and training strategy, and demonstrates realistic targeted attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traffic light detectors in autonomous vehicles have not been extensively studied in terms of adversarial attacks. This work aims to explore the vulnerability of these detectors to printed patch attacks.

Method: The authors propose a threat model where each traffic light instance is attacked by placing a patch underneath it. They also describe a training strategy for creating universal adversarial patches that can perform label-flipping and pictogram classification attacks.

Result: Experiments demonstrated successful red-to-green label-flipping attacks and pictogram classification attacks. Real-world evaluations confirmed the effectiveness of the attacks using printed patches on mobile and stationary traffic lights.

Conclusion: The study concludes that traffic light detection systems are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, highlighting the need for more robust detection algorithms.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

*Yuxin Wen,Yangsibo Huang,Tom Goldstein,Ravi Kumar,Badih Ghazi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores cross-modality memorization in vision-language models, revealing a gap in transferring factual knowledge between modalities and proposing a baseline solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unique characteristics of cross-modality memorization in unified multimodal models, which is crucial for both unintentional memorization concerns and effective knowledge acquisition.

Method: Introduced a synthetic persona dataset for controlled experiments. Quantified factual knowledge memorization and cross-modal transferability by training on one modality and evaluating on another.

Result: Facts learned in one modality can transfer to another, but there's a significant gap in recalling information across source and target modalities, observed across various scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposed a baseline method to address the cross-modal transferability gap and hopes to inspire future research in robust multimodal learning techniques.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

*Lijie Hu,Songning Lai,Yuan Hua,Shu Yang,Jingfeng Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) and Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) to bridge the utility gap between original models and concept-based models, ensuring model faithfulness through Denoised Diffusion Smoothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) in explainable AI solely rely on concept features for predictions, neglecting intrinsic feature embeddings within medical images. This creates a utility gap and affects model performance and stability in the medical field.

Method: The authors propose VCT and SVCT. VCT addresses the utility gap by incorporating both conceptual and image features. SVCT further ensures model faithfulness using Denoised Diffusion Smoothing, built on the backbone of vision transformer (ViT).

Result: Experiments on four medical datasets show that VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy and interpretability compared to baselines. SVCT also provides stable explanations even under perturbations.

Conclusion: VCT and SVCT successfully address the limitations of existing CBMs by enhancing decision-making with both concept and image features and ensuring faithfulness, making them suitable for medical applications.

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了BEAR（BGP事件分析与报告），这是一个利用大型语言模型自动生成BGP异常事件详细报告的新框架。该框架通过将表格数据转换为文本叙述，提高了可解释性和分析准确性，并且在真实和合成数据集上的评估显示其准确率达到100%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于规则和机器学习的方法虽然可以检测到BGP异常，但需要具有深入BGP知识的专家来解释事件并提出补救措施。因此，研究者们希望开发一个自动化系统，能够生成易于理解的报告，帮助网络管理员更好地理解和处理BGP异常。

Method: BEAR采用多步推理过程，将表格形式的BGP数据转化为详细的文本叙述，从而提高了解释性和分析精度。同时，为了应对公开记录的BGP异常数据有限的问题，研究者还提出了一个由大型语言模型驱动的合成数据生成框架。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的评估表明，BEAR实现了100%的准确率，优于Chain-of-Thought和情境学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作开创了一种自动解释BGP异常事件的方法，为网络管理提供了宝贵的运营见解。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

TL;DR: WiFi 7的多链路操作（MLO）虽提升了网络性能，但密集网络环境下的动态信道分配仍具挑战。本文将此问题建模为组合优化问题，并在多臂老虎机框架下提出BAI-MCTS算法及改进版LLM-BAI-MCTS算法。实验表明，新算法较现有方法收敛速度更快，特别是在密集网络中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WiFi 7的MLO功能虽然显著改善了网络吞吐量和延迟，但在密集网络环境中动态信道分配仍面临挑战。当前研究主要集中在静态网络配置的性能分析和吞吐量优化上，而对动态信道分配的研究较少。

Method: 本文将动态信道分配问题建模为组合优化问题，并利用多臂老虎机框架进行在线学习。提出了BAI-MCTS算法，并进行了严格的理论分析，提供了样本复杂度和错误概率的上限。此外，还提出了LLM-BAI-MCTS算法，通过整合大语言模型提高泛化能力和减少样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 所提出的BAI-MCTS和LLM-BAI-MCTS算法能够有效解决WiFi 7网络中MLO能力下的动态信道分配问题，在减少样本复杂度和提高收敛速度方面表现出色。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

TL;DR: Data analytics is crucial for MNOs to deliver more value. NWDAF introduced by 3GPP since Release 15 provides insights and predictions. Academic research has been limited, so this study identifies trends and gaps in over 70 articles, proposing two novel use cases for NWDAF adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MNOs underutilize data compared to OTT players. To overcome commoditization of connectivity and deliver greater customer value, there's a need to explore the potential of NWDAF for new service opportunities, operational efficiency, and risk mitigation.

Method: Analyzed more than 70 articles to identify trends and gaps in NWDAF research and proposed two novel use cases to promote NWDAF adoption and monetization potential.

Result: Identified current research trends and gaps, proposed two new use cases which can help in promoting the adoption of NWDAF and exploring its monetization potential.

Conclusion: NWDAF holds significant potential for MNOs to enhance service offerings, optimize operations, and mitigate risks. More comprehensive research and exploration beyond existing datasets and use cases are necessary.

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper proposes AI-augmented team optimization frameworks including a multi-armed bandit based team formation framework, tAIfa for personalized feedback, and PuppeteerLLM for simulating team dynamics to improve team satisfaction, engagement, and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing team optimization tools rely on static data inputs, narrow algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts. They fail to account for dynamic interplay of personalities, evolving goals, and changing preferences leading to dissatisfaction, reduced commitment, and suboptimal engagement.

Method: 1. A team formation framework using a multi-armed bandit algorithm to iteratively refine team composition. 2. tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant) utilizing large language models for immediate, personalized feedback. 3. PuppeteerLLM, an LLM-based simulation framework for modeling complex team dynamics.

Result: Enhanced team satisfaction through alignment between individual needs and team goals; improved cohesion and engagement with personalized feedback; better understanding of team dynamics via simulations.

Conclusion: AI-augmented team optimization frameworks can significantly enhance team satisfaction, engagement, and performance by addressing the limitations of existing tools.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an

Motivation: To provide a systematic review and taxonomy of LLM-based approaches in credit risk estimation, with a focus on interpretability.

Method: Selected 60 relevant papers published between 2020-2025 using the PRISMA research strategy to determine basic model architectures and examined data used for scenarios like credit default prediction and risk analysis.

Result: Organized literature under four main headings: model architectures, data types, explainability mechanisms, and application areas; highlighted future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit scoring systems.

Conclusion: Aims to serve as a reference paper for artificial intelligence and financial researchers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM), which have developed in recent years, enable
credit risk assessment through the analysis of financial texts such as analyst
reports and corporate disclosures. This paper presents the first systematic
review and taxonomy focusing on LLMbased approaches in credit risk estimation.
We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers
published between 2020-2025 with the PRISMA research strategy. And we examined
the data used for scenarios such as credit default prediction and risk
analysis. Since the main focus of the paper is interpretability, we classify
concepts such as explainability mechanisms, chain of thought prompts and
natural language justifications for LLM-based credit models. The taxonomy
organizes the literature under four main headings: model architectures, data
types, explainability mechanisms and application areas. Based on this analysis,
we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial
intelligence and financial researchers.
