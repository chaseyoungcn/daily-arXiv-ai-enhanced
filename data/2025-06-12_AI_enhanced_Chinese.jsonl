Existing\nmethods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,\noverlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically\ninconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme\nnamed Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates\ncontext-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,\nensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of\npre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an\nadversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing\nmodel misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This\ncomprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective\nadversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our\nexperimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate\nthe efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP\nsystems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances\nthe subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks. This study highlights the\ncritical role of context in adversarial attacks and lays the groundwork for\ncreating more robust NLP systems capable of withstanding sophisticated\nadversarial strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6270\u52a8\uff08DCP\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u5bf9\u6297\u6587\u672c\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684NLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u6587\u672c\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u4e0a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "DCP\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5728\u53e5\u5b50\u3001\u6bb5\u843d\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u522b\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDCP\u5728\u591a\u4e2aNLP\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684NLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u5fa1\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u6297\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684NLP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal\nprotection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains\nchallenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to\nproduce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy\nguarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during\ngeneration. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such\nmodels, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven\nutility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method\nfor deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.\n(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP\nmechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess\nits impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN\n- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD\nsignificantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the\ndatasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training\nstability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as\nGANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without\nguarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best\nnon-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.\nIn conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal\nguarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained\nuse cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u52a0\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86DP-SGD\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684DP\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u65e0DP\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86DP\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u654f\u611f\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6548\u7528\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30DP-SGD\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684DP\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6548\u7528\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001VAE\u548cGAN\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9690\u79c1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u7528-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "DP-SGD\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u5b9a\u6548\u7528\uff1b\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DP\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GAN\uff09\u4e2d\uff1b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u6548\u7528\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cGAN\u5728\u52a0\u5165DP-SGD\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76ee\u524d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces\nchallenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation\n(error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and\nLLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax,\nwhile ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's\ngradient optimization.

However, deploying these fixed models in\nreal-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess\nheterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to\ndeploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression\nmethods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve\nefficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing\nresource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable\nand Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by\nstitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires\naddressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal\nstitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,\nand choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these\nchallenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the\nstitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers\nfrom a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one.

However, several methods designed for\nfederated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication\nefficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among\nheterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of\nlocal adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large\nstacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or\nnecessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and\nperforming computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific\nlow-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning\nframework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring\nhigh communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full\nglobal weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient\ndecomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked\nlocal adapters separately.

However, the\nanthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding\nwhether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or\ninstructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of\ntechnology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical\nchallenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human\nintentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed\nfor non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic\nsystems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and\nsystem-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived\nenjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived\nusefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and\nlearning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,\nwe found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student\nperceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted\ntrusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral\nintention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived\nenjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we\npropose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots\n(human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of\ntrust.

We find that length\ngeneralization can be \\textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is,\ntraining a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to\ngeneralize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We\ndemonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic\ntasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze\nnavigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization\ncapabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nfoundation models are highly responsive to post-hoc calibration techniques in\nthe in-distribution setting, enabling practitioners to effectively mitigate\nunderconfidence bias. However, these methods become progressively less reliable\nunder severe distribution shifts and can occasionally produce counterproductive\nresults. Our findings highlight the complex, non-monotonic effects of\narchitectural and training innovations on calibration, challenging established\nnarratives of continuous improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reliable uncertainty calibration is crucial for deploying deep neural networks in high-stakes applications.

While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nmethods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing\napproaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in\ndomains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have\nintroduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these\nprivacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated\nfine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain\nlacking. In this work, we present \\textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic\nbenchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two\nmainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning\nstrategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four\ncross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,\ncovering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive\nexperiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM\narchitectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task\nfederated optimization.

We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward.

Computational approaches suggest that people\nconstruct simplified mental representations of their environment, balancing the\ncomplexity of a task representation with its utility. These models imply a\nnested optimisation in which planning shapes perception, and perception shapes\nplanning -- but the perceptual and attentional mechanisms governing how this\ninteraction unfolds remain unknown. Here, we harness virtual maze navigation to\ncharacterise how spatial attention controls which aspects of a task\nrepresentation enter subjective awareness and are available for planning. We\nfind that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for\nplanning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised)\ncontours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful\nmaze representations.

The\npowerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal\nspatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity\nreconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast\nweighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further\nenhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps.\nFurthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad\npotential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction\ntasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoREIN is a new unsupervised framework for 3D MP-qMRI reconstruction that integrates dual priors, improving imaging efficiency and clinical diagnosis accuracy.", "motivation": "Current qMRI reconstruction methods struggle with highly undersampled, high-dimensional data due to reliance on single prior or physics-informed models, leading to suboptimal results.", "method": "LoREIN incorporates low-rank and continuity priors through low-rank representation and implicit neural representation to enhance reconstruction fidelity.

As social media becomes central to daily\nlife, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior.\nFocusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their\nchannels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and\nhow do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches:\ncomputational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel\nlongitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with\nlife-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up\napproach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral\nindicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two\nalso showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health\nStruggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach,\na clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as\nsuicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal\neffects beyond those identified bottom-up.

Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and\neasily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific\nsolutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,\nsensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a\nmagnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly\ncustomizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a\nhobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired\nshape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,\nparameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and\nits mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts\nconvex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular\ndesign framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to\nadjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization\nexperiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE\nof 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for\nshear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to\nunseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that\nimprove manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving\n91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy\nfor successful completion.
