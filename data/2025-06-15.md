### [1] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This article introduces a conjecture that outlines the trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to make explicit and open to rigorous verification, the previously implicit trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems.

Method: The method involves reviewing historical motivations for this tension, stating the conjecture in information-theoretic form, contextualising it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology, and offering an analysis of its implications and consequences.

Result: The result is a reframing of both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. It clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

### [2] [One Patient, Many Contexts: Scaling Medical AI Through Contextual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10157)
*Michelle M. Li,Ben Y. Reis,Adam Rodman,Tianxi Cai,Noa Dagan,Ran D. Balicer,Joseph Loscalzo,Isaac S. Kohane,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Medical foundation models, despite their capabilities in summarizing clinical notes and aiding decision-making, face challenges in adapting to new contexts without retraining. This Perspective outlines a vision for context-switching AI that can dynamically adapt across specialties, populations, and clinical roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical foundation models struggle with dynamically adjusting their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care, leading to contextual errors where predictions fail to account for critical patient-specific or contextual information.

Method: The paper proposes the concept of context-switching in medical AI, which aims to develop models capable of dynamically adapting their reasoning without retraining to new specialties, populations, workflows, and clinical roles.

Result: This approach could lead to AI systems that diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across different specialties and regions, potentially expanding access to medical care.

Conclusion: Context-switching AI represents a promising direction for enhancing the adaptability and effectiveness of medical AI systems in diverse clinical situations.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

### [3] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the difference between causation and correlation in Alzheimer's disease research by using a mix of correlation analysis, machine learning classification with XGBoost, and model interpretability techniques like SHAP values. The study highlights that strong correlations don't necessarily imply causation and lays the groundwork for future causal inference studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the distinction between causation and correlation in Alzheimer's disease research to improve diagnosis, treatment, and identification of true disease drivers.

Method: The experiment uses a combination of methods including correlation analysis, machine learning classification (XGBoost), and model interpretability techniques (SHAP values) to investigate relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features.

Result: Key features influencing AD classification were identified, such as cognitive scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of interrelated variables and SHAP values provided insights into feature contributions across different disease stages.

Conclusion: Strong correlations do not necessarily imply causation, and careful interpretation of associative data is necessary. The integration of feature importance and interpretability with classical statistical analysis provides a foundation for future causal inference studies in Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

### [4] [Towards Responsible AI: Advances in Safety, Fairness, and Accountability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10192)
*Filip Cano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability of AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal domains.

Method: 1. Extend classical deterministic shielding techniques to be resilient against delayed observations. 2. Implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated autonomous vehicles. 3. Introduce fairness shields for enforcing group fairness in sequential decision-making settings. 4. Propose a formal framework for assessing intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents. 5. Unify these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework.

Result: Validated the use of safety shields in realistic driving simulators, introduced fairness shields that efficiently balance fairness with minimal interference, proposed a formal framework for assessing intentional behaviour useful for determining responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm.

Conclusion: The advancements presented contribute practically to the realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

### [5] [WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10264)
*Qiyue Yin,Pei Xu,Qiaozhe Li,Shengda Liu,Shengqi Shen,Tong Wang,Yihong Han,Xiaonan Zhao,Likun Yang,Shiyue Cao,Shiyu Qiu,Yuxuan Liu,Shizhao Yu,Lei Cui,Chengxin Yan,Jie Sun,Xiangquan Tang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent breakthroughs in LLMs have improved AI's reasoning abilities, but strategic reasoning has not been systematically evaluated. This paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic reasoning is a critical component of advanced human cognition, but it has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled in LLMs.

Method: The paper designs WGSR-Bench, which uses wargame as its evaluation environment and integrates environmental uncertainty, adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices. It designs test samples around three core tasks: Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling, and Policy generation.

Result: WGSR-Bench provides an effective testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning.

Conclusion: With WGSR-Bench, the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic strategic reasoning can be assessed, advancing research in large model-driven strategic intelligence.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

### [6] [Closer to Language than Steam: AI as the Cognitive Engine of a New Productivity Revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10281)
*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI is redefined as a cognitive engine sparking a new productivity revolution, distinct from the Industrial Revolution. This paper frames AI akin to written language—a transformative enhancement of human intellect rather than mechanized tool, showing its impact on knowledge work through historical comparisons and multidisciplinary perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To redefine AI as a cognitive revolution that transforms human intellect and productivity, distinct from past industrial changes focused on physical capabilities.

Method: Theoretical analysis comparing AI's emergence with historical leaps in information technology, using examples across domains and adopting a multidisciplinary perspective combining computer science, economics, and sociology.

Result: Demonstrates AI's role as an engine of cognition comparable to human language, reshaping work and society by enhancing cognitive productivity.

Conclusion: AI complements human cognitive abilities, marking a new chapter in productivity evolution, demanding rethinking skills, organizations, and policies.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

### [7] [The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304)
*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: As AI systems become more capable, verifying their safety becomes exponentially more complex. This paper proves that once system expressiveness exceeds a critical threshold, safety verification transitions into a coNP-complete problem which is computationally intractable. The authors propose a Capability-Risk Scaling dynamic and establish four core theorems to support this argument, ultimately presenting a strategic trilemma for AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to investigate the computational complexity barriers in verifying AI safety as system capabilities increase. With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, it becomes crucial to understand the challenges associated with ensuring safety, especially when systems surpass a certain level of expressiveness.

Method: The authors formalize the Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic and prove four core theorems. These theorems address the exponential growth of verification complexity, the diminishing fraction of safe policies within the policy space, the limitations of alignment techniques, and the measure-zero nature of robust safety properties in neural networks.

Result: The results show that safety verification requires exponential time once AI system expressiveness surpasses a critical threshold, making it coNP-complete. Additionally, safe policies become exceedingly rare, no finite set of alignment methods can universally cover all cases, and achieving robust safety in neural networks is exceptionally challenging.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by presenting a strategic trilemma for AI development: either constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable risks while scaling capabilities, or develop new safety paradigms beyond traditional verification. It provides a systematic complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [8] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGC-Bench, a benchmark for Pokemon VGC AI agents, providing infrastructure, datasets, and baselines to address the challenge of generalization across diverse team strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing AI agents capable of robustly adapting to different strategic landscapes without retraining is crucial in multi-agent learning. The complexity of Pokemon VGC with its large space of team configurations makes it an ideal domain to study this problem.

Method: Introduced VGC-Bench which includes critical infrastructure, standardized evaluation protocols, human-play datasets, and various baseline methods ranging from large-language-model agents to reinforcement learning and game-theoretic approaches.

Result: In single-team configuration settings, their methods can defeat professional VGC competitors. However, as team sizes grow, even the best algorithms struggle to scale effectively.

Conclusion: Policy generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge in the field.

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

*Zaijing Li,Yuquan Xie,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Weili Guan,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges through three key contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to build a generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft. This addresses the challenges of insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings.

Method: 1) A knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline for scalable and high-quality training data; 2) A Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing to mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks; 3) A Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance reasoning ability for visual diversity.

Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

Conclusion: Optimus-3 is presented as a general-purpose agent for Minecraft, overcoming the challenges of insufficient data, task interference, and visual diversity.

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a

high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large

*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework combining NEAT and PAL, accelerates learning in StarCraft macromanagement, achieving expert-level play with less training time and showcasing emergent human-like strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional AI approaches for StarCraft macromanagement, which struggle with adaptability and efficiency, by developing an enhanced neuroevolutionary method.

Method: Integrating Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning (PAL), where low-fidelity training alternates with high-fidelity evaluations to improve sample efficiency and strategy discovery.

Result: NeuroPAL reaches competitive gameplay levels in half the training time compared to NEAT alone and exhibits advanced human-like strategies such as proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL can improve the scalability and effectiveness of neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

*Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Kaiwen Zhou,Yinchuan Li,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. To solve these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module and Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm, and build Mirage-1 based on HMS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges faced by current GUI agents in handling long-horizon tasks in online environments, which are mainly caused by insufficient knowledge and the domain gap between offline and online environments.

Method: We propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module that progressively abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and meta-skills for long-horizon task planning. We also propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm to efficiently use offline-acquired skills during online tree exploration.

Result: Experimental results show that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32%, 19%, 15%, and 79% on AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH respectively.

Conclusion: Our proposed HMS module and SA-MCTS algorithm effectively tackle the issue of insufficient knowledge and bridge the domain gap, leading to superior performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,
MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively. Project page:

TL;DR: This paper reviews Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into predefined reasoning and agentic reasoning systems, analyzing techniques and discussing research challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of early RAG systems in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration.

Method: Comprehensive review and categorization of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods into predefined reasoning (fixed modular pipelines) and agentic reasoning (autonomous tool interaction).

Result: Analysis of representative techniques covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination.

Conclusion: Discusses key research challenges and proposes future directions to improve flexibility, robustness, and applicability of Reasoning Agentic RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing faces strict resource constraints, prompting the need for more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple elasticity dimensions.

Method: An agent-based autoscaling framework is introduced that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations. Four types of scaling agents are compared: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference. Two real-world processing services (YOLOv8 and OpenCV) are used as test cases.

Result: All agents achieved acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. The Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages.

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogiPlan, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' logical planning and reasoning capabilities over complex relational structures. It encompasses three tasks and reveals performance gaps among models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the abilities of large language models in logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures, which is crucial for applications relying on structured graphs of relations.

Method: Design a benchmark named LogiPlan with dynamic variation of task complexity. It includes three tasks: Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question. Also, models' self-correction capabilities are assessed.

Result: Significant performance gaps exist among evaluated state-of-the-art models, correlating with model scale and architecture. Recent reasoning-enhanced models perform well on simpler instances but struggle with more complex configurations.

Conclusion: LogiPlan provides a fine-grained assessment of LLMs' logical planning and reasoning capabilities, revealing challenges in handling complex relational structures.

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

*Mohd Anwar Jamal Faiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a new integer sequence combining classical primality with modular digit-based conditions. It proposes this sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic at scale.

Method: The authors define the Primender sequence and design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test a hypothesis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the sequence.

Result: Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to assess model performance.

Conclusion: This work contributes a novel mathematical construct and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An new diagnostic approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge for complex cyber-physical systems is presented. Experiments show its effectiveness in reducing search space and including true causal components, with potential for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require extensive prior knowledge, which is challenging to obtain.

Method: The method combines a neural network-based symptom generator using subsystem-level anomaly detection with a new graph diagnosis algorithm leveraging minimal causal relationship information between subsystems.

Result: Experiments with simulated datasets showed that the method includes the true causal component in 82% of cases and reduces the search space in 73% of scenarios. Tests on the Secure Water Treatment dataset demonstrated practical potential.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential for practical applications in large and complex cyber-physical systems where prior knowledge is limited.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents TeleMath, a benchmark dataset with 500 QnA pairs for evaluating LLMs' performance in solving telecommunications-related mathematical problems. It highlights that models designed for mathematical/logical reasoning perform best, while general-purpose LLMs often struggle. The dataset and evaluation code have been released to promote reproducibility and further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of LLMs in solving domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks within telecommunications, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis.

Method: Introduced TeleMath, a benchmark dataset consisting of 500 QnA pairs covering various telecommunications topics. Evaluated a range of open-source LLMs on this dataset.

Conclusion: TeleMath provides a valuable resource for assessing LLM performance in telecommunications-related mathematical problem-solving. The release of the dataset and evaluation code supports reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a pipeline that translates textual rules into SHACL constraints for validating AML models, demonstrating that complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked without requiring users to understand formal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, but current recommendations for proper AML modeling are informal and cannot be validated automatically within AML itself.

Method: The paper introduces a pipeline that maps AML models to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. Then, a Large Language Model translates textual rules into SHACL constraints which are validated against the generated AML ontology. Lastly, SHACL validation results are interpreted in natural language.

Result: The approach was demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation, showing that even complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked.

Conclusion: This method allows for the verification of AML modeling constraints without users needing to understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an effective system for handling real number computations and reasoning about continuous changes by combining answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories.

Method: Develop a compiler called aspsmt2smt which translates ASPMT programs into SMT instances. It uses gringo as grounder and z3 as SMT solver. gringo partially grounds input programs leaving some variables for z3 to process.

Result: The aspsmt2smt system can effectively handle real number computations for reasoning about continuous changes.

Conclusion: The successful implementation of aspsmt2smt demonstrates the potential of integrating ASPMT with SMT solvers for complex computations.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Motivation: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is challenging, and current neuro-symbolic models have limitations in answering counterfactual questions.

Method: Introduce causal graphs for representing causal relations among events and use ASP to coordinate perception and simulation modules. For CRAFT, leverage large pre-trained language models as dynamics simulators with symbolic causal reasoning providing alternative prompts.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on CLEVRER challenge; improved performance on CRAFT benchmark with the help of large language models.

Conclusion: The enhancement significantly boosts the model's ability to handle counterfactual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using historical feedback in optimization tasks and provides open-source resources to promote further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex

refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse

mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities in certain models, particularly Qwen2.5-Math-7B, even when using spurious rewards. Significant improvements were observed in Qwen models but not consistently across other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. The study highlights the potential of RLVR in uncovering pretraining knowledge and suggests that future research should validate on diverse models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how RLVR can improve mathematical reasoning in models despite using spurious rewards that have little to no correlation with correct answers. Specifically, to understand why this method works exceptionally well for Qwen models compared to others.

Method: Applied RLVR with various types of spurious rewards (random, format, incorrect label, 1-shot RL, majority voting) on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and compared its performance improvement against ground truth rewards. Also tested these rewards on other model families like Llama3 and OLMo2.

Result: RLVR significantly improved MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B with different spurious rewards, nearly matching the gains from ground truth rewards. This effect was unique to Qwen models, with other families not showing similar improvements. Code reasoning became more prevalent after RLVR in Qwen models.

Conclusion: RLVR appears to surface useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining when explicit reward signals are absent. Future research should focus on validating RLVR across diverse models rather than relying on a single model family due to the variability in results.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes NOCL, a novel framework that leverages node description and node concept techniques to extend LLMs for graph tasks, significantly reducing token lengths and demonstrating superior generalization in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Graph Neural Networks have limitations in generalization and applicability in label-scarce scenarios. Self-supervised approaches still require labeled fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Large Language Models face significant challenges when applied to graphs.

Method: The Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM (NOCL) framework uses two core techniques: node description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured natural language, and node concept, which encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained language models. It also employs graph representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a shared, language-based query format.

Result: Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: NOCL provides a new direction for Graph Foundation Models by extending LLMs from textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) to non-TAGs and significantly reducing token lengths.

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 研究人员利用深度学习进行薄膜传输光谱的逆向设计，提出了一种串联神经网络（TNN），探讨了不同算法配置对TNN性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学薄膜逆向设计方法耗时且需要大量数值模拟和优化过程，因此希望通过深度学习提高效率并解决one-to-many映射问题。

Method: 采用串联神经网络（TNN），由逆向神经网络和预训练前向神经网络组成，并探索了MLP、CNN和LSTM等算法的不同组合配置对TNN性能的影响。

Result: 基于LSTM-LSTM的TNN具有最高精度但训练时间最长；而基于CNN-LSTM的TNN在精度和速度之间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 通过使用深度学习和TNN结构，可以更高效地进行光学薄膜的逆向设计，其中CNN-LSTM配置是兼顾准确性和速度的最佳选择。

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO-based approaches in reinforcement learning treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, which leads to suboptimal data utilization and performance.

Method: Propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that considers both the inherent quality of each preference pair and the model's evolving performance on those pairs, adaptively weighting samples during training.

Result: On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO outperforms Claude 3 Opus by 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms baseline methods across all benchmarks.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO demonstrates superiority and generalization capabilities, with significant improvements in performance on various models and benchmarks.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

TL;DR: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越能够解决具有挑战性的现实世界任务，但准确量化其不确定性仍然是一个关键的开放性问题。本文通过贝叶斯视角看待基于LLM的系统，将提示词解释为统计模型中的文本参数，并引入MHLP算法进行贝叶斯推理。实证表明，该方法在一系列LLM基准和UQ任务上提高了预测准确性和不确定性量化能力。

Method: 将提示词视为统计模型中的文本参数，使用小型训练数据集对这些提示词执行贝叶斯推理。提出了Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP)，一种结合提示词优化技术与标准MCMC方法的新算法。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种将贝叶斯方法整合到LLM中的可行路径，有助于构建更可靠和校准良好的LLM系统。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Motivation: The motivation is to create a dependable base for deploying unsupervised representation learning in large-scale image clustering applications using an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST handwritten digits.

Method: The method involves a two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. In phase one, the model minimizes reconstruction errors to develop minimal yet interpretive representations of images.

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling personalized learning in federated learning while maintaining communication efficiency and preventing negative collaboration between clients.

Method: The method involves introducing a feature anchor to summarize local features, sharing classification heads among clients, using graph-based regularization for collaboration, modeling client collaboration as a dynamic graph, and applying community detection to partition the graph into homogeneous communities for positive interaction.

Result: Extensive experiments on two heterogeneous datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, computation and communication efficiency, and fairness across clients.

Conclusion: The novel federated multi-task learning method effectively leverages cross-client similarity for personalized learning, achieving superior results in efficiency, fairness, and performance.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

Conclusion: 非负扩散模型可以显著降低计算成本，同时生成符合物理规律的对象，为复杂自然现象的建模提供了一种新的有效方法。

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

Conclusion: GRAIL provides an evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments, addressing the gap left by current methods which focus on static graphs and prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably
efficient learning result in decentralized no-sensing MMAB with unknown arm
capacities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces offline domain randomization (ODR) for reducing the sim-to-real gap in reinforcement learning, formalizes it as maximum-likelihood estimation, proves estimator consistency, derives error bounds, and proposes E-DROPO with an entropy bonus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement-learning agents often face challenges when transitioning from simulation to real-world deployment due to the sim-to-real gap. Domain randomization (DR) is a common strategy but ignores valuable offline data from the real system.

Method: The authors formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood estimation over a parametric simulator family, prove the consistency of this estimator under certain conditions, derive gap bounds comparing ODR to uniform DR, and introduce a new algorithm called E-DROPO which incorporates an entropy bonus.

Result: The theoretical analysis shows that ODR can provide tighter error bounds compared to standard DR, and the introduction of E-DROPO demonstrates broader randomization and more robust zero-shot transfer in practical applications.

Conclusion: ODR leverages offline data to better bridge the sim-to-real gap in reinforcement learning. The proposed E-DROPO algorithm enhances performance through broader randomization.

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的表示学习目标，即带有$\text{BYOL-}\gamma$增强的GCBC方法，该方法无需对比样本或时序差分学习即可逼近继承者表示，并在需要组合泛化的任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆（BC）方法在机器人等领域中通过监督学习从人类演示中学习策略是一种有效的方法。目标条件策略使单一通用策略能够捕捉离线数据集中的多样化行为。然而，现有的目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）方法在训练任务上表现良好，但对需要新型状态-目标对条件的任务零样本泛化能力有限。这主要归因于BC学习的状态表示缺乏时间一致性。如果时间相关状态被编码为相似的潜在表示，则新状态-目标对的分布外差距将减少。因此，在表示空间中鼓励这种时间一致性应有助于组合泛化。

Method: 提出了一个简单而有效的表示学习目标，称为$\text{BYOL-}\gamma$增强GCBC。此方法理论上可以在没有对比样本或时序差分学习的情况下，在有限MDP情况下近似继承者表示。

Result: 该方法在一系列需要组合泛化的具有挑战性任务中展示了竞争力的实证性能。

Conclusion: $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$增强GCBC不仅能够在有限MDP情况下理论逼近继承者表示，而且在需要组合泛化的任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

### [42] [Interpreting learned search: finding a transition model and value function in an RNN that plays Sokoban](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10138)
*Mohammad Taufeeque,Aaron David Tucker,Adam Gleave,Adrià Garriga-Alonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A convolutional RNN trained to play Sokoban using model-free reinforcement learning leverages test-time compute through mechanisms similar to classic bidirectional search, with separate state representations for each box and layer-specific plan representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how a convolutional recurrent neural network trained with model-free reinforcement learning solves Sokoban puzzles and utilizes test-time compute effectively.

Method: Analysis of the RNN's activations and kernels reveals that it uses mechanisms analogous to classic bidirectional search, with separate state-action activations for each square and specialized kernels extending these activations to form paths.

Result: The RNN represents plans in channel activations, uses magnitudes for backtracking and pruning, considers each box separately, and has layer-specific plan representations and value functions.

Conclusion: The learned mechanisms in the RNN can be understood in familiar terms, showing that even though the network was trained without a model, its use of test-time compute is interpretable.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

### [43] [Survival Analysis as Imprecise Classification with Trainable Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10140)
*Andrei V. Konstantinov,Vlada A. Efremenko,Lev V. Utkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes three new survival models (iSurvM, iSurvQ, and iSurvJ) that combine imprecise probability theory with attention mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. Experiments show that these models outperform the Beran estimator in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survival analysis methods struggle with complex data structures and heavy censoring.

Method: The models represent censored observations by interval-valued probability distributions, employ kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson regression with trainable attention weights, and consider three decision strategies for training.

Result: The proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently outperform the Beran estimator in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The novel survival models provide a promising approach to handle censored data without making parametric assumptions.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

*Yaowen Zhang,Libera Fresiello,Peter H. Veltink,Dirk W. Donker,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes a novel PMB-NN framework for individualized heart rate estimation based on oxygen uptake data during daily activities, achieving high accuracy and enabling personalized cardiac monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heart failure poses a significant global health challenge. Early detection of heart failure can lead to improved outcomes, with abnormal heart rates serving as early indicators of risk. Current methods for heart rate estimation struggle with efficiency and interpretability, motivating the need for a new approach.

Method: A physiological-model-based neural network (PMB-NN) framework was developed, embedding physiological constraints derived from a simplified human movement physiological model into the neural network training process. The framework was trained and tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in various physical activities including resting, cycling, and running.

Result: The PMB-NN model achieved a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Statistical analysis showed that it performed comparably to benchmark neural network models while significantly outperforming traditional physiological models (p=0.002). Additionally, the PMB-NN is capable of identifying personalized parameters for the physiological model.

Conclusion: The proposed PMB-NN framework offers a promising method for personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical activities, using a precise VO2 estimation system derived from body movements.

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

### [45] [Balanced Hyperbolic Embeddings Are Natural Out-of-Distribution Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10146)
*Tejaswi Kasarla,Max van Spengler,Pascal Mettes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Balanced Hyperbolic Learning with hyperbolic class embedding for out-of-distribution recognition, which outperforms existing methods in empirical evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution recognition is a critical problem in deep learning, requiring effective methods to filter out samples not belonging to the trained distribution.

Method: The paper introduces Balanced Hyperbolic Learning, including a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that optimizes hierarchical distortion and balance. It uses these embeddings as prototypes for classification and generalizes scoring functions for hyperbolic prototypes.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that the proposed hyperbolic embeddings surpass existing out-of-distribution approaches, outperform other hyperbolic methods, and beat state-of-the-art contrastive methods.

Conclusion: A good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

### [46] [Probabilistic Variational Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10159)
*Minoh Jeong,Seonho Kim,Alfred Hero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that adds uncertainty quantification to contrastive learning methods by modeling probabilistic embeddings. It matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy and provides meaningful uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic embeddings learned through contrastive learning lack a principled mechanism for uncertainty quantification, which limits their applicability in certain scenarios.

Method: The method proposes Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL) that maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss and adding a KL divergence regularizer. The approximate posterior is modeled as a projected normal distribution, allowing sampling of probabilistic embeddings.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: VCL equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation, serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) is proposed to improve sample efficiency in continuous control tasks with sparse rewards. It employs a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor for exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have poor sample efficiency, especially in environments with sparse rewards.

Method: Propose the Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm which uses a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor for exploration. The exploration policy is the Wasserstein barycenter of these two policies.

Result: WBSAC outperforms state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms in terms of sample-efficiency on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: WBSAC provides a principled directed exploration strategy that improves sample efficiency in continuous control domains.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

TL;DR: Diffusion-based generative models show that sampling trajectories are in low-dimensional subspaces with a 'boomerang' shape. This paper proposes a dynamic programming-based scheme to improve image generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal the geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion-based generative models and improve image generation performance.

Method: Characterize properties of sampling trajectories under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling and propose a dynamic programming-based scheme to align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure.

Result: The proposed strategy requires minimal modification, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function evaluations.

Conclusion: The discovered trajectory regularity can be used to improve the efficiency and performance of diffusion-based generative models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE is a framework that performs representation learning and adaptive OOD detection, evolving with data to capture new trends through a non-parametric clustering mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns, which are often overlooked by majority of models leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: Introduction of DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and adaptive OOD detection. It dynamically updates its latent structure to capture new trends using a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism inspired by Gaussian Mixture Models.

Result: DynaSubVAE achieves competitive performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, excelling in class-OOD scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. The dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone clustering methods like GMM and KMeans++ in terms of OOD accuracy and regret precision.

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE provides an effective solution for detecting and adapting to underrepresented groups in real-world data.

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM pruning and quantization methods.

Conclusion: AWP provides theoretical convergence guarantees for pruning and offers an effective solution for compressing large language models.

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model
compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed,
especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training
quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight
pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for
Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent
(AWP). Our experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM
pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the
proposed method for pruning are also provided.

*Sajjad Karimi,Amit J. Shah,Gari D. Clifford,Reza Sameni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the common and exclusive characteristics of ECG and PCG using a dataset called EPHNOGRAM. It uses various machine learning models, finding that non-causal LSTM offers superior reconstruction performance. The study also shows that clinically relevant ECG biomarkers can be estimated from PCG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate the common and exclusive characteristics of ECG and PCG signals, their potential for mutual reconstruction, and the extraction of biomarkers under varying physiological conditions and across individuals.

Method: Employing linear and nonlinear machine learning models (including non-causal LSTM networks) to reconstruct each modality from the other and analyzing the influence of causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability.

Result: Nonlinear models, especially non-causal LSTM, provide superior reconstruction performance. Reconstructing ECG from PCG is more feasible than the reverse. Envelope-based modeling improves cross-subject generalizability. Clinically relevant ECG biomarkers can be estimated from PCG in cross-subject settings.

Conclusion: The findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between electromechanical cardiac modalities, with implications for novel multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

*Chen-Chia Chang,Wan-Hsuan Lin,Yikang Shen,Yiran Chen,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaMAGIC2 is a new framework that improves analog topology generation by enhancing component-type recognition, reducing token length complexity, and improving numeric precision sensitivity. It achieves higher success rates, lower MSEs, and better transferability compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.

Method: LaMAGIC2 introduces a succinct float-input canonical formulation with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation. SFCI improves component-type recognition through identifier-based representations, reduces token length complexity to O(|V|), and enhances numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight tolerances.

Result: Experiments show that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a prior method. It also exhibits better transferability for circuits with more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2 establishes itself as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a

more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

*Yuji Kawamata,Kaoru Kamijo,Maki Kihira,Akihiro Toyoda,Tomoru Nakayama,Akira Imakura,Tetsuya Sakurai,Yukihiko Okada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DC-Clustering, a novel federated clustering method that supports complex data partitioning scenarios in federated learning while preserving privacy and achieving performance comparable to centralized clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated clustering methods can only handle simple data partitioning scenarios such as horizontal or vertical splits, but cannot deal with more complex distributed structures where these splits coexist.

Method: DC-Clustering is proposed, which allows each institution to share only intermediate representations rather than raw data. It supports flexible selection between k-means and spectral clustering algorithms and achieves final clustering results with just one round of communication with the central server.

Result: Extensive experiments using synthetic and open benchmark datasets show that DC-Clustering achieves clustering performance comparable to centralized clustering, where all data are pooled together.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering fills an important gap in current federated learning research by enabling effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. It is promising for privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare and finance due to its properties of privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and flexibility.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

### [59] [Meta-learning Representations for Learning from Multiple Annotators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10259)
*Atsutoshi Kumagai,Tomoharu Iwata,Taishi Nishiyama,Yasutoshi Ida,Yasuhiro Fujiwara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A meta-learning method is proposed to learn accurate classifiers from limited noisy annotated data by utilizing labeled data from related tasks and embedding examples into a latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many applications, labels for supervised learning are provided by multiple annotators with varying skills or biases, leading to noisy data. Existing methods require large amounts of such noisy data to learn accurate classifiers, which may not be available in practice.

Method: The proposed method uses labeled data from different but related tasks. It embeds each example in these tasks to a latent space using a neural network and constructs a probabilistic model to learn task-specific classifiers while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent space. The neural network is meta-learned to improve test classification performance when adapted to a small amount of annotated data. Classifier adaptation is done by maximizing the posterior probability via the EM algorithm.

Result: The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using real-world datasets with synthetic noise and real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed meta-learning method can efficiently learn accurate classifiers from limited noisy annotated data by leveraging related task data and the EM algorithm.

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

### [60] [Interior-Point Vanishing Problem in Semidefinite Relaxations for Neural Network Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10269)
*Ryota Ueda,Takami Sato,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation is a promising approach for neural network verification, but it faces the challenge of interior-point vanishing when applied to deep networks. This paper analyzes this issue and proposes five solutions to enhance feasibility conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical limitation of SDP relaxation in neural network verification, specifically the issue of interior-point vanishing which affects the numerical stability and optimality as network depth increases.

Method: The authors conduct rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis to demonstrate the loss of strict feasibility with increasing DNN depth. They design and investigate five solutions to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem and re-evaluate the traditionally used constraints for ReLU units.

Result: The proposed methods can solve 88% of previously unsolvable problems, accounting for 41% of the total problems. It is also found that traditional constraints for ReLU bounds may be harmful to feasibility.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into the challenges of SDP-based DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to deeper neural networks, contributing to more reliable and secure DNN systems.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

*Penguin Huang,Chhavi Yadav,Ruihan Wu,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PropInfer, a benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms and proposes two tailored attacks which reveal a previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if property inference attacks transfer to LLMs, given the sensitive and confidential dataset-level properties in fine-tuning datasets.

Method: Introduced PropInfer benchmark task for evaluating property inference in LLMs with two fine-tuning paradigms and proposed two tailored attacks: prompt-based generation attack and shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals.

Result: Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of the proposed attacks.

Conclusion: Property inference attacks can be successfully applied to LLMs, revealing a previously unrecognized vulnerability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

### [62] [Graph-MLLM: Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10282)
*Jiajin Liu,Dongzhe Fan,Jiacheng Shen,Chuanhao Ji,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful but often neglect structural relationships in multimodal graphs (MMGs). Existing MMG learning methods leverage MLLMs in three ways: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor. A new benchmark, Graph-MLLM, evaluates these approaches across six datasets, showing that combining visual and textual attributes benefits graph learning, converting visuals to text improves performance, and fine-tuning MLLMs achieves state-of-the-art results without explicit graph structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs focus on modality alignment rather than structural relationships in MMGs, and there is a lack of a unified benchmark for fair evaluation across different MMG learning methods.

Method: The authors introduce Graph-MLLM, a benchmark for evaluating MMG learning methods based on three paradigms: MLLM-as-Encoder, MLLM-as-Aligner, and MLLM-as-Predictor. They conduct extensive experiments on six datasets from different domains.

Result: Jointly considering visual and textual attributes benefits graph learning; converting visual attributes into textual descriptions further improves performance; fine-tuning MLLMs on specific MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results even without explicit graph structure information.

Conclusion: The authors hope that the open-sourced Graph-MLLM library will facilitate equitable evaluation and inspire future research in multimodal graph learning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分组的多臂老虎机设置中，各组之间共享奖励观察值，目标是最小化协作遗憾（定义为各组之间的最大遗憾）。此问题旨在平衡组或人群之间的探索负担，因为标准算法可能导致组间探索成本显著不平衡。

Method: 引入了一种名为Col-UCB的算法，该算法可以动态协调组间的探索。此方法不仅考虑了共享动作集的结构，还提供了关于何时协作能带来显著好处的见解。

Result: Col-UCB算法实现了最优的最小最大和实例依赖的协作遗憾，其界限适应于组间共享动作集的结构。

Conclusion: 通过动态协调组间的探索，Col-UCB算法能够有效减少协作遗憾，并且在理论上达到了最优性能。这表明在某些情况下，组间的协作学习比独立学习更有效。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using meta-learning to detect malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia, which outperforms pre-trained models and releases a new dataset for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning approaches for detecting malicious sockpuppets rely on stylistic and meta-data features but lack adaptability to author-specific behaviours, especially in data-scarce settings.

Method: The application of meta-learning technique is proposed to train models across multiple tasks, optimizing the model for rapid adaptation to the writing style of new sockpuppet-groups.

Result: Meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to pre-trained models in detecting sockpuppets.

Conclusion: Meta-learning improves the detection of malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia and contributes to combating sockpuppetry on open editing platforms. A new dataset is released to promote further research.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

*Paul Janson,Benjamin Therien,Quentin Anthony,Xiaolong Huang,Abhinav Moudgil,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PyLO is a PyTorch-based library that makes learned optimizers more accessible, providing speedups and integration with existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to make learned optimizers more accessible to the broader machine learning community by addressing gaps such as reliance on JAX and lack of user-friendly packages after meta-training.

Method: PyLO introduces a PyTorch-based library for learned optimizers, including a CUDA-accelerated version of an optimizer architecture, focusing on real-world large-scale pre-training tasks.

Result: Significant speedups were achieved (from 39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16) and learned optimizers benefited from combination with existing optimization tools.

Conclusion: PyLO successfully brings learned optimizers to a wider audience through familiar workflows in PyTorch, enhancing both accessibility and performance.

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution is a major health risk in developing countries and current AQI data does not accurately reflect local conditions due to sparse sensor distribution.

Method: Employing Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict AQI values within 1 km^2 neighborhoods based on the AirDelhi dataset.

Result: Achieved a 79% reduction in MSE compared to previous methods, even for unseen coordinates, revealing strong repetitive short-term patterns and changing spatial relations in AQI.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal GNNs significantly improve AQI predictions at localized levels, offering better insights into air quality dynamics.

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper formalizes the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, introduces transfer eluder dimension as a complexity measure, and develops a no-regret algorithm called HELiX that solves LLF problems with performance guarantees scaling with the transfer eluder dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of principled framing for decision problems in interactive learning from observation and language feedback, especially given the rise of large language model (LLM) agents.

Method: The method includes formalizing the LLF problem, asserting sufficient assumptions for learning despite latent rewards, introducing the transfer eluder dimension as a complexity measure, and developing the HELiX algorithm which solves LLF problems through sequential interactions.

Result: HELiX performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs does not work reliably. Cases are demonstrated where learning from rich language feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward.

Conclusion: The contributions mark a first step towards designing principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生理信号常受到运动伪影、基线漂移和其他低信噪比干扰的影响，同时表现出强烈的非平稳性，难以用传统时域或滤波方法表示。因此需要一种新方法来捕捉多尺度时频特征。

Method: 提出了一种基于小波变换的方法，开发了针对EMG和ECG的两个大规模预训练模型，并构建了一个统一的多模态框架，通过可学习的加权融合将各模态信号整合。

Result: 在下游任务中取得了优越性能，设置了新的基准；在多模态任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该小波变换架构为多样化生理信号分析提供了坚实基础，而多模态设计则指明了下一代生理信号处理的方向，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal
tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for
analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical
applications.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop an end-to-end learning framework that can model the hidden dynamics governing irreversible evolution of material responses without relying on hidden state variables.

Method: The method involves developing HANO, an autoregressive model based on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone with a hierarchical self-attention mechanism. This allows for discretization-invariant learning and multiscale feature extraction.

Result: HANO outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness when evaluated on elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive anisotropic damage in brittle solids.

Conclusion: HANO provides an effective data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is suitable for integration with classical numerical solvers.

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Experiments on vision transformers and large language models show its effectiveness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment where learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual learning (CL) to update models online while preventing catastrophic forgetting. With the rise of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become increasingly critical for CL due to their substantial computational demands and growing parameter sizes.

It constructs layer-wise adapters by leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL, particularly for LPMs. Bandit techniques are employed to develop an algorithm based on lower confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Sparse gradient updates are used to facilitate parameter optimization.

Result: Experiments on both vision transformers (ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TreeLoRA across various domains, including vision and natural language processing tasks.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA provides a novel approach for efficient continual learning of large pre-trained models by constructing layer-wise adapters, employing bandit techniques, and using sparse gradient updates. Theoretical analysis justifies the rationale behind the approach, and experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers

*Jikai Jin,Vasilis Syrgkanis,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal representation learning framework is proposed to evaluate language model capabilities through latent capability factors, revealing a causal direction from problem-solving to math reasoning and emphasizing the importance of controlling base model variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for model development but faces challenges like complex confounding effects and high computational costs.

Method: The paper proposes a causal representation learning framework that models observed benchmark performance as a linear transformation of latent capability factors, identified as causally interrelated after controlling for the base model as a common confounder.

Result: A concise three-node linear causal structure was identified, explaining performance variations and providing insights into the causal direction from general problem-solving, through instruction-following, to mathematical reasoning ability.

Conclusion: Carefully controlling base model variations during evaluation is essential to accurately uncover the underlying causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges associated with using LLMs for evaluating the quality of LLM generations and responses, such as high API costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases.

Method: The method introduced in this paper is PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model Assessment), which synthesizes executable judging programs using LLMs instead of directly scoring responses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM

*Bryan Shaddy,Brianna Binder,Agnimitra Dasgupta,Haitong Qin,James Haley,Angel Farguell,Kyle Hilburn,Derek V. Mallia,Adam Kochanski,Jan Mandel,Assad Oberai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to estimate wildfire progression using VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height data by employing a conditional Generative Adversarial Network trained with WRF-SFIRE simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an increasing need for accurate wildfire spread prediction due to rising wildfire occurrences. Current complex models diverge from observed data during multi-day simulations, necessitating data assimilation techniques.

Method: A conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) is developed and trained on historic wildfire data from WRF-SFIRE model. Fire progression is represented by fire arrival time, and the cGAN incorporates atmospheric and terrain information. The model uses satellite and terrain data to generate fire progression estimates.

Result: The approach was validated on five Pacific US wildfires, achieving an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81 when compared against high-resolution aircraft-measured perimeters. Terrain height had minimal influence on the inference when conditioned on satellite measurements.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a novel approach for estimating wildfire progression through the use of a cGAN, providing a promising tool for wildfire prediction.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An abstract about a new method for soil organic carbon sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring needs representative field sampling locations based on environmental covariates.

Method: A hybrid methodology integrating spectral clustering with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). Spectral clustering partitions the study area into homogeneous zones using multivariate covariate data, and cLHS selects sampling locations within each zone.

Result: Spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS.

Conclusion: This improved sampling design could yield more accurate SOC predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning models.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to automate the optimization of PCB schematics by adding necessary components, reducing manual labor and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of skilled engineers and manual optimizations in PCB design are time-consuming, often leading to neglected best practices, higher troubleshooting costs, shortened product life cycles, and increased electronic waste.

Method: PCB schematics are represented as bipartite graphs and a node pair prediction model based on GNNs is utilized to automate the addition of new components into these schematics.

Result: GNNs can solve PCB design optimization problems with high accuracy. The approach was tested on three relevant tasks with real-world datasets labeled by human experts.

Conclusion: The presented approach has the potential to automate PCB design optimizations efficiently, saving time and costs.

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

*Antonio Ferrara,Francesco Cozzi,Alan Perotti,André Panisson,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An abstract of a paper introducing a unified, size-adaptive hypothesis-testing framework for fairness assessment in algorithmic decision-making systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for assessing discrimination in algorithmic decision-making systems are statistically brittle and unreliable, especially when dealing with intersectional analyses.

Method: The authors introduce a Central-Limit result for large subgroups leading to analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test, while for small intersectional groups they derive a Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimator with Monte-Carlo credible intervals.

Result: Empirical validation on benchmark datasets shows that the tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions across different levels of data availability and intersectionality.

Conclusion: This new framework offers an evidence-based statistical approach for assessing fairness in algorithmic decision-making systems.

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

### [84] [Deep Learning-Based Digitization of Overlapping ECG Images with Open-Source Python Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10617)
*Reza Karbasi,Masoud Rahimi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie,Hadi Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-stage pipeline for digitizing paper-based ECG recordings, especially addressing signal overlaps. It uses a U-Net based segmentation network followed by an adaptive grid detection module to convert the binary mask into a time-series signal. The method significantly improves digitization accuracy compared to baseline techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately digitizing paper-based ECG recordings remains a challenge, particularly when dealing with single leads compromised by signal overlaps which are under-addressed in existing methodologies.

Method: The method involves a two-stage pipeline: 1) A U-Net based segmentation network trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and custom data augmentations to isolate the primary ECG trace. 2) An adaptive grid detection module that converts the refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques.

Result: The U-Net architecture achieved an IoU of 0.87 for fine-grained segmentation. For non-overlapping signals, the proposed method outperformed the baseline with MSE of 0.0010 vs 0.0015 and rho of 0.9644 vs 0.9366. On samples with signal overlap, it achieved MSE of 0.0029 vs 0.0178 and rho of 0.9641 vs 0.8676.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage pipeline demonstrates an effective strategy to enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thus enabling reliable conversion of analog ECG records into digital data for research and clinical applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

*Thu Ha Phi,Alexandre Hippert-Ferrer,Florent Bouchard,Arnaud Breloy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph learning framework that uses a low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix and applies Riemannian optimization techniques to solve optimization problems, offering an efficient dimension-performance trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scalability issue in learning undirected graphs from node data when the number of variables (nodes) is large by leveraging a low-rank factorization approach.

Method: The method involves deriving tools for Riemannian optimization to solve the optimization problems resulting from the low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix. It also particularizes this approach to a low-rank constrained version of the GLasso algorithm.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that this approach achieves a very efficient trade-off between dimension and performance.

Conclusion: The proposed graph learning framework successfully tackles the scalability problem and offers an effective solution with good performance at high dimensions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

*Yucheng Yang,Tianyi Zhou,Qiang He,Lei Han,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Meng Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LSEPIN and WSEP to improve upon MISL for unsupervised reinforcement learning, providing theoretical justification and new algorithms for better downstream task adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised reinforcement learning aims to learn general skills for unseen tasks. While MISL addresses this by maximizing mutual information between states and skills, it lacks sufficient theoretical analysis regarding the quality of learned skills for initializing downstream task policies.

Method: The authors propose a disentanglement metric LSEPIN, connect it to downstream task adaptation cost via information-geometric analysis, replace KL divergence with Wasserstein distance for improved geometric properties, develop the skill-learning objective WSEP, and introduce the algorithm PWSEP to discover all optimal initial policies.

Result: WSEP is theoretically justified to aid downstream task adaptation and can discover more initial policies than MISL. PWSEP can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The diversity and separability of learned skills are critical for downstream task adaptation. The proposed methods, LSEPIN, WSEP, and PWSEP, offer improvements over MISL in terms of theoretical guarantees and practical performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

*Yucong Luo,Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Jiahao Wang,Daoyu Wang,Tingyue Pan,Jintao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-R1 is a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework that enhances the multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting, significantly improving forecast performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series forecasting methods rely on extracting historical patterns and mapping them to future values, lacking an explicit thinking process with intermediate time series reasoning. Slow-thinking LLMs offer multi-step reasoning capabilities but face limitations such as high computational cost and privacy risks when using prompt engineering alone.

Method: The proposed method, Time-R1, includes a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework. The first stage conducts supervised fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage uses reinforcement learning to improve generalization ability. A fine-grained multi-objective reward is designed specifically for time series forecasting, and GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization) leverages non-uniform sampling to optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Time-R1 effectively enhances the multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for analyzing the latent space geometry of generative models by reconstructing the Fisher information metric, revealing phase transitions and providing insights into diffusion model latent spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the complex structure of latent spaces in generative models, such as statistical physics models and diffusion models, by reconstructing the Fisher information metric.

Method: Approximate the posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for exponential families. Validate the method on Ising and TASEP models and apply it to diffusion models.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities on the Ising and TASEP models. In diffusion models, it reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric and divergent Lipschitz constant at phase boundaries.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the latent space geometry of generative models, particularly diffusion models, and their connection to phenomena like phase transitions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

### [89] [Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10647)
*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain of Thought (CoT) improves transformers' ability to solve difficult problems like the $k$-parity problem, but its effectiveness is impacted by data shifts and poisoning. This study investigates these impacts and finds that CoT can lead to worse performance than direct prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how distribution shifts and data poisoning affect the quality of models trained with CoT decomposition on the $k$-parity problem.

Method: Investigate the joint impact of distribution shifts and data poisoning on models trained with CoT decomposition for the $k$-parity problem.

Result: Revealed that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity than directly generating the prediction, with a rigorous explanation provided.

Conclusion: CoT's effectiveness in solving difficult problems is significantly impacted by real-world conditions such as data shifts and poisoning.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

Motivation: 尽管自组织映射（SOMs）具有可解释性和高效性，但它们在连续学习任务中仍然面临灾难性遗忘的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)的新方法，该方法通过逐渐降低神经元的学习率和邻域半径来冻结训练良好的神经元，并将学习重定向到地图中未充分利用的区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，SatSOM在连续学习场景下能有效提升知识保留能力。

Conclusion: SatSOM为解决连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 现代神经网络经常编码任务无关的不想要的概念，导致公平性和可解释性问题。现有的事后方法可以去除不需要的概念，但往往会损害有用的信号。本文提出了一种名为SPLICE的方法，它可以在去除敏感概念的同时精确地保留与目标标签的协方差。SPLICE通过斜投影实现这一目标，理论上它是唯一能够去除线性概念预测性并保持目标协方差且嵌入失真最小的解决方案。实证上，SPLICE在诸如Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中优于基线方法，在去除受保护属性的同时对主任务信息的损害最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在执行特定任务时，可能会同时编码一些不想要的概念，这引发了公平性和可解释性方面的担忧。虽然已有的事后处理方法可以去除这些不需要的概念，但往往会对有用的信息造成损害。因此，需要一种能够在去除不需要的概念的同时尽量减少对有用信息损害的方法。

Method: 本文提出了SPLICE（Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal and Covariance prEservation）方法，该方法通过斜投影技术来消除表示中的敏感概念，同时精确地保留这些表示与目标标签之间的协方差。具体而言，SPLICE将不需要的方向从表示中“切除”，同时保护重要的标签相关性。

Result: 理论上，SPLICE是唯一能够去除线性概念预测性、保持目标协方差并且使嵌入失真最小的解决方案。实证结果表明，SPLICE在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，例如在Bias in Bios和Winobias数据集上，SPLICE能够在去除受保护属性的同时，对主要任务信息的损害降到最低。

Conclusion: SPLICE提供了一种有效的方法来解决现代神经网络中存在的公平性和可解释性问题。它不仅能够去除不需要的概念，而且最大限度地保留了有用的信息，从而为实际应用提供了更好的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

TL;DR: ConTextTab is introduced, which integrates semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current table-native ICL architectures are trained exclusively on synthetic data and do not fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. On the other hand, models based on pretrained large language models have deep semantic understanding but can only use a small amount of context due to architectural limitations.

Method: Introduce ConTextTab, which employs specialized embeddings for different data modalities and trains on large-scale real-world tabular data.

Result: ConTextTab is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

Conclusion: ConTextTab successfully combines the advantages of both table-native ICL architectures and pretrained large language model-based tabular ICL models.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

Motivation: There is a need for reliable automated question answering systems in healthcare that can provide accurate information from electronic health records (EHRs) with limited supervision.

Method: Neural decouples the QA task into two stages - sentence-level evidence identification and answer synthesis with explicit citations. It uses DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer for data-driven prompt optimization, tuning instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A self-consistency voting scheme enhances evidence recall while maintaining precision.

Result: Neural achieved an overall score of 51.5 on the hidden test set of the BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA shared task, placing second and outperforming zero-shot and few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points respectively.

Conclusion: Data-driven prompt optimization provides a cost-effective alternative to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, improving the reliability of AI assistants in healthcare.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of

Motivation: 现有的单调分类研究只能以绝对因子超过最优误差，而本文旨在通过相对因子控制误差，即允许误差比最优值高出至多$(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$倍。

Method: 研究定义了算法的成本为揭示标签的点的数量，并提出了一种方法来寻找满足误差要求的单调分类器$h$。对于整个$\epsilon$范围，文章给出了接近的上界和下界。

Conclusion: 本文首次解决了以相对因子控制单调分类器误差的问题，并为该问题提供了理论上的成本界限，推动了单调分类领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new energy function called log-sum-ReLU (LSR) for Dense Associative Memory networks, inspired by optimal kernel density estimation. It allows exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity and introduces emergent local minima while preserving perfect pattern recovery. Empirical results show that LSR has significantly more local minima with comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models and shows creativity and novelty in image datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function in Dense Associative Memory networks, such as requiring exponential separation functions for exact memory retrieval, this paper proposes an alternative energy function based on the Epanechnikov kernel.

Method: The proposed method involves introducing a novel energy function, log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density estimation using the Epanechnikov kernel. This function enables exact memory retrieval without needing exponential separation functions and introduces emergent local minima while maintaining perfect pattern recovery.

Result: Empirical results indicate that the LSR energy function has significantly more local minima (memories) compared to LSE-based models, with comparable log-likelihoods. Analysis of emergent memories on image datasets reveals creativity and novelty.

Conclusion: The log-sum-ReLU energy function provides a promising approach for Dense Associative Memory networks, offering exponential capacity, abundant local minima, and preserved perfect pattern recovery. Its potential applications include large-scale memory storage and generative tasks.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting high-stakes interactions in LLMs is crucial for safe deployment, yet it remains underexplored. Current monitoring methods using prompted or finetuned medium-sized LLMs are computationally expensive.

Method: The researchers evaluated several probe architectures trained on synthetic data to detect high-stakes interactions. These probes were tested for their generalization to out-of-distribution, real-world data. They compared the performance of these probes against prompted or finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors.

Result: The probes showed robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution, real-world data. Their performance was comparable to that of medium-sized LLM monitors while offering computational savings of six orders-of-magnitude. Experiments also highlighted the potential for building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems.

Conclusion: Activation probes can serve as an efficient initial filter in hierarchical monitoring systems for LLMs, flagging high-stakes interactions for more detailed analysis. The researchers released a novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage further research.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the efficiency robustness of Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs), introduces a taxonomy of efficiency attacks, and identifies challenges in securing DDLSs along with limitations of current defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to systematically explore the efficiency robustness of DDLSs and understand how dynamic behavior introduces new vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.

Method: The authors categorize efficiency adversarial attacks based on three dynamic behaviors of DDLSs and evaluate adversarial strategies targeting DDLSs' efficiency. They also analyze existing defense mechanisms.

Result: A comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks is presented, and key challenges in securing DDLSs are identified. The limitations of current defense mechanisms against efficiency attacks are demonstrated.

Conclusion: Novel mitigation strategies are necessary to secure future adaptive DDLSs from increasingly popular efficiency adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

*Pierre-François Massiani,Alexander von Rohr,Lukas Haverbeck,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how entropy regularization and constraints penalization in reinforcement learning (RL) can promote robust safety under unknown disturbances. It shows that entropy regularization biases learning towards maximizing viable actions, improving resilience to action noise. Relaxing strict safety constraints with penalties allows the constrained RL problem to be approximated by an unconstrained one, preserving safety and optimality while enhancing disturbance resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning policies in RL that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown disturbances.

Method: Analyzing the interplay between entropy regularization and constraints penalization in model-free RL. Revealing empirically that entropy regularization inherently biases learning towards maximizing viable actions and promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise. Approximating the constrained RL problem arbitrarily closely by an unconstrained one through penalties.

Result: This reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving resilience to disturbances.

Conclusion: The connection between entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further empirical and theoretical investigation, enabling robust safety in RL through simple reward shaping.

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper discusses the problem of attacking finite mixtures of classifiers (randomized ensembles) in a principled way, introduces two desirable properties for attacks (effectiveness and maximality), shows that existing attacks lack these properties, and proposes a new attack called lattice climber attack with theoretical guarantees.


<details>

Motivation: Finite mixtures of classifiers (randomized ensembles) have been proposed to improve robustness against adversarial attacks, but current attacks are not suitable for this kind of classifier.

Method: The authors introduce two desirable properties for attacks on randomized ensembles (effectiveness and maximality) based on geometrical analysis, demonstrate that existing attacks do not satisfy both properties, and propose a new attack called lattice climber attack with theoretical guarantees in the binary linear setting.

Result: The lattice climber attack outperforms existing attacks in experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by introducing the lattice climber attack as a novel method to effectively attack finite mixtures of classifiers, providing theoretical guarantees and experimental evidence.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

TL;DR: Duo is a method that enhances uniform-state discrete diffusion models by transferring techniques from Gaussian diffusion, using curriculum learning and Discrete Consistency Distillation to improve training and sampling respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models have the potential for fast text generation but are outperformed by autoregressive and masked diffusion models. The authors aim to narrow this performance gap.

Method: The Duo method introduces two key improvements: 1) Curriculum learning guided by a Gaussian process to increase training speed and reduce variance, and 2) Discrete Consistency Distillation which adapts consistency distillation for the discrete setting to accelerate sampling.

Result: Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Discrete Consistency Distillation accelerates sampling by two orders of magnitude, enabling few-step generation in diffusion language models.

Conclusion: Duo successfully transfers techniques from Gaussian diffusion to enhance both training and sampling in uniform-state discrete diffusion models, leading to improved performance.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

### [103] [NoLoCo: No-all-reduce Low Communication Training Method for Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10911)
*Jari Kolehmainen,Nikolay Blagoev,John Donaghy,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Christopher Nies*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NoLoCo, an optimization method that reduces communication overhead during large language model training by implicitly synchronizing model weights without explicit parameter synchronization or collective communication. It offers faster convergence and less accelerator idling compared to DiLoCo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models requires expensive, high-bandwidth clusters due to the need for frequent model parameter synchronization, which becomes impractical at scale. Current low-communication methods still involve costly synchronization steps on low-bandwidth networks.

Method: NoLoCo is a novel optimization method that avoids explicit synchronization of all model parameters by partially averaging weights with randomly selected others using a variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer. This eliminates the need for collective communication.

Result: NoLoCo achieves significantly less communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training and DiLoCo, with synchronization estimated to be one magnitude faster for internet-based training. It also shows up to 4% faster convergence across various model sizes and accelerator counts compared to DiLoCo.

Conclusion: NoLoCo provides an efficient alternative for large-scale model training by reducing communication costs and improving convergence rates without global blocking communication.

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

TL;DR: CausalFM is a new framework for training PFN-based foundation models to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. It uses causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks and performs competitively for CATE estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To introduce a comprehensive framework (CausalFM) for training PFN-based foundation models in various causal inference settings, offering a novel paradigm that could fundamentally change how practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other disciplines.

Method: Formalize the construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on SCMs, derive necessary criteria for their validity, propose a novel family of prior distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks, instantiate CausalFM, and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating CATEs using back-door adjustment.

Result: CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: CausalFM can be used as a general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference settings, potentially changing the current state-of-the-art in causal inference.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other

*Morris Yau,Sharut Gupta,Valerie Engelmayer,Kazuki Irie,Stefanie Jegelka,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modern neural sequence models like Gated Linear Attention and Mamba achieve sequential-parallel duality. This paper explores the full class of such models that support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space sequential inference by defining Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs). PSMs generalize existing architectures while introducing new models with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify and characterize the entire class of neural sequence models that can be trained in parallel and allow fast sequential inference.

Method: Describes state space models whose state updates can be computed using the classic parallel prefix scan algorithm. Then defines a more general class called Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs) which relaxes the aggregation operator to include arbitrary functions such as softmax attention.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while matching the inference efficiency of state space models. They also exhibit better length generalization in some cases.

Conclusion: Prefix-Scannable Models provide a broad framework for designing efficient neural sequence models with strong performance.

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) used in hiring can have significant racial and gender biases when realistic context is added, despite anti-bias prompts. The study introduces internal bias mitigation which neutralizes sensitive attribute directions within model activations, reducing bias to very low levels while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of simple anti-bias prompts in eliminating demographic biases in LLMs when realistic contextual details are introduced in hiring applications.

Method: Identify and neutralize sensitive attribute directions within model activations using affine concept editing at inference time, based on race and gender-correlated directions from a synthetic dataset.

Result: Internal bias mitigation reduces bias to very low levels (typically under 1%, always below 2.5%) across leading commercial and open-source models, while largely maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies for equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) are static and lack adaptation mechanisms. This paper introduces Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that allows LLMs to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of large language models being static and unable to adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples.

Method: The framework SEAL enables LLMs to self-adapt by producing self-edits which can restructure information, specify optimization hyperparameters, or invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. The model is trained to produce effective self-edits through a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream performance of the updated model as the reward signal.

Result: Experiments on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization indicate that SEAL shows promise toward developing language models capable of self-directed adaptation.

Conclusion: SEAL is introduced as a promising approach for enabling large language models to self-adapt without relying on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our

### [109] [GUARD: Guided Unlearning and Retention via Data Attribution for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946)
*Evelyn Ma,Duo Zhou,Peizhi Niu,Huiting Zhou,Huan Zhang,Olgica Milenkovic,S. Rasoul Etesami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) faces challenges such as unintended forgetting. This paper proposes GUARD, a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention and significantly enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns, unlearning in LLMs is becoming increasingly important. However, there exists a challenge of unintended forgetting which impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable information.

Method: The paper introduces GUARD, which includes a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning and a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples. The method quantifies the 'alignment' between the forget and retain sets and reallocates unlearning power to mitigate unintended losses in retention.

Result: Extensive experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to 194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

Conclusion: GUARD provides rigorous theoretical guarantees that it significantly enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

*Boaz Lavon,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), a novel method that integrates real-time execution signals into the code generation process of neural models, improving performance in diverse coding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of large language models not utilizing execution feedback during inference, which is a critical signal used by human programmers.

Method: EG-CFG dynamically incorporates execution signals as the model generates code using a multi-stage process including beam search for candidate program completions, extracting execution signals by running test cases, and incorporating these signals into the prompt during generation.

Result: Experiments show that EG-CFG significantly enhances code generation performance compared to standard methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in various coding tasks from basic to advanced levels.

Conclusion: EG-CFG effectively leverages execution feedback to improve neural code generation, demonstrating superior performance across different coding challenges.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation
capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during
inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our
method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically
incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and

### [111] [Build the web for agents, not agents for the web](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10953)
*Xing Han Lù,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This position paper highlights the challenges current web agents face due to the mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities, proposing a paradigm shift towards Agentic Web Interfaces (AWI) designed specifically for agents, with six guiding principles emphasizing safety, efficiency, and standardization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agent approaches encounter significant difficulties adapting to human-designed interfaces, struggling with complex web inputs such as DOM trees, screenshots, or API interactions. This necessitates a new perspective on how web agents interact with websites.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of Agentic Web Interfaces (AWI), which are interfaces tailored for agents to navigate websites more effectively. It outlines six guiding principles for AWI design focusing on safety, efficiency, and standardization.

Result: By adopting the proposed AWI paradigm, the development of web agents can overcome limitations of existing interfaces, leading to more efficient, reliable, and transparent designs.

Conclusion: The future of web agent design involves creating interfaces optimized for agent capabilities, requiring collaboration from the broader ML community to achieve this goal.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

### [112] [ReGuidance: A Simple Diffusion Wrapper for Boosting Sample Quality on Hard Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10955)
*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance is a simple wrapper for boosting sample realism and reward in pretrained diffusion models when solving inverse problems. It works by inverting the candidate solution through an unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse and using it as initialization for DPS. This method significantly improves sample quality and measurement consistency in hard inverse problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained diffusion models have been used to solve inverse problems, but current methods may veer off the data manifold and fail to produce realistic outputs when the reward is not informative enough, such as in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio.

Method: The authors propose ReGuidance, which takes a candidate solution produced by any algorithm and inverts it by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting from this solution. The resulting latent is then used as an initialization for DPS.

Result: ReGuidance significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency in hard inverse problems like large box in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling compared to state-of-the-art baselines that visibly fail.

Conclusion: ReGuidance constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS, simultaneously boosting the reward and bringing the candidate solution closer to the data manifold on certain multimodal data distributions.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在流形上进行Hölder函数回归的上下文学习（ICL）理论，建立了注意力机制与经典核方法之间的新联系，并推导出泛化误差界限。当有足够的训练任务时，变压器能够实现Hölder函数在流形上的最小最大回归速率，这取决于流形的内在维度，而非环境空间维度。此外，研究还揭示了泛化误差随训练任务数量的变化规律，为理解几何在ICL中的作用提供了基础性见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管上下文学习（ICL）在自然语言和视觉领域取得了显著成功，但在结构化几何数据方面的理论理解仍然未被探索。

Method: 通过建立注意力机制与经典核方法之间的新联系，研究者推导出了关于提示长度和训练任务数量的泛化误差界限。此方法适用于在流形上进行Hölder函数回归的情境。

Result: 研究表明，当观察到足够数量的训练任务时，变压器可以达到Hölder函数在流形上的最小最大回归速率，该速率随流形的内在维度呈指数变化，而不是环境空间维度。此外，结果还表明泛化误差如何随着训练任务的数量而变化。

Conclusion: 本研究为几何在上下文学习中的作用提供了基础性见解，并提出了研究非线性模型上下文学习的新工具。

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Farseer is a new scaling law that improves on Chinchilla's law by providing more accurate and generalizable predictions for large language model training, reducing extrapolation error by 433% and offering insights into optimal compute allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training large language models is very expensive and small-scale experiment insights often don't transfer well to large-scale production systems. There is a need for better predictive laws to bridge the gap between small and large scale model training.

Method: By constructing a model loss surface L(N,D), Farseer achieves better fit to empirical data than previous laws. The methodology results in accurate, robust, and generalizable predictions with strong extrapolation capabilities.

Result: Farseer reduces extrapolation error by 433% compared to Chinchilla's law, enabling reliable evaluation of training strategies across all (N,D) settings and providing insights into optimal compute allocation.

Conclusion: The extensive validation through training about 1,000 LLMs consuming 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours confirms Farseer's effectiveness. All models, data, results, and logs are being open-sourced to promote further research.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at

*Julius Berner,Miguel Liu-Schiaffini,Jean Kossaifi,Valentin Duruisseaux,Boris Bonev,Kamyar Azizzadenesheli,Anima Anandkumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to convert popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications, aiming to guide practitioners in creating practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the limitation of neural networks in scientific applications due to the fundamental disparities in the nature of data. Neural operators can generalize neural networks to mappings between function spaces, providing a way to solve scientific problems such as PDEs.

Method: The authors identify key principles for constructing practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces and propose a recipe to convert several popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal changes.

Result: The proposed method allows operator learning to enjoy the same empirical optimizations as deep learning, making neural operators work in practice.

Conclusion: This paper provides guidance for practitioners to convert neural architectures into neural operators and details the steps to implement them successfully.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

*Sebastian Sanokowski,Lukas Gruber,Christoph Bartmann,Sepp Hochreiter,Sebastian Lehner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In the field of diffusion bridges, the Log Variance (LV) loss does not perform as well as the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss. The rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) solves conceptual problems and consistently outperforms LV loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to investigate why the Log Variance (LV) loss performs better than the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss in certain cases, but not for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned.

Method: The authors analyze the gradients yielded by the on-policy LV loss and the rKL loss, showing that they are identical only under specific conditions. They argue that the LV loss lacks a solid optimization objective compared to the rKL loss, which can be motivated via the data processing inequality. They then propose using the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) as an alternative.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance on challenging benchmarks, require less hyperparameter optimization, and exhibit more stable training behavior.

Conclusion: The rKL-LD loss outperforms the LV loss both conceptually and practically for diffusion bridges.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

TL;DR: An abstract about a method named RAAI which can jailbreak LLMs and increase harmful response rate, but also improve model robustness when used for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safely aligning large language models often demands extensive human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.

Method: Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward, training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack techniques.

Result: Experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general capabilities.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents MalwareBench, a dataset of 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation to assess LLMs' robustness against such attacks. Experiments reveal mainstream LLMs have limited ability to reject malicious code requirements, with rejection rates dropping further when combined with jailbreak methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the gap in understanding the specific vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to jailbreak attacks in the context of malicious code generation, as prior research has focused on general security capabilities but not specifically on code generation vulnerabilities.

Method: The authors propose MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset consisting of 3,520 jailbreaking prompts designed for malicious code-generation. This dataset is built upon 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements and covers 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. The method involves using this dataset to evaluate the robustness of LLMs against jailbreak attacks.

Result: Experiments indicate that mainstream LLMs have limited capability to reject malicious code-generation requirements. The average rejection rate for malicious content is 60.93%, which decreases to 39.92% when multiple jailbreak methods are combined with attack algorithms.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this study is that the code security capabilities of LLMs remain inadequate and pose significant challenges, emphasizing the need for further advancements in enhancing the robustness of LLMs against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes Private Memorization Editing (PME), a method that uses the memorization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to prevent private data leakage. It edits the model's knowledge of training data to mitigate the memorization of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) without affecting the underlying language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of LLMs potentially memorizing and leaking Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from uncontrolled training data.

Method: The method involves detecting memorized PII and editing the model's knowledge of its training data to reduce the memorization of PII.

Result: The procedure effectively reduces the number of leaked PII in various configurations, sometimes reducing the accuracy of privacy attacks to zero, without affecting the underlying language model.

Conclusion: Private Memorization Editing can successfully turn LLMs' memorization ability into a privacy defense strategy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

Result: Identified perceived risks by SMB decision-makers, reasons for defense measures choice, impact factors on security perception, and relationship between awareness and business attributes.

Conclusion: Proposed interventions to help SMBs overcome challenges related to cybersecurity awareness.

Abstract: Key decision-makers in small and medium businesses (SMBs) often lack the
awareness and knowledge to implement cybersecurity measures effectively. To
gain a deeper understanding of how SMB executives navigate cybersecurity
decision-making, we deployed a mixed-method approach, conducting
semi-structured interviews (n=21) and online surveys (n=322) with SMB key
decision-makers. Using thematic analysis, we revealed SMB decision-makers'
perceived risks in terms of the digital assets they valued, and found reasons
for their choice of defense measures and factors impacting security perception.
We employed the situational awareness model to characterize decision-makers
based on cybersecurity awareness, identifying those who have comparatively low
awareness in the fight against adversaries. We further explored the
relationship between awareness and business attributes, and constructed a
holistic structural equation model to understand how awareness can be improved.
Finally, we proposed interventions to help SMBs overcome potential challenges.

TL;DR: Cloud computing faces security challenges with the advent of quantum computers. This paper proposes using quantum cryptography, specifically Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) via the BB84 protocol and Quantum One Time Pad (QOTP), to secure data in cloud environments against future threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is the increasing threat to data security posed by the potential development of powerful quantum computers, which could undermine traditional encryption methods.

Method: The method involves applying quantum cryptography techniques such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using the BB84 protocol to generate secure keys and Quantum One Time Pad (QOTP) for encrypting and decrypting data in cloud systems.

Result: The result is a robust defense mechanism that protects cloud-stored or shared data from attacks even if adversaries possess quantum computers.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper demonstrates that integrating QKD, BB84, and QOTP into cloud systems provides strong and reliable data security measures, ensuring safety both presently and in the age of quantum computing.

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented

copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

Method: Using powers of 2 and 3 combined with modular inversion in Z/3^pZ to create a parametric identity with residue constraints that yield abc-triples with low radical values. Then applying affine transformations to embed these triples into a broader space optimised for the ratio log c / log rad(abc).

Result: Emergence of structured, radical-minimising candidates, including both known and novel abc-triples.

Conclusion: This method provides a symbolic and algebraic framework for controlled triple generation, with potential implications for symbolic entropy filtering in cryptographic pre-processing.

Abstract: We present a symbolic identity for generating integer triples $(a, b, c)$
satisfying $a + b = c$, inspired by structural features of the \emph{abc
conjecture}. The construction uses powers of $2$ and $3$ in combination with
modular inversion in $\mathbb{Z}/3^p\mathbb{Z}$, leading to a parametric
identity with residue constraints that yield abc-triples exhibiting low radical
values. Through affine transformations, these symbolic triples are embedded
into a broader space of high-quality examples, optimised for the ratio $\log c
/ \log \operatorname{rad}(abc)$. Computational results demonstrate the
emergence of structured, radical-minimising candidates, including both known
and novel triples. These methods provide a symbolic and algebraic framework for
controlled triple generation, and suggest exploratory implications for symbolic
entropy filtering in cryptographic pre-processing.

### [126] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenBreak, a framework that fine-tunes a red-team LLM to systematically explore vulnerabilities in T2I generators by crafting adversarial prompts that enhance evasion and image toxicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety of defended T2I models due to limitations in current research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against these models.

Method: Propose GenBreak framework which fine-tunes a red-team LLM using supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets and reinforcement learning via interaction with a surrogate T2I model. It integrates multiple reward signals to guide the LLM to craft adversarial prompts.

Result: The crafted prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety weaknesses.

Conclusion: GenBreak reveals significant safety risks in commercial T2I generators and provides a systematic approach to evaluate and improve their safety.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The study investigates using LLMs for software vulnerability assessment in Python code with known CWEs, comparing different prompting strategies. Few-shot prompting outperforms zero-shot, and integrating confidence-based routing improves efficiency. LLMs can generalize across vulnerability categories but challenges remain in reliability, interpretability, and adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, there is a need for rapid and accurate vulnerability detection to maintain secure systems. The motivation is to explore the potential of LLMs in enhancing vulnerability assessment processes.

Method: The study simulates the identification of Python code with known CWEs using LLMs and compares three prompting strategies: zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot in-domain. It also integrates confidence-based routing strategies to optimize the balance between automation and expert oversight.

Result: Zero-shot prompting performs poorly, while few-shot prompting significantly enhances classification performance. LLMs can effectively generalize across vulnerability categories with minimal examples, showing potential as scalable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential in AI-assisted vulnerability detection systems when integrated with EITL decision-making. This approach can enhance operational resilience and reduce the burden on human analysts, though challenges in model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial robustness remain.

Abstract: As cyber threats become more sophisticated, rapid and accurate vulnerability
detection is essential for maintaining secure systems. This study explores the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by
simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness
Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot
in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot
prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances
classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based
routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases
where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and
expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across
vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as
scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However,
challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial
robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven
approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights
a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our
findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection
systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational
resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.

### [128] [D-LiFT: Improving LLM-based Decompiler Backend via Code Quality-driven Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10125)
*Muqi Zou,Hongyu Cai,Hongwei Wu,Zion Leonahenahe Basque,Arslan Khan,Berkay Celik,Dave,Tian,Antonio Bianchi,Ruoyu,Wang,Dongyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: D-LiFT is a decompiler backend that uses LLMs and reinforcement learning to improve the quality of decompiled code while preserving accuracy. It introduces D-SCORE, an assessment system that evaluates decompiled code for correctness and readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decompiler output often contains syntactic and semantic errors and is difficult to read. Existing approaches using LLMs have limitations such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.

Method: D-LiFT harnesses and further trains LLMs via reinforcement learning. It uses D-SCORE, a quality assessment system, which first verifies syntactic and semantic correctness through a compiler and symbolic execution, then evaluates readability using established metrics if the accuracy check is passed.

Result: D-LiFT significantly improves the accurate decompiled code from projects coreutils and util-linux. Compared to baseline LLMs, it produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions as measured by D-SCORE.

Conclusion: D-LiFT enhances decompiled code quality by preserving accuracy while improving readability, demonstrating significant improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary
executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances,
their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains
difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),
researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.
Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,
such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.
In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that
harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving
accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of
decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.
Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system
to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,
D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher
scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,
D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler
and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then
evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with
the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for
fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,
demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the
coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without
D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled
functions, as measured by D-SCORE.

*Lucas Truax,Sandip Roy,Laszlo B. Kish*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces KLJN as a new method for securing satellite communications, offering simplicity, cost-efficiency, and resilience compared to QKD. It concludes that KLJN is a practical choice for secure communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative approach to securing satellite communications that is simpler, more cost-effective, and resilient compared to quantum key distribution (QKD).

Method: KLJN uses standard electronic components and wires based on classical physics principles, providing unconditional security impervious to environmental noise and radiation.

Result: KLJN provides significant advantages in terms of simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making it suitable for secure satellite communications.

Conclusion: KLJN is a practical and revolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient satellite communications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) as an
approach to securing satellite communications. KLJN has the potential to
revolutionize satellite communication security through its combination of
simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and resilience with unconditional security.
Unlike quantum key distribution (QKD), which requires complex, fragile, and
expensive infrastructure like photon detectors and dedicated optical links,
KLJN operates using standard electronic components and wires, significantly
reducing implementation costs and logistical hurdles. KLJN's security, grounded
in the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental
and radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions
of satellite communications. This robustness, coupled with its ability to
integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, positions KLJN as a
revolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient
satellite communications. The authors explore the value of achieving
unconditionally secure communications in strategic ground-to-satellite networks
which address vulnerabilities posed by advanced computational threats,
including quantum computing. Our team has examined two leading approaches to
unconditional security - the KLJN scheme and QKD - and analyzed the potential
use of each for space systems. While QKD leverages quantum mechanics for
security, it faces challenges related to cost, complexity, and environmental
sensitivity. In contrast, the KLJN scheme utilizes classical physics principles
to provide a simpler, more cost-effective, and resilient alternative,
particularly for ground-based systems. The study concludes that KLJN offers
significant advantages in simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making
it a practical choice for many secure communication applications.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型代理在个人助手、客服机器人和临床辅助等方面得到了应用，但它们需要持续访问敏感数据，增加了未经授权披露的可能性。本文提出了一种对话隐私审计框架CMPL，通过多轮交互系统地揭示潜在漏洞，并提供了基于可量化风险指标的审计程序和开放基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型代理带来了巨大的运营优势，但它们对敏感数据的持续访问增加了隐私泄露的风险，因此需要一种方法来量化和审计这些风险。

Method: 提出了一种名为CMPL（对话隐私泄露操纵）的迭代探测策略，模拟多轮现实交互以测试严格隐私指令下的代理，而非仅仅关注单一披露事件。

Result: 在不同领域、数据模式和安全配置上的评估表明，该框架能够揭示现有单轮防御无法阻止的隐私风险。

Conclusion: 本文引入了CMPL作为一种诊断工具，并提供了一个基于可量化风险指标的审计程序和一个开放基准，用于评估各种代理实现中的对话隐私。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AURA is a multi-agent framework for automated APT attribution using threat data and LLMs, showing high consistency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective APT attribution requires correlating behavioral patterns and reasoning over complex threat intelligence artifacts.

Method: AURA ingests diverse threat data and processes it through collaborative agents designed for query rewriting, retrieval, and justification using RAG and LLMs.

Result: Experiments on recent APT campaigns demonstrate AURA's high attribution consistency, expert-aligned justifications, and scalability.

Conclusion: AURA establishes a promising direction for transparent, data-driven, and scalable threat attribution using multi-agent intelligence.

Abstract: Effective attribution of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) increasingly
hinges on the ability to correlate behavioral patterns and reason over complex,
varied threat intelligence artifacts. We present AURA (Attribution Using
Retrieval-Augmented Agents), a multi-agent, knowledge-enhanced framework for
automated and interpretable APT attribution. AURA ingests diverse threat data
including Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), Indicators of Compromise
(IoCs), malware details, adversarial tools, and temporal information, which are
processed through a network of collaborative agents. These agents are designed
for intelligent query rewriting, context-enriched retrieval from structured
threat knowledge bases, and natural language justification of attribution
decisions. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large
Language Models (LLMs), AURA enables contextual linking of threat behaviors to
known APT groups and supports traceable reasoning across multiple attack
phases. Experiments on recent APT campaigns demonstrate AURA's high attribution
consistency, expert-aligned justifications, and scalability. This work
establishes AURA as a promising direction for advancing transparent,
data-driven, and scalable threat attribution using multi-agent intelligence.

*Marius Mehrl,Mila Pfander,Theresa Winner,Cornelius Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Secret police are used by autocrats to maintain power, but they aren't present in all autocracies. This paper explores the conditions under which secret police emerge in dictatorships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which secret police emerge in dictatorships.

Method: Applied statistical variable selection techniques to identify explanatory variables from the literature on state security forces and authoritarian survival.

Result: Secret police are more likely to emerge when rulers face specific threats like protests and have the material resources to establish these organizations.

Conclusion: This research enhances our understanding of autocrats' institutional choices and authoritarian politics.

Abstract: Autocrats use secret police to stay in power, as these organizations deter
and suppress opposition to their rule. Existing research shows that secret
police are very good at this but, surprisingly, also that they are not as
ubiquitous in autocracies as one may assume, existing in less than 50% of
autocratic country-years. We thus explore under which conditions secret police
emerge in dictatorships. For this purpose, we apply statistical variable
selection techniques to identify which of several candidate variables extracted
from the literature on state security forces and authoritarian survival hold
explanatory power. Our results highlight that secret police are more likely to
emerge when rulers face specific, preempt-able threats, such as protests and
anti-system mobilisation, but also when they have the material resources to
establish these organisations. This research contributes to our understanding
of autocrats' institutional choices and authoritarian politics.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerability of machine unlearning methods to prompt attacks, evaluates eight techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis, and reveals that while some methods like RMU and TAR are robust, others such as ELM remain susceptible. Logit analysis shows unlearned models do not hide knowledge by changing answer formats. The authors challenge current assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and provide a public evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness of various machine unlearning methods under prompt attacks and determine if supposedly unlearned knowledge can be retrieved through different analyses.

Method: Systematically evaluate eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis. Subject these methods to straightforward prompt attacks and analyze their performance in terms of retrieving supposedly unlearned knowledge.

Result: Methods like RMU and TAR demonstrate robust unlearning against prompt attacks, whereas ELM remains vulnerable (e.g., Hindi filler text recovering 57.3% accuracy). Logit analysis confirms that unlearned models generally do not hide knowledge by modifying answer formats.

Conclusion: Current assumptions about the effectiveness of unlearning methods may be challenged. There is a need for reliable evaluation frameworks to distinguish between true knowledge removal and superficial output suppression.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

TL;DR: ELFuzz 是一种基于大型语言模型的生成式模糊测试方法，能够自动生成高效的模糊测试器，显著提升代码覆盖率和漏洞检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式模糊测试需要大量手动构建输入规范的工作量，因此研究自动合成高效模糊测试器的方法是重要的研究方向。

Method: 通过最小种子模糊测试器起步，利用大型语言模型驱动进化，并结合覆盖指导来自动合成适合被测系统的模糊测试器。

Result: 相比人工编写的规范和现有方法，ELFuzz 提升了高达 434.8% 的代码覆盖率，并触发多达 174.0% 的人工注入漏洞；在实际 fuzzing 活动中发现了五个 0-day 漏洞，其中三个可被利用。

Conclusion: ELFuzz 展现了在自动化、效率和可扩展性方面的巨大潜力，为更智能的输入生成提供了新途径。

Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to
specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and
software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to
construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large
Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based
fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over
fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels
the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.
Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of
real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)
synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and
semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared
ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized
by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more
coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also
used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of
cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are
exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the
fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to
62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers
synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical
structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results
present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and
extensible input generation for fuzzing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) across various sectors has led to an increased focus on examining security vulnerabilities within these systems.

Method: The authors conduct a comprehensive survey summarizing cybersecurity vulnerabilities during different phases of UAV deployment, analyzing the likelihood and impact of each vulnerability, and exploring both UAS-specific and non-UAS-specific mitigation strategies. Relevant cybersecurity standards are also presented.

Result: The analysis identifies several critical research gaps in UAS security that require further investigation.

Conclusion: While significant literature exists on UAS security, there are still critical areas needing exploration. The authors provide discussions and recommendations for future research in this domain.

Abstract: In the last decade, the rapid growth of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and
Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) in communication, defense, and transportation
has increased. The application of UAS will continue to increase rapidly. This
has led researchers to examine security vulnerabilities in various facets of
UAS infrastructure and UAVs, which form a part of the UAS system to reinforce
these critical systems. This survey summarizes the cybersecurity
vulnerabilities in several phases of UAV deployment, the likelihood of each
vulnerability's occurrence, the impact of attacks, and mitigation strategies
that could be applied. We go beyond the state-of-the-art by taking a
comprehensive approach to enhancing UAS security by performing an analysis of
both UAS-specific and non-UAS-specific mitigation strategies that are
applicable within the UAS domain to define the lessons learned. We also present
relevant cybersecurity standards and their recommendations in the UAS context.
Despite the significant literature in UAS security and the relevance of
cyberphysical and networked systems security approaches from the past, which we
identify in the survey, we find several critical research gaps that require
further investigation. These form part of our discussions and recommendations
for the future exploration by our research community.

### [136] [Adaptive Chosen-Ciphertext Security of Distributed Broadcast Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10338)
*Kwangsu Lee*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient Distributed Broadcast Encryption (DBE) scheme that achieves adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) security for the first time, with constant size ciphertexts and private keys, linear size public keys, and a constant number of pairing operations for public key verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DBE schemes have proven security in the adaptive chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) model but are inefficient due to the requirement of linear number of pairing operations when verifying user public keys. There is a need for a more efficient DBE scheme with stronger security guarantees.

Method: The authors first propose a semi-static CCA secure DBE scheme and prove its security under the $q$-Type assumption. They then modify the generic transformation of Gentry and Waters to convert this semi-static CCA secure DBE scheme into an adaptive CCA secure DBE scheme, proving its adaptive CCA security.

Result: The proposed DBE scheme achieves adaptive CCA security, requiring constant size ciphertexts and private keys, linear size public keys, and only a constant number of pairing operations for public key verification. This represents a significant improvement in efficiency compared to previous schemes.

Conclusion: The paper successfully constructs an efficient DBE scheme that achieves adaptive CCA security for the first time. The scheme offers improvements in both security and efficiency, making it a valuable contribution to the field of broadcast encryption.

Abstract: Distributed broadcast encryption (DBE) is a specific kind of broadcast
encryption (BE) where users independently generate their own public and private
keys, and a sender can efficiently create a ciphertext for a subset of users by
using the public keys of the subset users. Previously proposed DBE schemes have
been proven in the adaptive chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security model and
have the disadvantage of requiring linear number of pairing operations when
verifying the public key of a user. In this paper, we propose an efficient DBE
scheme in bilinear groups and prove adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA)
security for the first time. To do this, we first propose a semi-static CCA
secure DBE scheme and prove the security under the $q$-Type assumption. Then,
by modifying the generic transformation of Gentry and Waters that converts a
semi-static CPA secure DBE scheme into an adaptive CPA secure DBE scheme to be
applied to CCA secure DBE schemes, we propose an adaptive CCA secure DBE scheme
and prove its adaptive CCA security. Our proposed DBE scheme is efficient
because it requires constant size ciphertexts, constant size private keys, and
linear size public keys, and the public key verification requires only a
constant number of pairing operations and efficient group membership checks.

*Zhaoxuan Kan,Husheng Han,Shangyi Shi,Tenghui Hua,Hang Lu,Xiaowei Li,Jianan Mu,Xing Hu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FicGCN is a HE-based framework designed to leverage the sparse characteristics of GCNs and balance aggregation and combination operations. It uses a latency-aware packing scheme, SpIntra-CA method, and region-based data reordering. Results show FicGCN outperforms current designs up to 4.10x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper stems from the increasing demand for cloud-based GCN services and the associated privacy concerns over sensitive graph data. Existing HE solutions introduce significant computational overhead, especially for GCN operations that require rotations and multiplications in matrix products. The sparsity of GCNs presents an opportunity to improve performance, but irregularities complicate practical gains.

Method: The proposed method, FicGCN, employs three key techniques: a latency-aware packing scheme to optimize data arrangement for efficient computation, a Sparse Intra-Ciphertext Aggregation (SpIntra-CA) method to minimize rotation overhead by leveraging the sparse nature of GCNs, and a region-based data reordering strategy driven by local adjacency structure to enhance performance.

Result: FicGCN was evaluated on several popular datasets and demonstrated superior performance across all tested datasets, achieving up to a 4.10x improvement compared to the latest design.

Conclusion: FicGCN successfully harnesses the sparse characteristics of GCNs and achieves a globally optimal balance between aggregation and combination operations through its innovative techniques. This results in significantly improved performance for privacy-preserving GCN computations.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) have gained widespread popularity
in various fields like personal healthcare and financial systems, due to their
remarkable performance. Despite the growing demand for cloud-based GCN
services, privacy concerns over sensitive graph data remain significant.
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) facilitates Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
(PPML) by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data. However, HE
introduces substantial computational overhead, particularly for GCN operations
that require rotations and multiplications in matrix products. The sparsity of
GCNs offers significant performance potential, but their irregularity
introduces additional operations that reduce practical gains. In this paper, we
propose FicGCN, a HE-based framework specifically designed to harness the
sparse characteristics of GCNs and strike a globally optimal balance between
aggregation and combination operations. FicGCN employs a latency-aware packing
scheme, a Sparse Intra-Ciphertext Aggregation (SpIntra-CA) method to minimize
rotation overhead, and a region-based data reordering driven by local adjacency
structure. We evaluated FicGCN on several popular datasets, and the results
show that FicGCN achieved the best performance across all tested datasets, with

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

*Felix Härer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in LLMs suggest potential for novel applications. This paper reports exploratory research results to specify and evaluate aspects of multi-agent LLM systems through a multi-agent system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application is not explored well.

Method: The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems.

Result: Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. The results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Conclusion: Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for specific applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.
However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques,
and applications individually, their joint specification and combined
application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM
systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for
specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning
techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory
research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system.
The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a
specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving
cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation
approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering,
server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by
agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

### [140] [A Crack in the Bark: Leveraging Public Knowledge to Remove Tree-Ring Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10502)
*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new attack method targeting the Tree-Ring watermarking technique for diffusion models, which only needs access to the variational autoencoder. This approach significantly reduces the effectiveness of the Tree-Ring detector while maintaining high image quality. The findings indicate risks in reusing public autoencoders and deficiencies in the Tree-Ring detector's precision for practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the vulnerability of the Tree-Ring watermarking technique when public components like variational autoencoders are reused in training diffusion models, and to highlight overlooked aspects such as detector precision.

Method: Develop an attack that uses the publicly available variational autoencoder to approximate the model's latent space, enabling surrogate-based attacks without requiring full access to the diffusion model.

Result: The attack drastically reduced the Tree-Ring detector's AUC from 0.993 to 0.153 in ROC curves and from 0.994 to 0.385 in PR curves, showing superior performance compared to existing methods assuming full model access, while preserving high image quality.

Conclusion: Reusing public autoencoders poses security risks for diffusion models, and the Tree-Ring detector's precision is insufficient for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然取得了显著进展，但在部署中暴露出对越狱攻击的关键漏洞，而现有的防护栏解决方案缺乏统一的分类和评估标准。

Method: 作者提出了一种新的多维度分类法，将防护栏分为六个关键维度，并引入了安全性-效率-效用评估框架来衡量其实用效果。通过广泛的分析和实验，识别出现有防护栏的优势与局限性。

Conclusion: 本工作为未来的研究和开发提供了指导原则，旨在推动强大且稳健的大语言模型防护栏的设计与部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

### [142] [Assessing the Resilience of Automotive Intrusion Detection Systems to Adversarial Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10620)
*Stefano Longari,Paolo Cerracchio,Michele Carminati,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本研究扩展了之前的工作，探讨了基于梯度的对抗性攻击在不同知识程度下对汽车入侵检测系统（IDS）的影响，并评估了其在现代车辆CAN总线环境中的实时可行性及有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现代车辆连接性的增加和CAN总线缺乏强大的安全措施，车辆容易受到网络攻击。尽管已有入侵检测系统（IDS），但它们可能被对抗性攻击（特别是逃避攻击）所绕过，这促使研究者探索针对汽车IDS的对抗性攻击的可行性和影响。

Method: 研究考虑了三种攻击场景：白盒（攻击者拥有完全系统知识）、灰盒（部分系统知识）和更现实的黑盒（无关于IDS内部工作或数据的知识）。通过使用公开数据集评估最新IDS对所提攻击的有效性，同时研究对抗性扰动对攻击效果的影响，并通过预先计算逃逸负载以基于总线流量进行定时注入来评估实时可行性。

Result: 结果显示，由于汽车领域的限制，发起攻击具有挑战性，其有效性高度依赖于数据集质量、目标IDS以及攻击者的知识程度。

Conclusion: 对抗性攻击在汽车领域中实施难度较大，其效果受多种因素影响，包括数据集质量、目标检测系统特性和攻击者知识水平。这表明需要进一步改进IDS以应对潜在的对抗性攻击。

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

*Stefano Longari,Alessandro Pozone,Jessica Leoni,Mario Polino,Michele Carminati,Mara Tanelli,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors propose CyFence, a new architecture that enhances the resilience of closed-loop control systems in Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) against cyber-attacks by incorporating a semantic check secured via Trusted Execution Environment. The evaluation on a real-world active braking controller demonstrates its effectiveness with minimal computation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in the increasing connectivity and exposure of Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) to cyber-attacks, which poses high risks and potential safety harms to safety-critical systems. Existing defense strategies rarely utilize the inherent cyber-physical nature of these systems.

Method: The authors propose CyFence, a novel architecture that adds a semantic check to confirm the expected behavior of CPSs. To secure the semantic check code, they leverage the Trusted Execution Environment implemented by modern processors.

Result: CyFence is evaluated using a real-world application - an active braking digital controller. The results show that it can effectively mitigate various types of attacks while introducing negligible computation overhead.

Conclusion: CyFence successfully exploits the cyber-physical nature of CPSs and improves the resilience of closed-loop control systems against cyber-attacks with minimal impact on performance.

Abstract: In the last decades, Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) have experienced a
significant technological evolution and increased connectivity, at the cost of
greater exposure to cyber-attacks. Since many CPS are used in safety-critical
systems, such attacks entail high risks and potential safety harms. Although
several defense strategies have been proposed, they rarely exploit the
cyber-physical nature of the system. In this work, we exploit the nature of CPS
by proposing CyFence, a novel architecture that improves the resilience of
closed-loop control systems against cyber-attacks by adding a semantic check,
used to confirm that the system is behaving as expected. To ensure the security
of the semantic check code, we use the Trusted Execution Environment
implemented by modern processors. We evaluate CyFence considering a real-world
application, consisting of an active braking digital controller, demonstrating
that it can mitigate different types of attacks with a negligible computation
overhead.

*Aakanksha Saha,Martina Lindorfer,Juan Caballero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 尽管行为配置文件被广泛认为可用于替代IOCs进行威胁归因，但我们的研究表明，仅有34%的威胁组在MITRE ATT&CK中有特定于组的技术，而即使结合多个数据源和额外信息，仍有64%的组没有任何特定于组的行为。这引发了对行为配置文件能否真正取代IOCs进行威胁归因的质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络威胁检测与归因从易变的IOC转向更持久的行为特征（如TTPs和软件），然而这些行为特征的独特性和完整性尚未被深入研究。

Method: 1. 分析MITRE ATT&CK和Malpedia两个开放CTI知识库中的威胁组行为特征。2. 检查有多少威胁组具有组特异性行为。3. 评估结合两个数据源后，组配置文件的改善情况。4. 添加被利用漏洞和附加技术以增强配置文件并重新评估。

Result: 1. 在MITRE ATT&CK中，只有34%的威胁组有组特异性技术，73%使用组特异性软件。2. 在Malpedia数据集中，这一比例降至24%。3. 结合两个数据源后，覆盖率有所提高，但组特异性行为的比例仍低于30%。4. 即使添加了更多数据，仍有64%的组没有任何组特异性行为。

Conclusion: 行为配置文件的独特性不足以完全替代IOCs用于威胁组归因。

Abstract: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domain
names are commonly used for threat detection and attribution. However, IOCs
tend to be short-lived as they are easy to change. As a result, the
cybersecurity community is shifting focus towards more persistent behavioral
profiles, such as the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and the
software used by a threat group. However, the distinctiveness and completeness
of such behavioral profiles remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
systematically analyze threat group profiles built from two open cyber threat
intelligence (CTI) knowledge bases: MITRE ATT&CK and Malpedia. We first
investigate what fraction of threat groups have group-specific behaviors, i.e.,
behaviors used exclusively by a single group. We find that only 34% of threat
groups in ATT&CK have group-specific techniques. The software used by a threat
group proves to be more distinctive, with 73% of ATT&CK groups using
group-specific software. However, this percentage drops to 24% in the broader
Malpedia dataset. Next, we evaluate how group profiles improve when data from
both sources are combined. While coverage improves modestly, the proportion of
groups with group-specific behaviors remains under 30%. We then enhance
profiles by adding exploited vulnerabilities and additional techniques
extracted from more threat reports. Despite the additional information, 64% of
groups still lack any group-specific behavior. Our findings raise concerns on
the belief that behavioral profiles can replace IOCs in threat group
attribution.

*Davide Maffiola,Stefano Longari,Michele Carminati,Mara Tanelli,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes GOLIATH, a blockchain-based decentralized framework for collecting real-time traffic information through In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) systems to overcome the limitations of current centralized crowd-sourcing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art solutions for crowd-sourcing traffic information follow a centralized model which presents single points of failure and trust.

Method: The proposed method is a blockchain-based decentralized framework named GOLIATH that operates on the IVI system. Vehicles in the network share their positions and neighbors' positions as transactions recorded on the ledger using a novel consensus mechanism designed to be resilient against adversaries.

Result: The framework has been evaluated in a simulated environment considering different threats, demonstrating its robustness and safety properties.

Conclusion: GOLIATH mitigates the limitations of existing centralized solutions by ensuring trusted information collection and exchange, leveraging the distributed nature of vehicles.

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) technology has advanced during the
past years, and it is now used for several applications that require vehicles
to exchange real-time data, such as in traffic information management.
Traditionally, road traffic information has been collected using on-site
sensors. However, crowd-sourcing traffic information from onboard sensors or
smartphones has become a viable alternative. State-of-the-art solutions
currently follow a centralized model where only the service provider has
complete access to the collected traffic data and represent a single point of
failure and trust. In this paper, we propose GOLIATH, a blockchain-based
decentralized framework that runs on the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system
to collect real-time information exchanged between the network's participants.
Our approach mitigates the limitations of existing crowd-sourcing centralized
solutions by guaranteeing trusted information collection and exchange, fully
exploiting the intrinsic distributed nature of vehicles. We demonstrate its
feasibility in the context of vehicle positioning and traffic information
management. Each vehicle participating in the decentralized network shares its
position and neighbors' ones in the form of a transaction recorded on the
ledger, which uses a novel consensus mechanism to validate it. We design the
consensus mechanism resilient against a realistic set of adversaries that aim
to tamper or disable the communication. We evaluate the proposed framework in a
simulated (but realistic) environment, which considers different threats and
allows showing its robustness and safety properties.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the relationship between Commitment Schemes (CSs) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols, focusing on their properties and how they affect MPC security. It also acts as a tutorial for understanding the interaction between CS and MPC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of exploration into the interrelation between Commitment Schemes and Multi-Party Computation protocols, especially in terms of their properties and practical applications.

Method: The paper analyzes different types of Commitment Schemes and their contributions to various MPC constructions, examining their properties and impact on MPC security.

Result: The analysis reveals the importance of selecting appropriate Commitment Schemes to meet adversarial and functional requirements of MPC protocols, enhancing robustness and privacy.

Conclusion: Careful selection of Commitment Schemes is crucial for developing more secure and privacy-preserving cryptographic applications using Multi-Party Computation.

Abstract: The paper presents an analysis of Commitment Schemes (CSs) used in
Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols. While the individual properties of CSs
and the guarantees offered by MPC have been widely studied in isolation, their
interrelation in concrete protocols and applications remains mostly
underexplored. This paper presents the relation between the two, with an
emphasis on (security) properties and their impact on the upper layer MPC. In
particular, we investigate how different types of CSs contribute to various MPC
constructions and their relation to real-life applications of MPC. The paper
can also serve as a tutorial for understanding the cryptographic interplay
between CS and MPC, making it accessible to both researchers and practitioners.
Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully selecting CS to meet the
adversarial and functional requirements of MPC, thereby aiming for more robust
and privacy-preserving cryptographic applications

*Xiaoxing Mo,Yuxuan Cheng,Nan Sun,Leo Yu Zhang,Wei Luo,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, which can manipulate model behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) is effective for detecting such attacks but has limitations. This paper introduces TED-LaST, an advanced defense mechanism that improves TED's robustness against adaptive backdoor attacks by incorporating label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis. Experiments on multiple datasets and architectures demonstrate TED-LaST's effectiveness in countering sophisticated backdoors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper stems from the vulnerability of DNNs to backdoor attacks and the limitations of current detection methods like TED when facing adaptive attacks that distort topological representation distributions.

Method: TED-LaST introduces two key innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis. It also reviews and classifies data poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and proposes an enhanced adaptive attack with target mapping to fully leverage the stealthiness of these attacks.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on various datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST effectively detects and counteracts sophisticated backdoor attacks, including Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch, and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack.

Conclusion: TED-LaST sets a new benchmark in robust backdoor detection, significantly improving DNN security against evolving threats.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

*Xiaobei Yan,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ObfusBFA is a methodology that introduces random dummy operations during model inference to transform bit-flip attacks into random bit flips, making it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerable bits. It effectively defends against various types of bit-flip attacks while maintaining model accuracy and introducing minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bit-flip attacks pose a significant threat to DNNs by degrading model accuracy or misleading predictions through flipping a small number of bits in model parameters or binary code. Existing defenses are limited to specific attacks and platforms, lacking effectiveness in other scenarios.

Method: ObfusBFA introduces random dummy operations during model inference, which converts precise bit-flip attacks into random ones. Novel algorithms are designed to identify critical bits and insert obfuscation operations, protecting both high-level model weights and low-level codebase.

Result: ObfusBFA consistently preserves model accuracy across different datasets and DNN architectures while significantly reducing attack success rates. It also introduces minimal latency and storage overhead, proving practical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: ObfusBFA provides an efficient and holistic solution to mitigate bit-flip attacks targeting both high-level model weights and low-level codebase, with proven effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Bit-flip attacks (BFAs) represent a serious threat to Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs), where flipping a small number of bits in the model parameters or binary
code can significantly degrade the model accuracy or mislead the model
prediction in a desired way. Existing defenses exclusively focus on protecting
models for specific attacks and platforms, while lacking effectiveness for
other scenarios. We propose ObfusBFA, an efficient and holistic methodology to
mitigate BFAs targeting both the high-level model weights and low-level
codebase (executables or shared libraries). The key idea of ObfusBFA is to
introduce random dummy operations during the model inference, which effectively
transforms the delicate attacks into random bit flips, making it much harder
for attackers to pinpoint and exploit vulnerable bits. We design novel
algorithms to identify critical bits and insert obfuscation operations. We
evaluate ObfusBFA against different types of attacks, including the adaptive
scenarios where the attacker increases the flip bit budget to attempt to
circumvent our defense. The results show that ObfusBFA can consistently
preserve the model accuracy across various datasets and DNN architectures while
significantly reducing the attack success rates. Additionally, it introduces
minimal latency and storage overhead, making it a practical solution for
real-world applications.

*Christophe Parisel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Belshazaar is a two-stage framework that addresses the effective permission set problem and evaluates wildcard permissions spread in Azure RBAC. It formalizes Azure action syntax via a context free grammar, expands wildcards into explicit action sets, and defines an ultrametric diameter metric to quantify semantic overreach. When applied to Microsoft's official catalog of 15481 actions, it reveals that about 39 percent of actions admit cross Resource Provider reach when associated with non-obvious wildcards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Azure RBAC leverages wildcard permissions which can obscure the actual set of allowed operations and undermine least-privilege guarantees.

Method: First, Belshazaar formalizes Azure action syntax via a context free grammar and implements a compiler that expands any wildcard into its explicit action set. Second, it defines an ultrametric diameter metric to quantify semantic overreach in wildcard scenarios.

Result: Belshazaar reveals that about 39 percent of actions admit cross Resource Provider reach when associated with non-obvious wildcards, and that effective permissions sets are effectively computable.

Conclusion: Wildcard patterns can introduce substantial privilege bloat, but Belshazaar offers a scalable, semantics driven path toward tighter, least-privilege RBAC policies in Azure environments.

Abstract: Azure RBAC leverages wildcard permissions to simplify policy authoring, but
this abstraction often obscures the actual set of allowed operations and
undermines least-privilege guarantees. We introduce Belshazaar, a two-stage
framework that targets both the effective permission set problem and the
evaluation of wildcards permissions spread. First, we formalize Azure action
syntax via a context free grammar and implement a compiler that expands any
wildcard into its explicit action set. Second, we define an ultrametric
diameter metric to quantify semantic overreach in wildcard scenarios. Applied
to Microsoft s official catalog of 15481 actions, Belshazaar reveals that about
39 percent of actions admit a cross Resource Provider reach when associated
with non obvious wildcards, and that effective permissions sets are effectively
computable. These findings demonstrate that wildcard patterns can introduce
substantial privilege bloat, and that our approach offers a scalable, semantics
driven path toward tighter, least-privilege RBAC policies in Azure

### [150] [ME: Trigger Element Combination Backdoor Attack on Copyright Infringement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10776)
*Feiyu Yang,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of copyright infringement attacks on generative diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. It highlights the limitations of current datasets for such attacks and proposes new datasets along with an enhanced attack method called Multi-Element (ME) which builds on SilentBadDiffusion (SBD). The ME method increases the number of poisonous visual-text elements per sample and uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to maintain stealthiness. The results show improvements over SBD, especially in scenarios with low subsampling ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need to explore and improve methods for copyright infringement attacks on text-to-image generative models, given the constraints and limitations of existing datasets and the suboptimal performance of state-of-the-art attacking methods like SBD when few poisoning samples are available.

Method: The authors introduce two new datasets suitable for research in attacks similar to SBD. They also propose a Multi-Element (ME) attack method that enhances SBD by increasing the number of poisonous elements per sample and incorporating DCT for maintaining stealthiness.

Result: On the new datasets, the proposed methods achieved Copyright Infringement Rates (CIR) and First Attack Epochs (FAE) close to or surpassing benchmark datasets. Specifically, under conditions of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI and DCT outperformed original SBD which failed to attack at all.

Conclusion: The new datasets and ME attack method provide improved capabilities for conducting copyright infringement attacks on generative diffusion models, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,
respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney
datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI
and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than
original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

TL;DR: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques. To address this, an external monitor observing the conversation at a higher granularity is proposed. A dataset was curated and tested on frontier LLMs showing an 87% attack success rate on average on GPT-4o confirming that decomposition attack is broadly effective. Additionally, random tasks can be injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents. For real-time defense, a lightweight sequential monitoring framework cumulatively evaluating each subtask was proposed achieving a 93% defense success rate, remaining robust against random task injection and cutting cost by 90% and latency by 50%.

Motivation: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks due to shallow safety alignment techniques that only detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent.

Method: Propose adding an external monitor that observes the conversation at a higher granularity and curating a large and diverse dataset for studying monitoring decomposition attacks. Also propose a lightweight sequential monitoring framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask for real-time defense.

Result: The carefully prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate, beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. It remains robust against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%.

Conclusion: Lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

### [152] [Exploring Topological and Localization Phenomena in SSH Chains under Generalized AAH Modulation: A Computational Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10195)
*Souvik Ghosh,Sayak Roy*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper explores generalized SSH models using computational methods, examining effects of quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving on topological phases. It identifies localization transitions, the non-Hermitian skin effect, and engineered Floquet topological insulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of the SSH model under complex conditions such as quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving, expanding knowledge on topological phases and their robustness.

Method: Using exact diagonalization and numerical solvers to map phase space via spectral properties and IPR; employing PCA for phase classification; investigating non-Hermitian systems and applying periodic Floquet drive.

Result: Standard SSH edge states are destroyed by strong AAH modulation; localization can obscure topological signatures; non-Hermitian skin effect observed; Floquet topological insulator successfully engineered.

Conclusion: Generalized SSH models exhibit rich phenomena, including localization transitions, non-Hermitian effects, and dynamically-induced topological phases.

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

TL;DR: This paper conducts large-scale reactive simulations for a symmetric battery cell using active learning and deep neural networks, revealing a new crystalline disordered phase in the SEI and explaining experimental observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and control atomistic-level reactions governing the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in next-generation solid state batteries.

Method: Large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials. Unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments are used to characterize reactions and interdiffusion at the interface.

Result: Discovery of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$ in the SEI. Simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms.

Conclusion: The approach creates a digital twin from first principles without adjustable parameters fitted to experiment, offering insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

Motivation: 高维分类任务中，在双重不平衡（类别不平衡和数据维度不对称）条件下，传统随机森林特征选择方法会产生不稳定或误导性的特征重要性排名。

Method: 提出一种基于最小深度的阈值方案，利用树拓扑结构来评估变量的相关性，以进行特征选择。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为在双重不平衡条件下随机森林的变量选择提供了一个实用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

TL;DR: 研究人员利用条件变分自动编码器（CVAE）生成全球海洋生态系统模型的稳定状态预测，并显著减少了模型达到稳定状态所需的迭代次数和计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使用CVAE进行预测可以加速模型达到稳定状态的过程，从而减少计算资源的消耗。

Method: 通过预计算得到的稳定状态作为训练数据，构建从少量生物地球化学模型参数到三维收敛年度周期的映射，使用带有质量校正的CVAE进行预测，并将预测结果作为初始值进行spin-up。

Result: 与传统的均匀常数初始值相比，使用CVAE预测作为初始值可将spin-up所需的迭代次数减少50%至95%，具体取决于停止准则。而使用训练数据的平均值作为初始值虽然也能加速spin-up，但效果远不如CVAE方法显著。

Conclusion: CVAE能够提供合理良好的稳定状态预测，显著减少spin-up所需的迭代次数和计算时间，是一种有效的加速方法。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is
essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on
large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or
lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we
present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model,
NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent
worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest
heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above
the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature
intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks
of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate
models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing
a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather
under climate change.

Conclusion: CARE provides a benchmark and dataset suite for the Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes, addressing the lack of standardized benchmarks in this field.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

TL;DR: The paper presents three methods for identifying critical residues in a protein using Random Geometric Graph (RGG) and compares them with experimentally-ascertained critical residues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify critical residues of a protein which are essential for its function.

Method: 1. Learning an RGG variable with organic thresholding and comparing it with extant thresholding techniques. 2. Developing a criticality measure by ranking the differences between posterior probabilities of full graph variable and graph variable with one residue omitted. 3. Parametrising criticality based on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees during the simulation.

Result: The results obtained from the three distinct criticality parameters are compared against experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Conclusion: The presented methods provide effective ways to identify critical residues in proteins.

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHA schemes are becoming more vulnerable to automated attacks by deep neural networks. Existing adversarial attack methods often distort images, hindering human interpretation and limiting applicability in scenarios without initial input images.

Method: Proposes UAC which uses LLM to generate adversarial examples guided by text prompts. For targeted attacks, EDICT optimizes dual latent variables in a diffusion model. For untargeted attacks, BP-UAC uses a two-step optimization strategy with multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification.

Result: Experiments indicate that BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across different systems while generating natural CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

Conclusion: UAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and provides effective methods for both targeted and untargeted attacks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARKE, a method that enhances prompt-aware diversity in text-to-image diffusion models without significant computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have shown success in image synthesis and generative modeling but struggle with maintaining diversity in generated samples especially when dealing with broad semantic prompts.

Method: SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance to dynamically condition diversity measurement on similar prompts, reducing computational complexity from O(n^3) to O(n) through Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance.

Result: Numerical tests on several text-to-image diffusion models show that SPARKE improves prompt-aware diversity without incurring significant computational costs.

Conclusion: SPARKE is an effective method for enhancing prompt-aware diversity in text-to-image diffusion models while maintaining low computational costs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enhancing discriminator performance in scenarios with limited labeled data by leveraging the compositional properties of scores from diffusion models.

Method: ScoreMix mixes scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling to generate challenging synthetic samples. It investigates class-selection strategies and finds better performance when combining classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space.

Result: ScoreMix significantly improves discriminative capabilities across all studied benchmarks without extensive parameter searches.

Conclusion: ScoreMix demonstrates practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively mitigating problems related to large dataset collections.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

TL;DR: 本研究通过转移学习和不确定性量化（UQ）全面评估了基于深度学习的皮肤病变分类方法，使用HAM10000数据集。结果表明，结合支持向量机（SVM）的CLIP视觉变换器提供了最佳分类性能；在不确定性量化方面，集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理之间提供了良好的平衡，而EMCD对不确定预测更为敏感。这强调了将不确定性量化整合到深度学习医学诊断中的重要性，以提升实际临床应用中的性能和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌的准确可靠诊断对于早期治疗和改善患者预后至关重要。尽管深度学习模型在自动化皮肤癌分类方面展现出潜力，但其性能可能受到数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性意识的限制。因此，本研究旨在通过转移学习和不确定性量化来改进深度学习模型的性能和可靠性。

Method: 第一阶段：基准测试多个预训练特征提取器（包括CLIP变体、ResNet50、DenseNet121、VGG16和EfficientNet-V2-Large），结合传统分类器如SVM、XGBoost和逻辑回归进行皮肤病变分类。
第二阶段：引入不确定性量化方法（MCD、Ensemble和EMCD），并使用不确定性感知指标（如UAcc、USen、USpe和UPre）评估模型的准确性和可靠性。

Result: 第一阶段：CLIP视觉变换器（尤其是LAION CLIP ViT-H/14与SVM结合）表现出最高的分类性能。
第二阶段：集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理之间提供了良好的平衡，而EMCD对不确定预测更为敏感。

Conclusion: 将不确定性量化整合到深度学习医学诊断中可以增强实际临床应用中的性能和信任度，特别是通过集成方法和EMCD等技术。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督多模态框架，用于从有限输入生成结构化的SOAP笔记，减少医生负担并达到与GPT-4o等模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症类型，而手动记录患者就诊的详细SOAP笔记耗费大量人力，导致医生过劳。因此需要一种自动化方法来生成这些笔记以减轻医生的工作量。

Method: 开发了一个弱监督多模态框架，使用包括病变图像和稀疏临床文本在内的有限输入自动生成结构化的SOAP笔记。该方法减少了对大量人工标注数据的依赖。

Result: 该方法在关键临床相关性指标上表现与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro等先进模型相当，并引入了两个新评估指标MedConceptEval和Clinical Coherence Score (CCS)。

Conclusion: 这种新的框架可以有效生成临床相关的SOAP笔记，同时降低医生的工作负担，无需大规模注释数据即可实现可扩展的临床文档记录。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在在线学习环境中，使用VLMs（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct和Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct）通过零样本提示分析学生学术情感的面部表情。初步结果显示Qwen表现优于Llama，尤其在识别困惑表情方面具有应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督机器学习算法在跨情境泛化学生学术情感分析时效果不佳，需要反复的数据收集、标注和训练。VLMs可以通过零样本提示实现视觉任务的泛化，无需微调。

Method: 采用两个VLMs（Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct和Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct），对包含困惑、分心、快乐、中性和疲惫表情的5000张图像进行零样本提示分析。

Result: 两模型在学术面部表情识别上表现出中等性能，Qwen优于Llama；两者在识别快乐情绪上表现出色，但在检测分心行为上失败；Qwen在识别困惑表情方面表现较高。

Conclusion: VLMs具备通过零样本提示分析学生学术情感的潜力，特别是在识别困惑表情方面，可帮助识别导致学生困惑的内容。

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models for analyzing urban streetscape style differences, constructs UrbanDiffBench dataset and develops UrbanSense framework. Experimental results show the method's potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due to various factors, understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may evolve in the future.

Method: Propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, construct UrbanDiffBench dataset containing architectural images from different periods and regions, develop UrbanSense framework for urban streetscape analysis.

Result: Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05), high Phi scores confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences.

Conclusion: The method has the potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

TL;DR: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. However, these models often underperform compared to specialized models.

Result: Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. Evaluated on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding and GenEval for image generation, Pisces demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks.

Conclusion: The synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation is revealed, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders are highlighted, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform

### [172] [Starting Positions Matter: A Study on Better Weight Initialization for Neural Network Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10463)
*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper conducts an in-depth study on the effects of different weight initializations on the quantization robustness of CNNs, introducing GHN-QAT as a new method for quantization-robust CNN initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of weight initialization methods on the quantization robustness of trained models and improve the initial conditions of DNN training for quantization.

Method: An extensive study examining the effects of different weight initializations on various CNN building blocks. Introduction of Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs and further improvement through finetuning GHNs for quantized graphs (GHN-QAT).

Result: The choice of random weight initializer significantly affects final quantization robustness. GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after float32 pretraining and GHN-QAT improves quantized accuracy, with notable improvements even for 4-bit and 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: This is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN weight initialization, offering GHN-QAT as a novel approach to quantized DNN model design.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

*Shuyang Li,Shuang Wang,Zhuangzhuang Sun,Jing Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PSLG-SAM framework that breaks down RRSIS task into coarse localization and fine segmentation stages, reducing annotation requirements and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in current RRSIS methods such as dense annotation needs and complex scene interpretation.

Method: Proposes PSLG-SAM framework with two stages: coarse localization using a visual grounding network and fine segmentation guided by coordinates from the first stage, enhanced with foreground point generator and mask boundary optimization.

Result: Achieves significant performance improvements and surpasses state-of-the-art models on RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M datasets.

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM effectively addresses limitations of current RRSIS methods and demonstrates superior performance; code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

*Xiyao Wang,Zhengyuan Yang,Chao Feng,Yongyuan Liang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiaoyu Liu,Ziyi Zang,Ming Li,Chung-Ching Lin,Kevin Lin,Linjie Li,Furong Huang,Lijuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ViCrit, an RL proxy task that enhances visual perception in vision-language models by training them to identify subtle visual hallucinations in image captions. Significant improvements are shown across benchmarks, and a new evaluation benchmark, ViCrit-Bench, is also introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of extending the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs). This extension has been hindered by the lack of vision-centric tasks that are both challenging and unambiguously verifiable.

Method: The method introduced in this paper is ViCrit (Visual Caption Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task. It trains VLMs to locate a subtle, synthetic visual hallucination injected into human-written image captions. A single, subtle visual description error is inserted into 200-word captions by altering a few words related to objects, attributes, counts, or spatial relations. The model is then tasked with identifying the corrupted span given the image and the modified caption.

Result: Models trained with the ViCrit Task show significant improvements across various vision-language benchmarks. Importantly, these improvements transfer beyond natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math, indicating a potential for learning to perceive rather than merely memorizing seen objects.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs. To facilitate evaluation, the authors also introduce ViCrit-Bench, a category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception errors across diverse image domains and error types.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning (CogStream), a task to improve video reasoning by identifying relevant historical context, supported by a densely annotated dataset and the CogReasoner baseline model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in streaming video reasoning where existing methods feed all historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs causing computational burden and distraction from key details.

Method: Introduced CogStream task with a densely annotated dataset featuring hierarchical question-answer pairs. Proposed CogReasoner as a baseline model that uses visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The CogStream task and CogReasoner model effectively tackle the challenge of context-guided streaming video reasoning.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

Result: Demonstrated on bee and flower species, early results indicate the potential of this multimodal AI assistant approach for describing species habitats in understandable language.

Conclusion: This ongoing project highlights the promise of combining AI and recommended ecological modeling practices to generate interpretable causal insights into species' habitat preferences.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for
understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing
ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists.
We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species
image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The
system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval,
pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) and its automated version CEI^A for detecting nuanced biases in high-performance face recognition systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics often fail to detect demographic bias, especially subtle disparities in the tails of the score distribution in face recognition systems.

Method: CEI analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, allowing a focus on tail probabilities and considering overall distribution shapes. CEI^A is an automated version enhancing objectivity and simplifying application.

Result: Extensive experiments show CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods fall short, making it robust and sensitive for operational FR fairness assessment.

Conclusion: CEI and CEI^A provide effective tools for assessing fairness in face recognition systems and can be applied to compare statistical distributions in other problems focusing on distribution tails.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In e-commerce and digital marketing, a new Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework is proposed to generate high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos. It preserves human and product identities, understands human-product spatial relationships, and generates realistic motions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks for generating human-product demonstration videos either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions.

Method: The proposed method uses a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that injects paired human-product reference information and utilizes an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. A 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes are used for motion guidance, and structured text encoding incorporates category-level semantics.

Result: This approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

Conclusion: The Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework is effective in creating high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos with realistic interactions and preserved identities.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and

Motivation: Existing text-to-texture synthesis approaches suffer from gradual shifts in texture properties across viewpoints due to insufficient integration of previously synthesized textures and autoregressive nature. Predefined camera positions not considering object geometry also limit texture information usage, degrading overall texture consistency.

Method: TexTailor applies a resampling scheme that integrates information from previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process and fine-tunes a depth-aware diffusion model on these resampled textures. It also proposes a performance preservation loss and adaptively adjusts camera positions based on object geometry.

Result: Experiments on subsets of Objaverse and ShapeNet car datasets demonstrate TexTailor's superior performance in synthesizing view-consistent textures compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TexTailor addresses issues in existing text-to-texture synthesis by improving texture consistency through a resampling scheme, performance preservation loss, and adaptive camera positioning.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow) is a new framework that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. It introduces a symmetric learning objective for joint forward and reverse transformations, preserving entropy for generative diversity while retaining semantic information across flows. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for learning continuous transformations between distributions have limitations in jointly handling semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation tasks. The authors aim to develop a unified model that can efficiently perform these tasks while preserving semantic information and generative diversity.

Method: The authors introduce Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), which uses a symmetric learning objective to model forward and reverse transformations jointly. This ensures bi-directional consistency and maintains sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective explicitly retains semantic information across flows, enabling one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. SymmFlow supports flexible conditioning for both pixel-level and image-level class labels.

Result: SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis with FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff using only 25 inference steps. It also delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks.

Conclusion: Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow) successfully unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. By ensuring bi-directional consistency and preserving semantic information, it achieves excellent performance on various benchmarks. The authors plan to make the code publicly available.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT is a patch-based visual interpretable prototype model for image recognition which captures long-range dependencies among patches and learns robust, human-interpretable prototypes. It achieved competitive performance on retinal OCT image classification across four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based methods have issues with visualization consistency in the input pixel space and learn extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging.

Method: Proposes PiPViT which leverages a vision transformer to capture long-range dependencies among patches, uses contrastive learning, and multi-resolution input processing for effective localization of biomarkers.

Result: Competitive quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on retinal OCT image classification and delivers more meaningful explanations. Learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant.

Conclusion: PiPViT can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm using hyperbolic space for handling both instance and class recognition simultaneously. It proposes continual hierarchical metrics for evaluation and validates effectiveness on the EgoObjects dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional continual learning focuses separately on instance or class classification, but real-world applications require models to handle both concurrently.

Method: HyperCLIC leverages hyperbolic space to model hierarchical relationships between classes and instances with low distortion and compact embeddings. The framework incorporates hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives for continual embedding of hierarchical relations.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that HyperCLIC performs effectively at multiple granularities with improved hierarchical generalization when validated on the EgoObjects dataset.

Conclusion: HyperCLIC addresses the challenge of continual learning of instances and classes simultaneously by utilizing hyperbolic space, showing promise in real-world applications requiring multi-granularity recognition.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

*Emílio Dolgener Cantú,Rolf Klemens Wittmann,Oliver Abdeen,Patrick Wagner,Wojciech Samek,Moritz Baier,Sebastian Lapuschkin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology using Deep Neural Networks to generate synthetic golden standards for Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project wafer manufacturing, which can be used in defect detection. This approach outperforms the baseline decision-tree-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often depends on template matching with known golden standards. However, for InP multi-project wafer manufacturing, such standards are typically unavailable due to low production scale and high design variability, leading to manual and labor-intensive defect detection.

Method: The authors propose a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural Networks trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data. They evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated images on both synthetic data and real InP wafer photographs.

Result: The deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach, showing its effectiveness in generating 'simulated golden die' for more efficient defect detection.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enables the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined region of a wafer, enhancing defect detection efficiency. It is successfully applied in a template matching procedure for surface defect detection.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a unifying image processing framework to interpret self-attention mechanisms in Transformers, including components like positional encoding and residual connections. It introduces two modifications that enhance interpretability and improve performance in language and vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention mechanisms in Transformers are heuristic-driven and difficult to interpret, prompting the need for a robust theoretical foundation.

Method: A unifying image processing framework is developed to explain self-attention computation and related components. Two architectural modifications within transformers are introduced.

Result: The modifications lead to improved accuracy and robustness against data contamination and adversaries in language and vision tasks, as well as better understanding of long sequences.

Conclusion: The work advances the understanding of self-attention mechanisms and demonstrates practical improvements through image processing-inspired modifications.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

*Guowei Zhong,Ruohong Huan,Mingzhen Wu,Ronghua Liang,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data simultaneously. To solve these problems, the paper proposes a novel robust MER framework named Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer). CIDer integrates two key components: a Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) module. Experimental results demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made great progress but still faces challenges such as modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce excessive parameters, which limits their practicality.

Method: The authors propose a novel robust MER framework called Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer). It includes two modules: 1) Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module, which enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a weight-sharing self-distillation approach; 2) Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) module, which employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and fine-grained counterfactual texts. Also, Word-level Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) and Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) are used for reducing computational complexity and efficient multimodal fusion respectively.

Result: Experimental results show that CIDer can achieve robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training than existing methods.

Conclusion: CIDer is a novel robust MER framework that addresses the issues of modality missing and OOD data simultaneously. It achieves robust performance with fewer parameters and faster training. The code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), a unified model for ultra-large upsampling tasks in image super-resolution that significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods suffer from performance decline, blurring and other issues when the upsampling factor exceeds the range covered by the training data.

Method: The proposed method, SbCA, uses a stroke vector amplifier to decompose the image into strokes as vector graphics for magnification. It also has a detail completion module to restore missing details. The cyclic strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with this unified model trained only once for all sub-scales within the training range.

Result: Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that SbCA significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks (e.g., ×100), delivering much superior visual quality.

Conclusion: SbCA effectively addresses distribution drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, thus producing high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种针对视频抠图模型的全新且通用的Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)框架，通过两阶段量化策略、统计驱动全局仿射校准（GAC）方法和光流辅助（OFA）组件，实现了在极低比特量化下接近全精度的性能，并显著减少了计算量。实验结果表明，该方法在不同比特宽度下均优于现有量化方法，特别是在4比特量化时性能接近全精度模型，同时计算量减少8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频抠图在电影制作和虚拟现实等应用中至关重要，但由于其计算密集型模型难以部署在资源受限设备上，因此需要有效的模型压缩和加速技术。尽管量化是实现这一目标的关键技术，但现有的Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)方法在视频抠图任务中仍面临维持准确性和时间连贯性的重大挑战。

Method: 1. 提出两阶段PTQ策略：第一阶段采用基于块重建的优化进行快速稳定的初始量化并捕捉局部依赖性；第二阶段通过全局校准量化参数来最小化准确率损失。
2. 引入Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC)方法，补偿因忽略BN层效应等因素导致的累积统计失真，减少现有PTQ方法的误差达20%。
3. 设计Optical Flow Assistance (OFA)组件，利用帧间的时间和语义先验指导PTQ过程，增强模型区分复杂场景中运动前景的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的PTQ4VM方法在不同比特宽度下均达到最先进的准确率性能，特别是4-bit PTQ4VM在计算量减少8倍的情况下，性能接近全精度模型。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统地尝试了针对视频抠图模型的PTQ方法，提出了一种全新的框架，成功解决了现有方法在准确性和时间连贯性上的问题，为视频抠图模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Conclusion: VRBench offers a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities in long narrative videos, addressing previous limitations in temporal reasoning and procedural validity.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了CLIP嵌入空间中偏移不对齐与概念距离的相关性，并提出了一种新的ZSGM方法AIR，该方法显著提高了目标域生成图像的质量。

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation that reduces computational costs and improves video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video generation has great potential but remains computationally demanding, especially with Transformers' quadratic complexity. Existing linear-time models like Mamba have limitations in multi-modal and spatiotemporal tasks.

Method: Introduced M4V with a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block for integrating multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling, reducing FLOPs by 45%. Also, a reward learning strategy is used to enhance visual realism in long-context generation.

Result: M4V produces high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs as demonstrated through extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks.

Conclusion: M4V successfully addresses the challenges of computational demand and visual quality degradation in text-to-video generation, paving the way for more efficient content creation.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable approach to learn in-context image editing directly from videos, designing a block-causal diffusion transformer and introducing a new benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the possibility of learning an in-context image editing model directly from videos without relying on task-specific pipelines and expert models.

Method: A block-causal diffusion transformer is trained on three proxy tasks (next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, next-segmentation prediction) using video data annotated as interleaved multimodal sequences.

Result: The model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities, achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks, and shows potential in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.

Conclusion: An in-context image editing model can be successfully learned from videos, demonstrating versatility beyond its training domain.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

*Yuanhui Huang,Weiliang Chen,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpectralAR, a new framework for autoregressive visual generation that uses spectral tokens to achieve sequence causality and token efficiency. It performs image reconstruction with 3.02 gFID using only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive visual generation is gaining attention due to its scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared to diffusion models. However, existing methods using spatial patches for autoregressive generation contradict the causal nature of autoregressive modeling as image patches are inherently parallel.

Method: The proposed method, SpectralAR, transforms images into ordered spectral tokens with Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency components. Autoregressive generation is then performed in a coarse-to-fine manner with these sequences of spectral tokens.

Result: SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID on ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation using only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Conclusion: SpectralAR successfully realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective, achieving both sequence causality and token efficiency without additional complexities.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

### [195] [Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967)
*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), visual tokens are often longer than text tokens, causing high inference costs. Current pruning methods either retain duplicates or ignore instruction relevance, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper introduces CDPruner, a novel visual token pruning method that maximizes conditional diversity of retained tokens through determinantal point process (DPP). CDPruner is training-free, model-agnostic, and achieves state-of-the-art results on vision-language benchmarks while significantly reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of high inference cost in MLLMs due to long input visual tokens and improve upon current pruning methods that either retain numerous duplicate tokens or overlook instruction relevance.

Method: CDPruner defines conditional similarity between visual tokens based on instructions and reformulates the token pruning problem using DPP to maximize the conditional diversity of selected tokens. It is training-free and model-agnostic.

Result: CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks across diverse MLLMs. When applied to LLaVA, it reduces FLOPs by 95% and CUDA latency by 78%, while maintaining 94% of the original accuracy.

Conclusion: CDPruner effectively reduces computational cost while preserving strong performance in MLLMs by maximizing conditional diversity through DPP.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available
at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了HeadHunter框架和SoftPAG方法，通过系统地选择与用户目标一致的注意力头，实现对生成质量及视觉属性的精细控制，同时解决了现有层级别扰动的过度平滑问题，并在现代大规模扩散模型上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的扩散模型引导方法通过扰动模型来构造一个隐式的弱模型并引导生成过程远离它，而注意力扰动在无条件场景中表现出强大的性能，但缺乏确定扰动应用位置的原则性方法，特别是在Diffusion Transformer架构中。

Method: 研究者首先探索了注意力扰动的粒度，从层级别到个体注意力头，发现特定的头控制不同的视觉概念（如结构、风格和纹理质量）。基于此洞察，他们提出了HeadHunter框架，用于迭代选择与用户目标一致的注意力头，并引入了SoftPAG方法，该方法通过线性插值选定头的注意力图向单位矩阵靠拢，提供连续调节扰动强度的能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法不仅缓解了现有层级别扰动的过度平滑问题，还通过组合头选择实现了对特定视觉风格的针对性操作，在通用质量和特定风格引导方面都表现出了优越性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次对扩散模型中的注意力扰动进行了头级别的分析，揭示了注意力层内的可解释专业化，并为有效扰动策略的设计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

*Abiodun Ganiyu,Pranshav Gajjar,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: AI5GTest is an AI-powered framework that automates the validation of O-RAN components using LLMs, reducing test time and maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this paper is to address the complex testing challenges introduced by the disaggregated architecture of O-RAN, particularly in validating multi-vendor components against specifications. Existing frameworks are manual, fragmented, error-prone, inconsistent, and lack scalability.

Method: The method involves developing AI5GTest, a framework powered by LLMs (Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and Debug-LLM). Gen-LLM generates procedural flows based on specifications, Val-LLM validates compliance, and Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is used for approval.

Result: AI5GTest significantly reduces overall test execution time compared to traditional manual methods while maintaining high validation accuracy when evaluated with test cases from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications.

Conclusion: AI5GTest offers an automated, efficient, and accurate solution for validating O-RAN components, overcoming limitations of existing frameworks.

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

Motivation: Space-O-RAN provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards but its decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration.

Method: Incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols into Space-O-RAN. Distributed cognitive agents are deployed in rovers, landers, and lunar base stations to implement wireless-aware coordination strategies.

Result: Enables context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and non-real-time control layers; supports delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic compression.

Conclusion: This novel extension enhances the autonomy, robustness, and adaptability of lunar surface wireless communication systems.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its

Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,

Motivation: 在线学习因其灵活性和可访问性而迅速增长，但为了提升学习体验，个性化至关重要。其中关键的一环是为学习者提供定制化的答案。这推动了对大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成个性化答案方面的探索。

Method: 研究使用StackExchange平台，在语言学习和编程两个领域进行实验，开发了一个框架和数据集来验证自动产生的个性化答案，并采用零样本、单样本和少量样本策略生成答案，最后通过BERTScore、LLM评估和人工评估三种方法评价生成答案的质量。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在生成个性化答案方面具有巨大潜力，特别是在在线教育领域，可以通过提供示例答案进一步优化其性能。

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tina, a family of small reasoning models that achieve strong performance with minimal resources through parameter-efficient updates using LoRA during reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the cost-effectiveness of achieving strong reasoning abilities in language models.

Method: Using parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement learning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on a tiny 1.5B parameter base model to create the Tina family of models.

Result: Tina models are competitive with and sometimes surpass SOTA RL reasoning models built on the same base model, achieving a >20% reasoning performance increase and 43.33% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24 at only $9 USD post-training and evaluation cost.

Conclusion: The study highlights the surprising effectiveness and efficiency of LoRA for RL reasoning, suggesting it quickly adapts models to the structural format rewarded by RL while preserving base knowledge.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Resa, a family of reasoning models trained with SAE-Tuning, an efficient method that leverages underlying representations to elicit strong reasoning in language models at low cost and time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore cost-effective methods for eliciting strong reasoning abilities in language models by leveraging their underlying representations.

Method: Trains an SAE to capture reasoning abilities from a source model, then uses the trained SAE to guide supervised fine-tuning of a target model using verified question-answer data without reasoning traces.

Result: SAE-Tuning retains >97% of RL-trained counterpart's reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x and time by >450x. It also enhances reasoning performance on various datasets with minimal additional cost.

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning is an effective, efficient method for enhancing reasoning in language models; extracted reasoning abilities are generalizable and modular.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Motivation: The motivation is the lack of comprehensive resources for Chinese harmful content detection compared to English, leading to challenges in applying LLMs effectively for this task in Chinese context.

Method: The method involves creating a professionally annotated benchmark dataset covering six categories of harmful content from real-world data. They also develop a knowledge rule base from the annotation process and propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates human-annotated knowledge rules with implicit knowledge from LLMs.

Result: The results show that their knowledge-augmented baseline allows smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by presenting a new benchmark and knowledge rule base for Chinese harmful content detection, along with an effective knowledge-augmented approach that enhances the performance of smaller models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Motivation: There is a lack of a systematic framework to organize automatic evaluation methods across text, visual, and audio modalities in generative AI.

Method: The authors provide a comprehensive review and unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content across text, visual, and audio modalities, identifying five fundamental paradigms that characterize these approaches.

Result: A unified taxonomy was developed which comprehensively organizes automatic evaluation methods across all three modalities (text, visual, audio), demonstrating broad applicability and extending the framework from text to image and audio generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper argues that semantic degeneracy in natural language causes inherent limitations for LLMs and NLP systems, leading to computational intractability in recovering intended meanings. Through a semantic Bell inequality test with LLM agents, the study found non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation, suggesting classical frequentist-based approaches are inadequate and proposing Bayesian-style methods as more appropriate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of LLMs and NLP systems due to semantic degeneracy and explore how meaning is actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act rather than being inherent in linguistic forms themselves.

Method: Conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents as 'computational cognitive systems' to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings.

Result: Found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs significantly violating the classical boundary (|S|≤2), demonstrating non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation.

Conclusion: Classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy; Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches are proposed as more practically useful and appropriate for characterizing linguistic meaning in context.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

TL;DR: An unsupervised algorithm called Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) is introduced to fine-tune pretrained language models without external supervision. It performs as well as training with golden supervision on various tasks and surpasses crowdsourced human supervision. The method also enhances the training of advanced LMs, including improving a reward model and an assistant that outperform their human-supervised versions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty in obtaining high-quality human supervision for fine-tuning pretrained language models with superhuman capabilities.

Method: The method used is an unsupervised algorithm named Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), which fine-tunes pretrained language models using their own generated labels without external supervision.

Result: ICM matches the performance of training on golden supervision and outperforms crowdsourced human supervision on GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks. It also significantly elicits superhuman capabilities better than human labels on relevant tasks. Additionally, it improves the training of frontier LMs, where both the unsupervised reward model and assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Conclusion: Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM) provides an effective way to fine-tune language models without external supervision, especially enhancing models with superhuman capabilities.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Motivation: To address the gap in well-defined measurement and disclosure rules for human capital and provide a comprehensive tool for researchers to study human capital management.

Method: The authors use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on confirmed HC disclosures to develop a lexicon of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories. They also provide Python code and examples including fine-tuning a BERT model.

Result: A comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories was developed along with shared lexicon, data, and Python code for further research.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by discussing future research opportunities related to human capital management and disclosure.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在故事生成方面表现出色，但对其生成高质量故事的能力理解有限。本文通过计算叙事学的视角，提出一个基于文学实例的评估基准，聚焦因果合理性、角色意图性和戏剧冲突三个方面，评估LLMs在叙事规划问题上的表现。实验表明GPT-4级别的LLMs在小规模上能生成因果合理的故事情节，但涉及角色意图性和戏剧冲突的复杂推理仍具挑战性，可能需要强化学习训练的LLMs来解决。研究结果揭示了LLMs生成故事的规模与质量之间的关系，并为游戏环境中的叙事规划应用提供了洞见和思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型（LLMs）生成高质量故事的能力理解有限，主要由于自动评估方法的挑战以及人工评估的高成本和主观性。同时，计算叙事学为定义一个好的故事提供了有价值的见解，这启发了我们在符号叙事规划方法中评估LLMs的故事生成能力。

Method: 作者提出了一个基于文学实例的评估基准，用于评估LLMs在叙事规划方面的能力。该基准主要关注三个关键方面：因果合理性、角色意图性和戏剧冲突。然后使用这个基准对不同级别的LLMs进行实验测试，分析其在生成故事时的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，GPT-4级别的LLMs可以在小规模上生成因果合理的故事情节。然而，在涉及角色意图性和戏剧冲突的复杂推理方面，这些模型仍然面临挑战。可能需要通过强化学习训练LLMs以应对更复杂的叙事规划任务。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，尽管高级别的LLMs在小规模故事生成方面表现出色，但在涉及复杂推理的任务上仍有不足。研究还揭示了LLMs在生成故事时的规模与质量之间的关系，并为游戏环境中应用LLM叙事规划提供了洞见和考虑因素。

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

TL;DR: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often fail at simple strategic games despite excelling in complex math problems. A new benchmark, TTT-Bench, evaluates LRMs' basic reasoning abilities through Tic-Tac-Toe-style games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reasoning capabilities of LRMs beyond STEM-related tasks and assess their performance on basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning tasks.

Method: Introduced TTT-Bench, a benchmark with four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, and used a programmatic approach to generate verifiable game problems for evaluation.

Result: State-of-the-art LRMs that perform well on hard math problems often fail at these simple reasoning games. Models scored significantly lower on TTT-Bench compared to other benchmarks like MATH 500 and AIME 2024.

Conclusion: LRMs struggle with long-term strategic reasoning in simple, non-STEM related tasks, indicating a gap in their reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Motivation: 当前缺乏针对葡萄牙语的仇恨言论分类的大型语料库，特别是在细粒度分类和少数群体保护方面。此外，现有的葡萄牙语数据集大多来自社交媒体领域，风格单一且容易过拟合。因此，需要一个新的语料库来解决这些问题并促进相关研究的发展。

Method: 通过四个阶段构建ToxSyn-PT语料库：(1) 创建紧凑的手动策划种子；(2) 使用指令调整的语言模型进行少样本扩展；(3) 基于同义改写的增强；(4) 丰富化处理并添加中立文本以防止过度拟合。最终生成了一个类别平衡、风格多样且不局限于社交媒体领域的语料库。

Result: 在二元分类和多标签分类任务上的实验结果表明，ToxSyn-PT在五个公共葡萄牙语仇恨言论数据集上表现良好，显示出强大的泛化能力，即使在与传统基准不同的领域也能有效工作。

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT是一个创新的葡萄牙语语料库，适用于细粒度仇恨言论分类。它具有类别平衡、风格多样等优点，可以有效避免过拟合并跨领域泛化。该语料库的发布将有助于推进合成数据和低资源环境下的仇恨言论检测研究。

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否具有类似于人类的先验知识（即'贝叶斯大脑'），并挑战之前关于语言模型决策是概率性的假设。

Method: 通过实验分析不同大型语言模型在各种情况下的决策模式，提出一种方法来区分吉布斯采样中的随机和确定性决策模式，以避免推断出误导性的语言模型先验。

Result: 发现语言模型在某些条件下表现出近乎确定性的决策，即使采样温度非零；还发现未经适当审查的系统可能会收敛到一个“错误的先验”。

Conclusion: 语言模型的决策并不总是概率性的，需要仔细审查以正确理解其决策模式。

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been used for selecting useful data samples but requires too many resources.

Method: Propose ClusterUCB which performs clustering on training data pool, frames inter-cluster data selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, and leverages a modified UCB algorithm for solving it.

Result: ClusterUCB achieves comparable results to original gradient-based methods while greatly reducing computing consumption.

Conclusion: ClusterUCB is an efficient method for data selection in the fine-tuning of large language models.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

TL;DR: Flick is a new method for few-label text classification that improves pseudo-label quality through a novel refinement component, demonstrating superior performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for few-label text classification either struggle with noisy pseudo-labels or are complex and prone to overfitting, especially in low-resource linguistic contexts.

Method: Flick introduces a pseudo-label refinement component that distills high-confidence pseudo-labels from an initial broad set of clusters using single-cluster cohesion and an adaptive top-k selection mechanism.

Result: Flick demonstrates efficacy across 14 diverse datasets, including challenging low-resource languages, showcasing superior performance and adaptability.

Conclusion: Flick addresses the challenge of few-label text classification in low-resource contexts by improving pseudo-label quality and enabling robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但在验证自身输出正确性方面仍有困难。现有解决方案通常依赖独立的验证模型或需要多阶段自我修正训练管道，这限制了可扩展性。本文提出了政策即生成验证器（PAG），这是一个简单有效的框架，使LLMs能够在统一的多轮强化学习范式中通过交替担任政策和验证角色进行自我修正。与先前的方法不同，PAG引入了一种选择性修订机制：模型仅在其自身的生成验证步骤检测到错误时才修订答案。这种先验证后修订的工作流程不仅缓解了模型崩溃，还同时增强了推理和验证能力。广泛的实验表明，PAG作为政策，提高了直接生成和自我修正的准确性；作为验证器，其自我验证优于自我一致性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但它们难以可靠地验证自身输出的正确性。现有的解决方法要么依赖单独的验证模型，要么需要多阶段的自我修正训练管道，这些都限制了可扩展性。因此，研究者们希望开发一种新的框架，能够更有效地让LLMs进行自我修正，并且不需要额外的模型或复杂的训练过程。

Method: 提出了一种名为Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG)的新框架。该框架允许LLMs在一个统一的多轮强化学习范式中交替扮演政策和验证者的角色。PAG的特点在于它引入了一个选择性修订机制，只有当模型自身的生成验证步骤检测到错误时，才会对答案进行修订。这种方法不同于以往总是生成第二次尝试的策略，无论模型是否有信心。

Result: 通过在各种推理基准上的广泛实验，证明了PAG的双重进步。作为政策，它提升了直接生成和自我修正的准确性；作为验证器，它的自我验证表现优于自我一致性。这意味着PAG不仅能改善模型的推理能力，还能增强其验证自身输出的能力。

Conclusion: PAG提供了一种简单而有效的方法，使LLMs能够在不依赖额外模型或复杂训练管道的情况下进行自我修正。通过选择性修订机制，PAG不仅缓解了模型崩溃的问题，还同时增强了模型的推理和验证能力。这一成果为未来LLMs的研究和应用提供了新的方向和可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

Motivation: 现有的DST基准测试主要关注结构化的用户-代理对话，而忽略了现实世界中复杂的多用户交互。为了评估LLMs在多用户DST中的鲁棒性并减少数据集构建成本，研究者决定利用LLMs进行数据标注的优势，将第二个用户的话语系统地纳入对话中。

Method: 根据言语行为理论生成第二个用户的话语，将其融入现有的DST数据集中，从而创建一个可以控制的多用户DST评估环境。

Result: 实验结果表明，在多用户DST任务中，LLMs的表现相较于单用户DST有显著下降。这表明当前的LLMs在处理多说话者的对话状态提取和跟踪方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 需要进一步的研究来增强LLMs在多用户DST场景中的能力，以实现更真实和强大的对话状态跟踪模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks due to lack of background knowledge and tendency to hallucinate, especially focusing on the challenge of extracting reliable reasoning paths from knowledge graphs.

Method: RRP framework mines the knowledge graph by combining the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information through relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. A rethinking module evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.

Result: Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. RRP can be integrated into various LLMs to enhance reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: RRP distills effective guidance for LLM reasoning by generating high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of LLMs for detecting life-threatening language, comparing their performance with traditional methods. LLMs, particularly Mistral and Llama-2, outperform traditional methods in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting life-threatening language is crucial for protecting individuals in distress, promoting mental health, preventing harm, and reducing loss of life.

Method: Three open-source LLMs (Gemma, Mistral, Llama-2) with 7B parameters are fine-tuned on datasets with class balance, imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Traditional methods like bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers are also used for comparison. Upsampling technique is employed to handle imbalanced data.

Result: LLMs show strong performance compared to traditional methods. Mistral and Llama-2 perform best in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios while Gemma follows closely behind. The upsampling technique benefits traditional methods more than it does LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs have great potential for real-world applications in detecting life-threatening language.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents PREMISE, a prompt-based framework that reduces reasoning overhead in large reasoning models without modifying model weights, achieving significant reductions in token usage and cost while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the verbosity and high cost of reasoning traces in large reasoning models, which limits their deployment in latency-sensitive or API-constrained settings.

Method: PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundant computation. It optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search balancing token length and answer validity, all within a single-pass black-box interface.

Result: On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 datasets, PREMISE matches or exceeds baseline accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by up to 87.5% and cutting costs by 69-82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization via frameworks like PREMISE offers a practical and scalable way to achieve efficient LRM inference without sacrificing reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

Method: The paper introduces an LLM revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by using the LLM's reasoning ability and local context such as lecture notes containing correct named entities.

Result: On the introduced NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, the proposed technique achieves up to 30% relative WER reduction for named entities.

Conclusion: The LLM revision mechanism effectively reduces WER for named entities in ASR systems, highlighting the potential of leveraging LLMs and local context for improving ASR accuracy.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) are a promising alternative to traditional LLMs, but existing sampling strategies have limitations. This paper introduces SlowFast Sampling, a dynamic strategy that alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages, guided by three principles. It can be integrated with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Experiments show significant speedups with minimal accuracy drop, outperforming autoregressive baselines in throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the static behavior of existing sampling strategies for diffusion-based language models which leads to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility.

Method: Propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages, guided by the certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle. Integrate this strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.

Result: SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. It outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput.

Conclusion: Well-designed sampling strategies can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain

is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base

TL;DR: The paper introduces Domain2Vec, a method to decompose datasets into meta-domains for improving language model pretraining efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying the optimal data mixture for language model pretraining in a computationally efficient manner.

Method: Domain2Vec decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of meta-domains, using a classifier to generate domain vectors that represent data distribution. It operates under the Distribution Alignment Assumption (DA^2) to align training and validation data distributions for better performance.

Result: Experiments show that Domain2Vec can achieve the same validation loss with only 51.5% of the computation compared to original methods, and improves downstream task performance by an average of 2.83% under the same compute budget.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec is an effective approach for optimizing data mixtures in language model pretraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and enhancing downstream task performance.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

### [228] [Generalization or Hallucination? Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887)
*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can both generalize and hallucinate new information through a mechanism called out-of-context reasoning (OCR). This study formalizes OCR, demonstrating its role in these behaviors via experiments on five LLMs. A theoretical analysis reveals that OCR arises from the implicit bias of gradient descent favoring certain solutions, providing a foundation for mitigating undesirable behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models generalize remarkably from new facts but also hallucinate incorrect information during fine-tuning.

Method: The study conducts experiments across five prominent LLMs to confirm that out-of-context reasoning (OCR) drives both generalization and hallucination depending on causal relationships between concepts. It formalizes OCR as a synthetic factual recall task and uses a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and value matrices to solve it. Theoretical analysis examines the role of matrix factorization and gradient descent's implicit bias.

Result: OCR is confirmed to be responsible for both generalization and hallucination in LLMs. Models with factorized output and value matrices can learn OCR tasks more effectively due to the implicit bias of gradient descent favoring solutions minimizing the nuclear norm of combined matrices.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the OCR phenomenon in LLMs, which can help analyze and mitigate undesirable behaviors such as hallucinations when injecting knowledge.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

### [229] [Decomposing MLP Activations into Interpretable Features via Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10920)
*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to decompose MLP activations in large language models, identifying interpretable features that outperform existing methods and revealing a hierarchical structure in activation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for finding interpretable directions in activation space, such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs), struggle with causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability.

Method: Directly decomposing MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), ensuring learned features are sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons mapped to their activating inputs.

Result: SNMF-derived features outperform SAEs and a supervised baseline on causal steering tasks, align with human-interpretable concepts, and reveal reuse of specific neuron combinations across semantically-related features.

Conclusion: SNMF is presented as an effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in large language models.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Motivation: Current LLM-driven data science agents have limitations in real-world effectiveness due to rigid workflows and inflexible coding strategies that restrict them to simple, classical problems.

Method: AutoMind incorporates three main innovations: (1) a curated expert knowledge base for domain expertise, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm for exploring solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy tailored to task complexity.

Result: Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks indicate that AutoMind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further analyses confirm its effectiveness, efficiency, and high-quality solution characteristics.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a significant advancement towards fully automated data science, showcasing robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

### [231] [DUN-SRE: Deep Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10309)
*Yuliang Zhu,Jing Cheng,Qi Xie,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Qingyong Zhu,Yuanyuan Liu,Xin Liu,Jianfeng Ren,Chengbo Wang,Dong Liang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes DUN-SRE, a deep unrolling network with spatiotemporal rotation equivariance for dynamic MRI reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic MRI exhibits transformation symmetries like spatial rotation and temporal symmetry which can be leveraged to improve image quality in reconstruction models. Existing ECNNs fail to model temporal symmetry.

Method: DUN-SRE is proposed, using a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture that integrates data consistency and proximal mapping into a unified framework. It ensures rigorous propagation of spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints.

Result: Experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets show state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving rotation-symmetric structures and offering strong generalization.

Conclusion: DUN-SRE significantly improves dynamic MRI reconstruction by incorporating spatiotemporal rotation equivariance, showing promise for broader applications.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

*Cheng Wang,Siqi Chen,Donghua Mi,Yang Chen,Yudong Zhang,Yinsheng Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large amounts of manually annotated data. This paper proposes SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling, achieving superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation using deep learning typically requires large amounts of manually annotated data, which is challenging to obtain for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data.

Method: The proposed method is called SWDL-Net, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework that combines the complementary advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The Laplacian pyramid is used for edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance detail precision through flexible feature mapping. A difference learning mechanism effectively integrates these complementary approaches to achieve superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries.

Result: Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data further confirm the superiority of our approach.

Conclusion: SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework combining Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling, achieves superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries in medical images, even with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly

downstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision.
The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on
segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of
architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a
comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image
segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts
underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different
declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on
the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and
others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their
performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific
models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with

### [234] [SNR and Resource Adaptive Deep JSCC for Distributed IoT Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10699)
*Ali Waqas,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新的SNR和计算适应性分布式CNN框架，用于物联网设备和边缘服务器之间的无线图像分类。通过引入学习辅助智能遗传算法（LAIGA），优化网络配置以适应给定的FLOPs约束和SNR条件，提高低SNR和有限计算资源下的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于DNN的联合源信道编码（JSCC）方案在处理传感器数据时面临计算限制和噪声无线信道传输的问题。大多数现有方法依赖于固定的网络分割和静态配置，缺乏对变化的计算预算和信道条件的适应性。

Method: 提出了一个SNR-和计算适应性的分布式CNN框架，并引入了学习辅助智能遗传算法（LAIGA）。该算法通过探索CNN超参数空间来优化网络配置，同时满足给定的FLOPs约束和SNR条件。LAIGA能够智能地排除超出IoT设备计算预算的不可行网络配置，并利用基于随机森林的学习辅助避免彻底探索超参数空间。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的框架在低SNR和有限计算资源的情况下优于固定分割架构和现有的SNR自适应方法。与现有的基于JSCC的SNR自适应多层框架相比，在SNR低至-10dB、IoT设备计算预算范围为1M到70M FLOPs的情况下，分类准确率提高了10%。

Conclusion: 所提出的SNR-和计算适应性分布式CNN框架通过LAIGA算法成功解决了现有方法在适应不同计算预算和信道条件方面的不足，显著提高了无线图像分类的性能。

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

### [235] [FastFLUX: Pruning FLUX with Block-wise Replacement and Sandwich Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10035)
*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have resulted in models like FLUX with large parameter sizes leading to slow inference and high memory usage. Current acceleration methods suffer from performance degradation and training costs. To address these issues, the authors propose FastFLUX, a pruning framework for enhancing FLUX's inference efficiency. It includes Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) and Sandwich Training (ST). Experiments show that FastFLUX maintains high image quality while significantly improving inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the inference efficiency of FLUX, a highly expressive model for text-to-image generation, by reducing its massive parameter size without significant performance degradation or high training costs.

Method: The method involves proposing FastFLUX, an architecture-level pruning framework that uses Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) to replace complex residual branches with lightweight linear layers while preserving shortcut connections for stability. Additionally, it introduces Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning strategy using LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks to mitigate performance drops caused by structural replacement.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while significantly improving inference speed, even when 20% of the hierarchy is pruned.

Conclusion: FastFLUX successfully addresses the limitations of existing acceleration methods by enhancing the inference efficiency of FLUX without compromising on image quality. The authors plan to make their code available soon.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

*Giannis Daras,Adrian Rodriguez-Munoz,Adam Klivans,Antonio Torralba,Constantinos Daskalakis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ambient Diffusion Omni, a framework that leverages low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to enhance the quality of diffusion models. It uses spectral power law decay and locality properties of natural images and demonstrates state-of-the-art ImageNet FID improvements in image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make use of lower-quality images often discarded during training to improve the performance of diffusion models.

Method: By introducing Ambient Diffusion Omni, a framework exploiting two properties of natural images - spectral power law decay and locality, and validating it through training with synthetically corrupted images.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art ImageNet FID and showed significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling.

Conclusion: Noise dampens the initial skew between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution observed, providing a theoretical justification for the approach.

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

TL;DR: The paper presents a learning-based density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks that overcomes limitations of traditional methods and generalizes from 2D to 3D domains seamlessly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DEM approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, overlapping artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial redesign when extended from 2D to 3D.

Method: A novel learning-based density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) is proposed. It uses deep neural networks with a loss function enforcing density uniformity and geometric regularity, and applies hierarchical approach for transformations at both coarse and dense levels.

Result: LDEM demonstrates superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior methods across a wide range of density distributions and can be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps for practical applications.

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to explore how Artificial Intelligence can effectively enhance human creativity by adopting the perspective of distributed creativity.

Method: The method involves identifying three primary modes through which AI can contribute to creative processes: Support (AI as a tool), Synergy (AI and humans collaborate), and Symbiosis (human and AI cognition form a unified system). These modes are defined along two dimensions: technical autonomy and perceived agency.

Result: The results examine how each configuration influences different levels of creativity, ranging from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting innovation.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper discusses the theoretical, ethical, and design implications of integrating AI into human creative processes.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human
creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of
how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

Motivation: 尽管之前的研究表明合成测试集可用于系统评估，但对其可靠性的深入分析仍显不足。此外，利用LLMs生成合成查询或文档以改进排名模型已有所应用，但用LLMs创建整个合成测试集的研究尚属初步阶段。

Method: 通过LLMs生成合成查询、标签或两者来构建合成测试集，并对其进行系统评估。研究首先通过实证方法展示评估结果中存在的偏差，分析这种偏差对系统评估可能产生的影响，随后采用线性混合效应模型进一步验证偏差的存在。

Result: 研究发现，使用合成测试集进行评估时，评估结果中确实存在显著偏差，尤其在计算绝对系统性能时影响较大；然而，在比较相对系统性能时，这种偏差的影响可能并不显著。

Conclusion: 合成测试集在某些情况下可以作为传统测试集的补充，但在使用时需要警惕潜在的偏差问题，尤其是在涉及绝对系统性能评估时。对于相对系统性能比较，合成测试集的表现较为可靠。

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are
available at: https://github.com/rahmanidashti/BiasSyntheticData.

### [242] [Contrastive Matrix Completion with Denoising and Augmented Graph Views for Robust Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10658)
*Narges Nemati,Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning (MCCL) to address limitations of GNN-based methods in recommender systems, demonstrating improved accuracy and ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNN-based matrix completion approaches are sensitive to noisy edges and prone to overfitting, limiting their generalizability.

Method: MCCL extracts local neighborhood subgraphs for each interaction, generates two distinct graph representations with one emphasizing denoising through GNN layers with attention mechanism and the other via a graph variational autoencoder aligning feature distribution with a standard prior. A mutual learning loss function is used during training to harmonize these representations.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show up to 0.8% improvement in RMSE for numerical accuracy and up to 36% improvement in ranking metrics.

Conclusion: MCCL enhances generalizability of GNN-based approaches in matrix completion tasks for recommender systems.

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

*Yanhui Li,Dongxia Wang,Zhu Sun,Haonan Zhang,Huizhong Guo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the main approach for Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs). However, existing GNN-based KGRSs with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) do not perform well under sparse interactions. More complex models tend to perform worse in such scenarios. Therefore, LightKG is proposed, a simple and powerful GNN-based KGRS that addresses sparsity issues by using a simplified GNN layer and an efficient contrastive layer for SSL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to maintain superior performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. More complex models perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios.

Method: LightKG includes a simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework. It also incorporates an efficient contrastive layer for SSL that directly minimizes node similarity in the original graph.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time.

Conclusion: LightKG outperforms other KGRSs in recommendation accuracy and reduces training time significantly.

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is
available at https://github.com/1371149/LightKG.

*Shuaiqi Sun,Congde Yuan,Haoqiang Yang,Mengzhuo Guo,Guiying Wei,Jiangbo Tian*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces SHORE, a new LTV prediction framework for digital gaming that integrates short-horizon predictions as auxiliary tasks and uses a hybrid loss function to reduce the impact of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior. Experiments show it significantly outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction in digital gaming either rely on short-cycle observations or strong distributional assumptions, leading to underestimation of long-term value or poor robustness.

Method: Proposes SHORE, which integrates short-horizon predictions as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle targets. It also introduces a hybrid loss function combining order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, with a 47.91% relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment.

Conclusion: SHORE demonstrates practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale LTV prediction for digital games.

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE), a new framework for billion-scale graph-based multi-task learning that leverages macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific features and model correlations between tasks. It proposes Macro Graph Bottom and Macro Prediction Tower components, demonstrating superiority over existing methods through offline experiments and online A/B tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect the graph structures in billion-scale data, which limits their performance potential.

Method: The MGOE framework incorporates macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific macro features and model correlations between experts. It includes a Macro Graph Bottom for effective graph information incorporation and a Macro Prediction Tower for dynamic integration of macro knowledge across tasks.

Result: MGOE outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods in offline experiments on three public benchmark datasets and shows superiority in online A/B tests within a billion-scale recommender system.

Conclusion: MGOE represents a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based recommendation systems, effectively leveraging graph structures to enhance performance.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

### [246] [Precise Zero-Shot Pointwise Ranking with LLMs through Post-Aggregated Global Context Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10859)
*Kehan Long,Shasha Li,Chen Xu,Jintao Tang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved zero-shot document ranking. This paper introduces Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise Ranking (GCCP) and Post-Aggregation with Global Context (PAGC) to enhance pointwise methods' effectiveness while retaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of current pointwise approaches in document ranking, which ignore comparative insights between documents leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal performance. The authors aim to improve the effectiveness of pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency.

Method: The paper proposes two key innovations: 1) A Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons using an anchor document as a query-focused summary of pseudo-relevant candidates. 2) Post-Aggregation with Global Context (PAGC), which efficiently integrates contrastive relevance scores with existing pointwise methods without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments on TREC DL and BEIR benchmarks show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. It also achieves competitive performance against more computationally intensive comparative methods.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their GCCP and PAGC strategies effectively enhance the performance of pointwise document ranking methods without sacrificing efficiency, providing a practical solution for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

*Wei Chen,Giacomo Dimarco,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multiscale control variates strategy with structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs) to accelerate Monte Carlo sampling for high-dimensional kinetic equations with stochastic parameters, achieving variance reduction while maintaining physical consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational challenges in uncertainty quantification (UQ) of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters due to high dimensionality and slow convergence of traditional Monte Carlo methods.

Method: Adopt a multiscale control variates strategy leveraging low-fidelity solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. Introduce surrogate models based on SAPNNs that satisfy key physical properties and are trained on low-fidelity models enriched with selected high-fidelity samples.

Result: Numerical results show improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques across both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology enables efficient large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ.

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

*Zhecheng Liu,Jeff D. Eldredge*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: A transformer-based reinforcement learning framework is proposed to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic lift in gust sequences via pitch control, which outperforms the best proportional control and shows good generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear flow control strategies designed for weak disturbances may not remain effective in strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions, but they can be leveraged for developing a better strategy.

Method: The study proposes a transformer-based reinforcement learning framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. Two techniques are used to accelerate training - pretraining with an expert policy (linear control) and task-level transfer learning (extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to multiple gusts).

Result: The learned strategy outperforms the best proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts increases. The control strategy effectively generalizes to an environment with an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. Quarter-chord pitching control achieves superior lift regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord pitching control.

Conclusion: The proposed transformer-based RL framework shows good generalizability and offers a promising approach to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined with the proposed acceleration techniques.

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: OmniFluids is a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that combines physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning to enable fast inference and accurate prediction under limited or zero data supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics is crucial for scientific and engineering applications but comes with prohibitive computational costs. Existing methods such as PINNs, neural operators, and hybrid physics-aware methods have limitations in terms of retraining, large labeled datasets, speed gains, and stability.

Method: The OmniFluids framework integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning. It includes key components like a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers for efficient modeling while maintaining integration with physics-based supervision.

Result: OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy across two- and three-dimensional benchmarks. It delivers 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers and accurately recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data.

Conclusion: OmniFluids establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for safety validation of automated driving systems by leveraging the joint probability distribution of scenario parameters.

Method: Application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models which combines multimodal expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and flexibility of copulas, allowing separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies.

Result: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models outperform previously proposed approaches in terms of likelihood and Sinkhorn distance when evaluated across 18 million scenario instances.

Conclusion: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models present a strong foundation for future scenario-based validation frameworks for automated driving systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of robot manipulation in real-world settings such as warehouses, specifically for picking diverse items from unstructured piles.

Method: Utilize multiple input modalities (RGB, depth, semantic segmentation) to estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained using real-world item picking data with a combination of multimodal pretrain and finetune.

Result: The approach demonstrates improved performance across different item configurations, pick scenes, and object types. Ablation studies show the importance of training over multiple modalities and the ability to use a subset of them during finetuning and inference.

Conclusion: Autonomous learning from sparsely-labeled real-world data can lead to improved robotic operation solutions at industrial scale.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new framework called VLFly is proposed for UAVs to perform language-guided flight by outputting continuous velocity commands from egocentric observations without localization or active ranging sensors. It integrates an instruction encoder, a goal retriever, and a waypoint planner, achieving robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The current challenges in vision-and-language navigation include generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces. This calls for a novel approach that can address these limitations.

Method: VLFly integrates three modules: 1) An instruction encoder based on a large language model that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts; 2) A goal retriever powered by a vision-language model that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity; 3) A waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control.

Result: VLFly consistently outperforms all baselines across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning. Real-world VLN tasks in both indoor and outdoor environments show that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even with abstract language input.

Conclusion: VLFly presents a significant advancement in the field of vision-and-language navigation for UAVs, offering improved generalization and eliminating the need for fixed discrete action spaces.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)

It also demonstrates general predictability beyond specific cases, expected to aid robot navigation and exploration in complex terrains.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online
and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of
high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline
phases.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice conversion technology is crucial in various applications, but existing systems may not offer both low latency and high quality simultaneously.

Method: RT-VC uses an articulatory feature space to separate content and speaker characteristics and applies DDSP for efficient vocoding directly from these features.

Result: RT-VC maintains SOTA synthesis quality while reducing CPU latency by 13.3% to 61.4 ms.

Conclusion: RT-VC presents a successful approach for zero-shot real-time voice conversion with reduced latency and maintained high quality.

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications
ranging from assistive communication to entertainment. In this paper, we
present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers
ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an
articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker
characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice
transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal
processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory
features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, RT-VC achieves a CPU latency of 61.4 ms,
representing a 13.3\% reduction in latency.

### [260] [Robust Unsupervised Adaptation of a Speech Recogniser Using Entropy Minimisation and Speaker Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10653)
*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel loss function and a 'speaker code' to make adaptation of speech recognisers to a single minute of data robust, achieving significant improvements in word error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognisers typically perform well only in specific environments and require adaptation for optimal performance elsewhere. However, adapting to a new speaker often lacks sufficient labeled data for robust fine-tuning.

Method: The paper introduces a combination of approaches: a novel loss function called the conditional entropy over complete hypotheses, which uses multiple hypotheses to make adaptation more robust to errors; and a 'speaker code', a short vector that characterises a speaker, requiring little data to estimate.

Result: On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one minute of adaptation data, increasing to 29% on 10 minutes of data.

Conclusion: The proposed combination of approaches effectively enhances the robustness of speech recogniser adaptation with limited data.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper explores strategy proof mechanisms for facility location aiming to maximize equitability among agents using the Gini index and compares these with Nash welfare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving equitability in facility location problems while ensuring strategy proof mechanisms, particularly focusing on the limitations and possibilities of bounding approximation ratios.

Method: Proposes evaluating mechanisms based on the complemented Gini index rather than the Gini index itself, analyzing both deterministic and randomized mechanisms, and comparing their performance in approximating Nash welfare.

Result: Shows an impossibility result for bounding the approximation ratio of the Gini index with strategy proof mechanisms, provides insights into how well different mechanisms can approximate the complemented Gini index and Nash welfare.

Conclusion: Equitability in facility location problems cannot be perfectly achieved with strategy proof mechanisms when measured by the Gini index, but meaningful approximations can be obtained through alternative measures like the complemented Gini index and Nash welfare.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

*Yuke Xie,Hervé Chauris,Nicolas Desassis*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: Diffusion models are promising for inverse problems like Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) in seismic imaging, but conventional methods face challenges due to noise and instability. This paper proposes integrating a pretrained DDPM as a generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. The method avoids reverse diffusion, operates in clean image space, requires fewer iterations, and can be introduced as a simple regularization term. Experiments show enhanced fidelity and robustness compared to traditional and GAN-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of physics-constrained computational seismic imaging, particularly the instabilities in non-linear solvers like FWI caused by noisy intermediate states during the reverse diffusion process.

Method: Propose a framework that integrates a pretrained DDPM as a score-based generative diffusion prior into FWI via a score rematching strategy. This approach eliminates the need for reverse diffusion sampling, operates entirely in the clean image space, and introduces the generative diffusion prior as a regularization term in the standard FWI update rule.

Result: Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method provides higher fidelity and robustness than conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while maintaining practicality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The integration of a generative diffusion prior through the proposed score rematching strategy enhances the stability, convergence, and quality of FWI, offering a practical and efficient solution for seismic imaging and other inverse problem tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper outlines a method for automatically constructing a classifier using radar data, propagation modeling, and mathematical criteria. The final model has 2669 coefficients and uses both calculated and measured parameters. Calibration was done using meteor trail scattered signals. Optimal number of classes is found to be 37 with 25 frequently observed, 14 confidently separated, and 10 interpreted. Dynamics of class observation and dependence on latitude at different solar/geomagnetic activity levels are presented, consistent with known mechanisms. Key parameters for class identification include signal trajectory shape, scattering height, and Doppler velocity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automatic method for constructing a classifier that can process data from decameter coherent scatter radars effectively, utilizing only radar-obtained data, automatic modeling results of radio wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical quality estimation criteria.

Method: The method involves training a model using two years' worth of data obtained by 12 radars from the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks. Radar data includes both calculated parameters of radio wave propagation in the model ionosphere and directly measured parameters. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements is performed using meteor trail scattered signals.

Result: The analysis determined the optimal number of classes in the data to be 37, with 25 being frequently observed. Among these, 14 classes were confidently separated across different model training variants, and a preliminary interpretation of 10 classes was conducted. The dynamics of various class observations and their dependence on geographical radar latitude at different solar and geomagnetic activity levels were presented, showing consistency with known physical mechanisms. The most important parameters for identifying classes were identified as the shape of the signal ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height, and the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

Conclusion: An automatic method for constructing a classifier for processed radar data was successfully developed. This method relies solely on radar data, propagation modeling, and mathematical criteria. The resulting classifier, trained on extensive data from multiple radars, identifies key parameters for classifying radar observations, revealing insights into the dynamics of class observations and their dependencies on geographical and environmental factors.

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

Method: scSSL-Bench comprehensively evaluates 19 SSL methods over 9 datasets focusing on batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality prediction tasks. It also systematically assesses various data augmentation strategies.

Result: Specialized single-cell frameworks excel at uni-modal batch correction, generic SSL methods perform better in cell typing and multi-modal data integration, and random masking is the most effective augmentation technique.

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data

Motivation: To assess the ability of genomic language models to learn sequence-to-function relationships by predicting loss-of-function mutations created by translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes.

Method: Introduced Nullsettes, a set of prediction tasks, to evaluate the models' performance in predicting mutation effects. Analyzed the correlation between mutation effect prediction performance and the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant across 12 state-of-the-art models.

Result: Mutation effect prediction performance strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant. The range of likelihood values predictive of strong model performance depends highly on sequence length.

Conclusion: Considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length is crucial when using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when

Motivation: To develop a method for identifying homogeneous subsets (subcohorts) from large inhomogeneous datasets, which can be useful for discovering disease pathways and therapeutics specific to certain subcohorts.

Method: Designing an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for identifying homogeneous subsets using a rounding technique similar to Goemans and Williamson's approach. The algorithm is then applied to RNA microarray breast cancer dataset to identify patient subcohorts mainly comprised of metastatic cases and to systematically find subcohorts with co-occurring significant changes in methylation levels and nuclear receptor expression.

Result: The algorithm successfully identifies homogeneous subcohorts of patients mainly comprised of metastatic cases from the breast cancer dataset. Additionally, it systematically identifies subcohorts where statistically significant changes in methylation levels co-occur with significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.

Conclusion: Identifying homogeneous subcohorts using the developed algorithm can be beneficial for understanding disease pathways and developing therapeutics specific to these subcohorts.

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

Motivation: To explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating code issue detection and revision within software development workflows.

Method: Use a static code analysis framework to detect issues and extract detailed information. Apply iterative prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ensure accurate outputs from LLMs. Address LLM hallucinations with a custom-built 'Code Comparison App'.

Result: Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG can effectively improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and

Result: Provided experimental evidence illustrating utility of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: The methods are widely applicable and the authors share their code for the benefit of the community.

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity

sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic

responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are

Method: BugGen partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability.

Result: BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy, achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour, identified 104 previously undetected bugs, demonstrated higher syntactic accuracy than Certitude, exposed deeper testbench blind spots, generated more complex bug scenarios, and enhanced ML-based failure triage models with high classification accuracy.

Conclusion: BugGen provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

### [272] [What Users Value and Critique: Large-Scale Analysis of User Feedback on AI-Powered Mobile Apps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10785)
*Vinaik Chhetri,Krishna Upadhyay,A. B. Siddique,Umar Farooq*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper conducts the first large-scale study on user feedback of AI-powered mobile apps, analyzing over 894K reviews and revealing key themes in both positive and negative feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how users perceive, evaluate, and critique AI features in mobile apps, addressing the gap in research due to overwhelming user feedback volume.

Method: Developed a multi-stage analysis pipeline starting with human-labeled benchmark and evaluating LLMs and prompting strategies. The pipeline includes review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, validated for accuracy and consistency.

Result: Extracted over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Identified universal satisfaction drivers and domain-specific frustrations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a more accurate reflection of real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps, capturing fine-grained co-occurring sentiments often missed by traditional methods.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

TL;DR: 为了应对构建大规模GitHub问题解决数据集的挑战，本文提出了SWE-Factory自动化流水线。它包括用于环境构建的SWE-Builder、基于退出代码的评分方法以及自动验证过程。实验表明，该流水线可以有效生成有效的任务实例，并且评分和验证方法具有高准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建大规模的GitHub问题解决数据集对于训练和评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的软件工程能力至关重要。然而，传统的创建基准的方法非常具有挑战性且劳动密集型，尤其是在设置评估环境、评分测试结果和验证任务实例的阶段。

Method: 提出了SWE-Factory自动化流水线，包含三个核心自动化组件：1) SWE-Builder，一个多代理系统，用于自动构建评估环境；2) 标准化的基于退出代码的评分方法，消除了手动编写自定义解析器的需要；3) 使用可靠的退出代码信号自动进行fail2pass验证过程。

Result: 在四种编程语言的671个问题上的实验表明，流水线可以有效地构建有效的任务实例。例如，使用GPT-4.1-mini，SWE-Builder以每实例0.045美元的价格构建了269个有效实例，而Gemini-2.5-flash则以最低的每实例0.024美元的价格实现了相当的性能。基于退出代码的评分方法与人工检查相比达到了100%的准确性，自动fail2pass验证达到了0.92的精确度和1.00的召回率。

Conclusion: 希望SWE-Factory自动化流水线能够加速大规模、高质量的GitHub问题解决数据集的收集，用于训练和评估。相关的代码和数据集已发布。

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at

TL;DR: A method for fine-grained control over music generation through inference-time interventions on MusicGen is presented, enabling timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve fine-grained control over music generation by intervening during inference time in an autoregressive generative music transformer.

Method: Steer the residual stream using weights of linear probes trained on it or steer the attention layer activations; model this as a regression task for improved performance.

Result: Improved performance in tasks such as timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion compared to other methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides both global and local control over music generation when combined with the global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar
manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved
performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance
for future research in this rapidly evolving area. For more information,

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores architectural design choices for enhancing audio-LLM interaction by efficiently transferring semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs. The proposed modifications lead to significant improvements over the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid progress in curating training data for specific capabilities of Audio-LLMs, the underlying mechanisms governing efficient transfer of rich semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored.

Method: Starting with a standard audio-LLM architecture, several modifications are proposed and evaluated based on hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles. Experiments focus on delaying audio integration, using only the attention submodule for probing audio representations, and integrating an ensemble of diverse audio encoders.

Result: Experiments show that delaying audio integration until textual context is established enhances information probing, attention submodules alone can proficiently probe audio representations, and ensembles of diverse audio encoders provide richer representations. The final architecture achieves relative improvements from 10% to 60% over the baseline.

Conclusion: The study validates the approach to optimizing cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs through systematic investigation of architectural design choices.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

*Chi Zuo,Martin B. Møller,Pablo Martínez-Nuevo,Huayang Huang,Yu Wu,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces BNMusic framework to reduce environmental noise noticeability by blending it into personalized music generated from text prompts, showing effectiveness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driven by the limitations of traditional acoustic masking techniques which often need excessive volume increase due to misalignment between dominant sound and noise.

Method: Proposes a two-stage Blending Noises into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework: first stage synthesizes music encapsulating noise's essence in mel-spectrogram form; second stage adaptively amplifies the music segment to reduce noise perception while preserving quality.

Result: Experiments on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 show the framework's effectiveness in blending noise with aligned, amplified, and enjoyable music segments, reducing noise noticeability and enhancing acoustic experiences.

Conclusion: The BNMusic framework presents an effective alternative method to acoustic masking, improving overall acoustic experiences by blending and reducing environmental noise noticeability.

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Motivation: To create a more effective convolutional product that does not require zero or other padding, thereby eliminating junk information typically caused by padding in conventional methods.

Method: Propose a domain-based convolutional product (CP) and combine it with the semi-tensor product (STP) of vectors to form a new CP. This new CP is used to develop an STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN).

Conclusion: The new domain-based CP combined with STP offers an improved approach for developing CNNs without the need for padding, leading to better performance in applications such as image and third order signal identifications.

Abstract: The semi-tensor product (STP) of vectors is a generalization of conventional

### [279] [Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10073)
*Malvern Madondo,Yuan Shao,Yingzi Liu,Jun Zhou,Xiaofeng Yang,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT replanning in head-and-neck cancer treatment. Two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization, were implemented and evaluated on five patients, showing improvements over manual replanning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for head-and-neck cancer can lead to tumor underdosing and organ-at-risk overdosing, necessitating treatment replanning. Current manual replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming, prompting the need for an automated solution.

Method: The authors formulate the IMPT replanning process as a reinforcement learning problem. They implement two deep reinforcement learning algorithms - Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). These algorithms use dose-volume histograms as state representations and operate within a 22-dimensional action space of priority adjustments. Personalized agents are trained for each patient using their planning CT and augmented anatomies simulating anatomical changes.

Result: Evaluation on five head-and-neck cancer patients demonstrated that both DRL agents improved initial plan scores significantly. The DQN algorithm improved scores to 139.78 ± 6.84, and PPO to 142.74 ± 5.16, surpassing manually generated replans which scored 137.20 ± 5.58. Clinical validation confirmed better tumor coverage and sparing of organs at risk across various anatomical changes.

Conclusion: The proposed patient-specific DRL framework shows potential in addressing the complexities of adaptive proton therapy. It offers efficient offline adaptation solutions and paves the way for advancements in online adaptive proton therapy.

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

### [281] [Fundamental Limits of Learning High-dimensional Simplices in Noisy Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10101)
*Seyed Amir Hossein Saberi,Amir Najafi,Abolfazl Motahari,Babak H. khalaj*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper establishes sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices in noisy data scenarios. It proves the existence of an algorithm that can output a simplex close to the true one, analyzes information-theoretic lower bounds, and introduces a novel Fourier-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sample complexity required for learning high-dimensional simplices from noisy data and compare it with noiseless scenarios.

Method: Proves the existence of an algorithm that outputs a simplex close to the true one given sufficient samples. Derives new information-theoretic lower bounds for simplex estimation. Uses sample compression techniques and introduces a Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy observations.

Result: Shows that when SNR is sufficiently high (SNR ≥ Ω(K^(1/2))), the sample complexity for the noisy case aligns with the noiseless case. Provides lower bounds on the number of samples required for accurate simplex estimation.

Conclusion: The paper resolves an open question regarding the alignment of noisy-case complexity with the noiseless case under certain conditions and introduces a potentially widely applicable Fourier-based method.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

### [282] [Momentum Multi-Marginal Schrödinger Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10168)
*Panagiotis Theodoropoulos,Augustinos D. Saravanos,Evangelos A. Theodorou,Guan-Horng Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Momentum Multi-Marginal Schrödinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM), a new framework for inferring trajectories in complex systems with sparse data. It learns smooth measure-valued splines satisfying multiple positional constraints, improving the capture of long-range temporal dependencies and coherence of inferred trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methodologies for inferring trajectories from sparse sample snapshots rely on pairwise interpolation between adjacent snapshots, which hinders their ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies and affects the coherence of the inferred trajectories.

Method: 3MSBM lifts the dynamics to phase space and generalizes stochastic bridges to be conditioned on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal control problem. The underlying dynamics are learned by minimizing a variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal conditional bridge.

Result: Extensive experimentation validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies.

Conclusion: 3MSBM opens new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings, significantly improving convergence and scalability.

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

### [283] [Distributionally-Constrained Adversaries in Online Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10293)
*Moïse Blanchard,Samory Kpotufe*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores distributionally constrained adversaries in online learning, offering a flexible framework that bridges adversarial and stochastic settings. It characterizes learnable distribution classes against oblivious and adaptive adversaries, generalizing smoothed settings and showing that learning can occur without prior knowledge of the distribution class for certain function classes like linear classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the continuum between adversarial and stochastic settings in online learning and to provide a more general and flexible framework than existing ones such as smoothed analysis.

Method: Considered the framework of distributionally constrained adversaries where instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some constrained distribution class. Analyzed learnability against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries and explored the interplay between function class and distributional constraints.

Result: Provided a characterization of learnable distribution classes and showed that for several natural function classes, learning can be achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class.

Conclusion: The results recover and generalize known smoothed settings and demonstrate that a learner can compete against any constrained adversary within learnable distribution classes without knowing the distribution class beforehand.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

TL;DR: 研究通过信息论方法分析扩散过程中类别语义决策的时机，发现语义信息传递在扩散中间阶段最高，并且不同类别的决策时间有所不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已知生成图像的语义和结构特征在扩散逆过程的不同时间出现，但尚缺乏一种通用的信息论方法来量化这些语义决策的具体发生时刻。

Method: 使用贝叶斯分类器在线公式估计给定噪声状态下的条件熵，通过条件熵的时间导数确定噪声状态与类别标签之间信息传递最高的时间区间。此方法应用于一维高斯混合模型和基于CIFAR10数据集训练的DDPM模型。

Result: 证实了语义信息传递在扩散中间阶段最高，在后期几乎消失；并且不同类别具有不同的熵率曲线，表明其语义决策发生在不同的中间时间点。

Conclusion: 提出了一种通用的信息论方法，能够有效测量生成过程中语义决策的发生时间，并揭示了不同类别决策时间的差异。

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

*Kyohei Atarashi,Satoshi Oyama,Hiromi Arai,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Softmax函数变体BCSoftmax，通过引入上下界约束改进了输出概率的控制，并基于此提出了两种后校准方法以缓解模型预测中的过度自信和不自信问题，最终在多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Softmax函数虽然可以通过温度参数实现软控制，但缺乏对输出概率施加硬约束（如区间约束）的能力，这在需要可靠和可信赖模型的应用中至关重要。

Method: 作者提出了箱约束Softmax (BCSoftmax) 函数，这是Softmax的一个新泛化形式，可以显式地对输出概率施加上下界约束。同时，还开发了一个精确且高效的计算算法来求解BCSoftmax。此外，基于BCSoftmax，提出了两种后校准方法，通过学习输出概率或logits的上下界来缓解模型预测中的过度自信和不自信问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，在TinyImageNet、CIFAR-100和20NewsGroups等数据集上，所提出的方法在校准度量方面取得了显著的改进。

Conclusion: BCSoftmax及其相关的后校准方法为提高预测模型的可靠性提供了一种有效途径，特别是在需要可信输出的应用场景中。

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

*Maxime Haddouche,Otmane Sakhi*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores adaptive off-policy learning, extending PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing to iteratively refine policies and improve data quality. It shows faster convergence rates and outperforms static methods when intermediate policy deployments are allowed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to move beyond the limitations of static off-policy learning by investigating an adaptive approach that refines policies iteratively and re-deploys them for better data collection.

Method: The method builds on PAC-Bayesian learning with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) and extends it to an adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. A principled adjustment to the LS estimator accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and improves convergence rates.

Result: The method matches the performance of leading offline approaches in static settings and significantly outperforms them when intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across diverse scenarios confirm the advantages of adaptive data collection and the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

Conclusion: Adaptive off-policy learning with the adjusted PAC-Bayesian framework demonstrates superior performance compared to static methods, especially in settings where policies can be refined and re-deployed.

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

TL;DR: The paper reconsiders A/B testing and proposes a new family of unbiased off-policy estimators that reduce variance compared to the standard difference-in-means estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A/B testing is widely used for evaluating improvements by comparing two decision systems, but the commonly used difference-in-means estimator has room for improvement in terms of variance reduction.

Method: Introduced a family of unbiased off-policy estimators with lower variance than the standard difference-in-means approach. Among this family, identified the estimator with the lowest variance.

Result: The proposed estimator offers substantial variance reduction when the tested systems are similar, as demonstrated by theoretical analysis and experimental results.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective and practical for A/B testing scenarios where variance reduction is beneficial.

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and
offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit

effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.

*Dimitri Meunier,Antoine Moulin,Jakub Wornbard,Vladimir R. Kostic,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders using nonparametric IV regression, identifying three scenarios (good, bad, ugly) based on spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal effect estimation is crucial in many fields but challenging due to hidden confounders. Nonparametric instrumental variable regression offers a promising approach to address this issue.

Method: A two-stage least squares estimator using spectral features learned from the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments is employed. Generalization error bound for this method is derived.

Result: Performance depends on spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay: good scenario with strong alignment and slow decay; bad scenario with strong alignment but rapid decay needing more samples; ugly scenario with weak alignment leading to failure.

Conclusion: This taxonomy of outcomes was empirically validated through synthetic experiments, providing insights into when and why the method works or fails.

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to investigate how dynamical systems can be learned and modeled using a neuromorphic network, which itself is a dynamical system. The goal is to understand the computation performed by the physics of the underlying system.

Method: The method involves simulating a neuromorphic network based on a complex electrical circuit with memristive elements. This network was evaluated on its autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series using a reservoir computing framework.

Result: Optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were achieved when input voltages maximized the number of memristive components exploring the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing network coverage with input electrodes suppressed less conducive nonlinear responses.

Conclusion: The results provide valuable insights into optimizing practical neuromorphic network devices for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled
with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The
neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical
circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear
responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be
performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network
was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic
time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through
manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to

Motivation: To understand how architectural choices and activation functions affect the thermodynamic properties of bipartite energy-based neural networks (RBMs), particularly their effectiveness as associative memories.

Method: Investigating the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of RBMs with various hidden unit distributions (binary, multi-state, ReLU-like). Using connections to the Hopfield model and analytical tools from statistical physics to explore the impact of these factors on the models' thermodynamic properties.

Result: Standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity exhibit reduced critical capacity. Introducing modifications such as local biases and richer hidden unit priors restores ordered retrieval phases and significantly improves recall performance even at finite temperatures.

Conclusion: Hidden unit design is crucial in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs; theoretical results are validated by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

TL;DR: To address the challenges in transmitting high-resolution virtual scenes between cloud platforms and VR devices, this paper proposes the SC-CEE-Meta architecture. It uses semantic communication to reduce latency and improve image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to solve the practical issues faced by the metaverse, specifically the transmission of substantial data such as high-resolution virtual scenes between cloud platforms and VR devices, which is hindered by insufficient bandwidth and poor channel quality leading to speed, delay problems, and data errors.

Method: The proposed method is the Semantic Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service (SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture. This includes three modules: VR video semantic transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. Semantic modules are deployed on VR devices and edge servers for sending key semantic information instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, reducing latency and resolving resource-bandwidth conflicts. The cloud handles video synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices manage 3D reconstruction rendering modules.

Result: The SC-CEE-Meta architecture was verified on Meta Quest Pro and achieved a reduction in wireless transmission delay by 96.05% and an improvement in image quality by 43.99% under poor channel conditions.

Conclusion: The SC-CEE-Meta architecture successfully reduces latency and improves image quality in immersive metaverse services, even under poor channel conditions.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model for Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA), which synthesizes accident video clips by generating causal parts in dashcam videos. AVD can be trained without extra annotations and helps achieve competitive performance in TAA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches for TAA rely on laborious annotation of accident occurrence duration, but the long-tailed, uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes makes it difficult to identify real causal parts of accidents due to data bias and background confounding issues.

Method: The proposed AVD model generates causal video frames based on accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content of frames. It can be trained using datasets collected from various driving scenes without additional annotations. Additionally, AVD facilitates EQ-TAA with an equivariant triple loss for better TAA performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show that AVD and EQ-TAA achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in TAA tasks.

Conclusion: The AVD model effectively synthesizes accident video clips and addresses the challenges of current TAA approaches, achieving competitive performance without requiring extra annotations.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper presents an adaptive bimodal framework for HER2 prediction in breast cancer that works with either H&E or IHC images separately or together, significantly improving accuracy and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for HER2 assessment in breast cancer mainly analyze H&E or IHC images individually, despite the clinical advantage of interpreting them together. However, obtaining both types of images simultaneously is often limited by workflow complexity and cost.

Method: The method involves three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector which activates single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN which reconstructs missing modalities in feature space; 3) A hybrid training protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization.

Result: This architecture raises single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25%, achieves 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, and maintains 90.28% reliability with only IHC inputs. It also improves accuracy by 22.81%/12.90% over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, and enhances F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251 (IHC to HE).

Conclusion: The proposed framework delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring synchronized acquisition of both modalities, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. The elastic architecture has significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse healthcare settings.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse

*Kangwei Liu,Junwu Liu,Xiaowei Yi,Jinlin Guo,Yun Cao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: An audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation framework is presented, which integrates multimodal emotion binding and an attention-based latent diffusion model to enhance expressiveness and motion diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation face two main issues: reliance on single-modal control signals without utilizing their complementary strengths, and deterministic regression-based mapping that limits the expressiveness of synthesized animations.

Method: The proposed method includes a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that aligns text, audio, and emotion labels through contrastive learning for flexible emotion control. Additionally, it employs an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers to enrich motion diversity while maintaining temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics.

Result: Experiments show that this method surpasses existing approaches in most metrics, achieving a 21.6% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving physiologically plausible facial dynamics.

Conclusion: This diffusion-based framework for controllable expressive 3D facial animation successfully addresses the challenges of previous methods by leveraging multimodal signals and enhancing motion diversity.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

At the panel level, multimodal graphs are constructed linking visual elements with textual components.

Result: Evaluation results show high precision and recall across diverse narrative tasks, validating the coherence and interpretability of the framework.

Conclusion: This work contributes a scalable foundation for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal reasoning in visual media.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

*Weiyin Gong,Kai Zhang,Yanghai Zhang,Qi Liu,Xinjie Sun,Junyu Lu,Linbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper proposes Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition (WDMIR) framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis of non-verbal information and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multimodal intent recognition prioritize text analysis but often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues.

Method: The paper proposes a WDMIR framework including a wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, and a cross-modal interaction mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to trimodal integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on MIntRec show that the approach surpasses previous methods by 1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the wavelet-driven fusion module with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Conclusion: The WDMIR framework significantly improves the extraction of semantic information from non-verbal sources and sets a new state-of-the-art performance in multimodal intent recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary

### [301] [Multimodal Emotion Coupling via Speech-to-Facial and Bodily Gestures in Dyadic Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10010)
*Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela,Yukie Nagai*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This study explores the dynamics of emotional expression through speech, facial, and hand motions in human interactions using the IEMOCAP corpus. It finds that nonoverlapping speech increases activeness in lower face and mouth regions, sadness enhances expressivity during nonoverlap, anger suppresses gestures during overlaps, and prosody/MFCCs have higher prediction accuracy for articulatory regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain deeper insights into how emotional and behavioral cues are communicated in real interactions by examining the broader dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand motion.

Method: The study used region specific motion capture from dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features like low level prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions were aligned with 3D facial and hand marker displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech features to facial and hand movements.

Result: Nonoverlapping speech elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed gestures during overlaps. Prosody and MFCCs had highest accuracy for articulatory regions, while arousal and valence had lower correlations. Hand speech synchrony was enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech.

Conclusion: Understanding these multimodal emotion coupling dynamics can enhance real time emotion detection systems by improving timing and synchrony accuracy across modalities.

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

### [302] [The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872)
*Ziv Scully,Alexander Terenin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper aims to demonstrate the practical applications of the Gittins index in decision-making problems through example-driven introduction and case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Gittins index, while theoretically important, is often not considered a practical tool due to its limited application scope and subtle definition.

Method: Providing an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index and walking through several examples of problems it solves, both optimally and suboptimally.

Result: Illustrates two practical highlights: applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization and minimizing tail latency in queues, showing excellent performance in these areas.

Conclusion: The Gittins index can be fruitfully applied to practical problems, despite its reputation as primarily a theoretical concept.

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

*Xiaolin Hu,Qinghua Zhou,Bogdan Grechuk,Ivan Y. Tyukin*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) face limitations due to their lack of natural language interface. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled autoformalization, but existing approaches are limited to verifying complete proofs. This paper proposes StepProof, a novel method for granular, step-by-step verification, which breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current autoformalization methods that can only verify complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level verification.

Method: StepProof, a novel autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification. It breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs, enabling sentence-level verification.

Result: Experimental results show that StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Manual adjustments to natural language proofs further enhance StepProof's performance.

Conclusion: StepProof is a promising advancement in autoformalization, providing a more efficient and successful approach to formal proof verification.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.
