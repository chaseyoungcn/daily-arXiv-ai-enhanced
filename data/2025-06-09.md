### [1] [A Path to Loving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05352)
*John Beverley,Regina Hurley*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper establishes an ontological framework for understanding love, combining passive sensations and active evaluative judgments, using BFO and other methods to differentiate various senses of love. It defends a causal correlation model linking affective and cognitive components, laying the foundation for interdisciplinary applications in ontology engineering, AI, and sciences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the philosophical complexity and scientific relevance of love, particularly in psychology and sociology, and enhance relevant AI-based applications.

Method: Using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love and defend a causal correlation model linking the affective and cognitive components of love.

Result: Provides a precise and scalable ontological account of love, balancing its involuntary aspects with rational accountability.

Conclusion: Lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary applications, making love a subject of formal inquiry in ontology engineering, artificial intelligence, and the sciences.

Abstract: This work lays the foundations for a rigorous ontological characterization of
love, addressing its philosophical complexity and scientific relevance, with
particular emphasis on psychology and sociology, as well as highlighting ways
in which such characterization enhances relevant AI based applications. The
position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of
passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluative judgments
(e.g., perceiving the beloved as valuable), in the interest of balancing the
involuntary aspects of love with its rational accountability. To provide a
structured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other
applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work
engages with objections to the understanding of love as concatenation,
particularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment. A
causal correlation model is defended, ensuring that the affective and cognitive
components are linked. By offering a precise and scalable ontological account,
this work lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary applications, making
love a subject of formal inquiry in ontology engineering, artificial
intelligence, and the sciences.

### [2] [Contextual Memory Intelligence -- A Foundational Paradigm for Human-AI Collaboration and Reflective Generative AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05370)
*Kristy Wedel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI系统在各种组织环境中快速实施，但仍存在重大记忆限制问题。本文介绍了一种新的基础范式——情境记忆智能（CMI），将记忆重新定位为必要的适应性基础设施，以实现纵向连贯性、可解释性和负责任的决策。通过洞察层和人类参与的反思、漂移检测和理由保存，CMI使系统能够结合数据、历史、判断和变化的情境进行推理，解决当前AI架构和治理工作中的基本盲点，促进有效、可反思、可审计和社会负责的智能系统的发展，增强人机协作、生成式AI设计和机构韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在生成式AI系统的记忆组件方面取得了显著进展，但这些系统仍存在严重的记忆限制，无法存储或反思决策的完整背景，导致重复错误和普遍缺乏清晰度。因此，需要一种新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出情境记忆智能（CMI）作为新范式，结合认知科学、组织理论、人机交互和AI治理，正式化了结构化的上下文捕捉、推理和再生作为系统的基本能力。通过洞察层这一模块化架构，利用人类参与的反思、漂移检测和理由保存，将上下文记忆整合到系统中。

Result: CMI使系统能够结合数据、历史、判断和变化的情境进行推理，解决了当前AI架构和治理工作中的基本盲点。

Conclusion: 通过CMI框架，可以创建有效的、可反思的、可审计的和社会负责的智能系统，从而增强人机协作、生成式AI设计和机构韧性。

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly
implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in
memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems
still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or
reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated
errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory
Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent
systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for
longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather
than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,
human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured
capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system
capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this
vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift
detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into
systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,
judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in
current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating
intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially
responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,
generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

### [3] [Constructive Symbolic Reinforcement Learning via Intuitionistic Logic and Goal-Chaining Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05422)
*Andrei T. Patrascu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new learning and planning framework using constructive logical inference is introduced, where actions, transitions, and goals are logical propositions. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning, this method ensures safety and validity through verifiable preconditions and logical proofs, demonstrated in a gridworld with subgoals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning methods that rely on reward-based optimisation, which often result in extensive exploration, unsafe transitions, and lack of interpretability. The authors aim to develop a safer and more interpretable decision-making framework grounded in constructive logic.

Method: In this paper, the authors propose a novel framework where actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical propositions. Decision-making is performed by building constructive proofs under intuitionistic logic. This ensures that state transitions and policies are only accepted when supported by verifiable preconditions. A symbolic agent is implemented in a structured gridworld environment, where reaching a goal requires satisfying intermediate subgoals governed by logical constraints.

Result: The empirical results show that the proposed method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient convergence without any invalid actions. When compared with Q-learning, the constructive agent demonstrates superior performance in terms of safety and efficiency in the gridworld environment.

Conclusion: This work presents a new direction for reinforcement learning based on constructive logic and proof theory. It highlights the potential of this approach for safe planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI, offering an alternative to traditional numeric optimisation methods.

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces
traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In
our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical
propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs
under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and
policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions --
eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical
validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld,
where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals
(e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints.
Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive
exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive
agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking,
and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates
that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient
convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe
planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new
direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but
in constructive logic and proof theory.

### [4] [Towards Data Systems That Are Business Semantic-Centric and AI Agents-Assisted](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05520)
*Cecil Pang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为BSDS的全新数据系统，该系统以商业语义为核心，并借助AI代理，从架构、工作流到团队组织全方位整合，确保数据系统与商业需求对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据平台过于强调工具，而忽略了与商业需求的对齐，导致效率低下和延迟问题。

Method: 提出了一个名为BSDS（Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System）的数据系统。它具有模块化架构，包括与商业实体关联的精选数据、用于上下文感知AI代理的知识库以及高效的数据管道。同时，BSDS优化了适用于探索性数据分析和生产需求的工作流程，并将人类因素纳入其中，通过将数据团队的专业知识与商业语义对齐来缩小技术和业务之间的差距。

Result: BSDS通过实际应用验证，能够加速数据驱动型计划的上市时间，增强跨职能协作，并为各种规模的企业提供可扩展的蓝图。

Conclusion: BSDS重新定义了数据系统，将其从被动工具转变为主动推动组织增长的动态助力器。未来的研究可以基于BSDS探索使用复杂系统和自适应网络理论的优化策略，以及开发利用AI代理的自主数据系统。

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid
adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data
platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business
needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose
the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a
holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization
to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated
by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of
business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of
organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated
data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents,
and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with
data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving
scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows
optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements,
balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is
its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with
business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and
business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates
time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional
collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes.
Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using
complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous
data systems leveraging AI agents.

### [5] [Avoiding Death through Fear Intrinsic Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05529)
*Rodney Sanchez,Ferat Sahin,Alexander Ororbia,Jamison Heard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an intrinsic reward function inspired by early amygdala development and a novel memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. The intrinsic motivation deters exploration of terminal states, resulting in avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning in animals. Modifying the threshold of fear response produces behaviors akin to general anxiety disorders (GADs). Demonstrated in Miniworld Sidewalk environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation in evaluating reinforcement learning methods is the requirement for engineered extrinsic rewards in realistic environments. High negative rewards like death fail to provide direct feedback to agents.

Method: An intrinsic reward function inspired by early amygdala development is introduced and produced through a novel memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. Fear conditioning paradigms are used as a biologically-inspired framework.

Result: The constructed agent demonstrates avoidance behavior and can solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions, such as 'death'. Modifying the fear response threshold leads to a range of behaviors associated with general anxiety disorders (GADs).

Conclusion: This study results in a biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning paradigms that successfully demonstrate avoidance behavior in agents.

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning
algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These
behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,
curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex
behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for
engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in
engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments
containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to
the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to
the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by
early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel
memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic
motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in
avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response
is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm
of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the
Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal
condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a
biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning
paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent
that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

### [6] [When Models Know More Than They Can Explain: Quantifying Knowledge Transfer in Human-AI Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05579)
*Quan Shi,Carlos E. Jimenez,Shunyu Yao,Nick Haber,Diyi Yang,Karthik Narasimhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have led to improvements in various tasks, but it is unclear if these improvements lead to better knowledge transfer. To investigate this, the authors introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a framework for evaluating Human-AI knowledge transfer capabilities. A large-scale human study (N=118) was conducted, revealing that model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative outcomes, but the relationship is inconsistent. The analysis identifies factors mediating successful knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the critical open question of whether advancements in AI reasoning also yield better knowledge transfer, which is the ability of models to communicate reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from.

Method: The method involves introducing Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer capabilities. A large-scale human study (N=118) was conducted in a two-phase setup where humans first ideate with an AI on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions, isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding.

Result: The findings reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant outliers. The analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization and the authors release their code, dataset, and evaluation framework to support future work on communicatively aligned models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

### [7] [MMTU: A Massive Multi-Task Table Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05587)
*Junjie Xing,Yeye He,Mengyu Zhou,Haoyu Dong,Shi Han,Lingjiao Chen,Dongmei Zhang,Surajit Chaudhuri,H. V. Jagadish*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了MMTU，一个包含超过30K问题和25个真实世界表格任务的大规模基准，用于全面评估模型在理解和操作表格方面的专家级能力。当前前沿模型在该基准上的表现约为60%，显示出显著的改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在处理表格方面取得了显著进展，但对这些能力的全面评估仍然有限。现有的评估主要集中在如NL-to-SQL和Table-QA等狭窄的任务上，忽略了专业用户面临的更广泛的现实任务。这限制了我们对该领域模型理解和进步的理解。

Method: 研究者引入了MMTU，一个大规模基准测试，包含超过30K的问题，覆盖25个真实世界的表格任务。这些任务来源于计算机科学关于表格数据的研究，特别关注专业用户面临的复杂表格任务。通过结合表格理解、推理和编码等技能来评估模型的表现。

Result: 即使是最先进的推理模型（如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1）在MMTU上的得分也仅约60%，表明当前模型在这方面存在重大挑战和改进空间。

Conclusion: 研究者利用MMTU基准测试突出了关键发现，并希望这一基准能推动对结构化数据处理和分析的基础模型的理解和进一步发展。相关代码和数据已公开发布。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and
data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and

*Lianhao Zhou,Hongyi Ling,Keqiang Yan,Kaiji Zhao,Xiaoning Qian,Raymundo Arróyave,Xiaofeng Qian,Shuiwang Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAPPS, a framework combining planning, physics, and scientist input for autonomous crystal material discovery. It offers significant improvements in stability, uniqueness, and novelty compared to previous models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery, moving beyond predefined workflows to automate workflow planning based on high-level goals and scientific intuition.

Method: MAPPS integrates three components: Workflow Planner using large language models to generate multi-step workflows, Tool Code Generator synthesizing executable Python code for tasks including physics-encoded force field foundation models, and Scientific Mediator ensuring robustness through feedback and error recovery.

Result: MAPPS achieves a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared to prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data set.

Conclusion: MAPPS is presented as a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery, demonstrated through extensive experiments across various tasks.

Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal
materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to
perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow
planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we
propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as
MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a
Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator
synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a
force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator
coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures
robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,
physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials
discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in
stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models
when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across
diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous
materials discovery.

### [9] [Population-Proportional Preference Learning from Human Feedback: An Axiomatic Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05619)
*Kihyun Kim,Jiawei Zhang,Asuman Ozdaglar,Pablo A. Parrilo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents a new preference learning framework that ensures aggregate opinions and policies align proportionally with the true population distribution of evaluator preferences, using pairwise comparison data and satisfying key axioms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional preference learning methods may lead to biased policies favoring certain opinions or groups when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators.

Method: The approach infers the feasible set of evaluator population distributions from pairwise comparison data. It then constructs a policy satisfying axioms like monotonicity, Pareto efficiency, population-proportional representation, and population-bounded robustness. A soft-max relaxation method is proposed for balancing population-proportional representation with selecting the Condorcet winner.

Result: The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed framework are validated through experiments on tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

Conclusion: This novel preference learning framework can better represent diverse evaluator preferences in proportion to their population distribution, while maintaining fairness and efficiency.

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more
widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result
in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The
objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework
capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the
true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the
feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise
comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that
satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity
and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of
population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We
propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs
population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet
winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we
validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments
on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 近期研究引入了推理图的概念，通过聚类每一步推理中的隐藏状态表示提取，分析了三个关键的图论性质：循环性、直径和小世界指数。发现蒸馏模型相较于基础模型在这些性质上有显著优势，且这种优势随着任务难度和模型容量增加而增长。监督微调可以系统地扩展推理图直径并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大规模推理模型在数学基准测试中表现出色，但其内部机制尚不明确。因此，本研究旨在深入理解这些模型成功背后的原理，特别是从推理图的角度进行分析。

Method: 提出推理图概念，并通过聚类隐藏状态表示来提取推理图；系统分析推理图的三个关键图论性质（循环性、直径和小世界指数）；对比蒸馏模型与基础模型在不同任务上的表现；探讨模型容量、任务难度及监督微调对推理图结构的影响。

Result: 蒸馏模型相较于基础模型展现出更多循环、更大直径和更明显的小世界特性；这些优势随任务难度和模型容量增加而增强；监督微调能有效扩展推理图直径并提升性能。

Conclusion: 本研究通过推理图结构的理论洞察为数据集设计提供了具体指导，提升了大规模推理模型的可解释性和效能。

Abstract: Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce
the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state
representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key
graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across
multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly
more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph
diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to
their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task
difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale
and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively
with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved
dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with
performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at
boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into
reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data
construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of
large reasoning models.

*Emil Biju,Shayan Talaei,Zhemin Huang,Mohammadreza Pourreza,Azalia Mirhoseini,Amin Saberi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPRINT is a novel framework that enables large reasoning models to identify and exploit parallelization opportunities, reducing inference time and sequential tokens while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of lengthy sequential chains-of-thought in large reasoning models which result in long inference times before arriving at the final answer.

Method: SPRINT incorporates an innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel execution. Fine-tuning LRMs on curated data helps them learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended reasoning processes and execute them in parallel.

Result: Models fine-tuned with SPRINT match the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics while generating fewer sequential tokens. Significant reductions in average sequential tokens are observed for longer reasoning trajectories in out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: SPRINT effectively reduces the number of sequential tokens and inference time in large reasoning models without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically
generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference
times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we
introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed
to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for
parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an
innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning
trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel
execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the
models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended
reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive
evaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match
the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics
while generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more
than 8000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to
two out-of-distribution tasks of GPQA and Countdown with up to 45% and 65%
reduction in average sequential tokens for longer reasoning trajectories, while
achieving the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

Abstract: Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for
autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has
emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game
framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels.
However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among
agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead
treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations
are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a
metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents
within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the
inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated
driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical
signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction
results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal
is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed
Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a
simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while
reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan
datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning
tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for
planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the increasing demand for AI systems that are not only accurate but also explainable and trustworthy, considering the diverse audiences interacting with these systems.

Method: The method involves proposing a three-layered framework: algorithmic and domain-based, human-centered, and social explainability, with an emphasis on the role of LLMs in the social layer.

Result: The result is a framework that facilitates technical fidelity, user engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a trust-building process.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that aligning explanations with the expectations of different stakeholders through a multilevel framework can enhance trust in AI systems.

Abstract: The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has
intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also
explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have
proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI
systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This
paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of
explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with
the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders.
The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based,
human-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating
accessible, natural language explanations. Through illustrative case studies,
we demonstrate how this approach facilitates technical fidelity, user
engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a dynamic,
trust-building process.

Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large
language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to
novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in
a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the
persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference
heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from
the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for
reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection
practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate
how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we
outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted
interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.

*Qingbin Zeng,Ruotong Zhao,Jinzhu Mao,Haoyang Li,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrimeMind is a novel LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime, integrating Routine Activity Theory and human-annotated data to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability. It outperforms traditional methods in crime hotspot prediction and captures counterfactual scenarios effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban crime modeling methods either lack predictive accuracy (ABMs) or interpretability (deep learning), and both lack cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments.

Method: Propose CrimeMind, an LLM-driven ABM framework that integrates Routine Activity Theory to process multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal behavior. Use a training-free textual gradient method with a human-annotated dataset to align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment.

Result: Experiments show CrimeMind outperforms traditional ABMs and deep learning baselines in crime hotspot prediction by up to 24%. It also successfully captures counterfactual changes in crime patterns.

Conclusion: CrimeMind enables detailed modeling of individual behaviors and supports evaluation of real-world interventions.

Abstract: Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires
understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban
environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based
modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of
internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep
learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable
and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the
cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel
LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban
context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine
Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to
process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal
behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating
environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be
challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated
dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a
training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities
demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning
baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy,
achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we
conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy
interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime
patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual
scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual
behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束建模是约束编程的核心过程，但却是广泛应用的瓶颈。为了缓解这一问题，最近的研究探索了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为建模助手，将组合问题描述转换为可执行的约束模型。然而，现有的约束建模评估数据集通常局限于小规模、同质或特定领域的实例，无法反映现实世界场景的多样性。

Method: 本研究引入了一个名为CP-Bench的新基准数据集，包含从CP社区获取的各种已知组合问题类别。该数据集专门设计用于评估LLMs驱动的CP建模。通过这个数据集，研究比较了三种不同抽象层次和语法基础的约束建模系统的建模能力：高层次的MiniZinc语言、基于Python的CPMpy库以及OR-Tools CP-SAT求解器的低层次Python接口。此外，研究还系统地评估了来自现有LLM代码生成研究的基于提示和推理时间计算方法的有效性。

Result: 研究结果表明，Python-based框架提供了更方便的建模体验。同时，使用文档丰富的系统提示，结合重复采样和自我验证的方法，可以显著提高LLMs生成有效约束模型的能力，在新的具有挑战性的基准上达到了高达70%的准确率。

Conclusion: CP-Bench提供了一个多样化的基准数据集，有助于评估LLMs在约束建模中的表现。研究证明了Python-based框架的优势以及提示工程和自我验证技术对提升LLMs性能的重要性。

Abstract: Combinatorial problems are present in a wide range of industries. Constraint
Programming (CP) is a well-suited problem-solving paradigm, but its core
process, namely constraint modelling, is a bottleneck for wider adoption.
Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as modelling assistants, transforming combinatorial
problem descriptions to executable constraint models, similar to coding
assistants. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling
are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do
not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap
by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark dataset that includes a diverse set
of well-known combinatorial problem classes sourced from the CP community,
structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this
dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare
and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint
modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax: the
high-level MiniZinc language and Python-based CPMpy library, and the
lower-level Python interface of the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver. In order to enhance
the ability of LLMs to produce valid constraint models, we systematically
evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods adapted
from existing LLM-based code generation research. Our results underscore the
modelling convenience provided by Python-based frameworks, as well as the
effectiveness of documentation-rich system prompts, which, augmented with
repeated sampling and self-verification, achieve further improvements, reaching
up to 70\% accuracy on this new, highly challenging benchmark.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the large-scale itinerary planning problem, which seeks an optimal path maximizing POI scores while minimizing travel time and cost within duration constraints.

Method: Analyzes decomposability of the problem, introduces weak decomposability definition, proposes a multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm with dynamic decomposition strategy, optimization potential definition, and computational resource allocation strategy.

Result: The proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments on real-world datasets, with increasing advantages as problem scale grows.

Conclusion: Weak decomposability is key for large-scale itinerary planning, and the proposed algorithm effectively addresses challenges like component imbalance and interactions.

Abstract: Large-scale itinerary planning is a variant of the traveling salesman
problem, aiming to determine an optimal path that maximizes the collected
points of interest (POIs) scores while minimizing travel time and cost, subject
to travel duration constraints. This paper analyzes the decomposability of
large-scale itinerary planning, proving that strict decomposability is
difficult to satisfy, and introduces a weak decomposability definition based on
a necessary condition, deriving the corresponding graph structures that fulfill
this property. With decomposability guaranteed, we propose a novel
multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for large-scale itinerary
planning, addressing the challenges of component imbalance and interactions.
Specifically, we design a dynamic decomposition strategy based on the
normalized fitness within each component, define optimization potential
considering component scale and contribution, and develop a computational
resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a
set of real-world datasets. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art
multi-objective itinerary planning algorithms demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, with performance advantages increasing as the problem scale
grows.

TL;DR: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and tasks. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ICRL面临两大挑战：1）状态-动作-奖励数据的多模态特性；2）决策任务的多样性和异构性。这些限制了在RL领域中充分挖掘in-context学习的潜力。

Method: 设计T2MIR框架，用MoE替代传统前馈层，包括：1）token-wise MoE捕捉多模态输入语义；2）task-wise MoE通过对比学习优化任务路由，缓解梯度冲突。两部分输出拼接后传递到下一层。

Conclusion: T2MIR展示了MoE在ICRL中的潜力，推动其向语言和视觉领域成果靠近，代码已开源。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material
design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding
targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this
paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to
incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their

prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff
datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,
achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream

clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

### [26] [PCDVQ: Enhancing Vector Quantization for Large Language Models via Polar Coordinate Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05432)
*Yuxuan Yue,Zukang Xu,Zhihang Yuan,Dawei Yang,Jianglong Wu,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to deploy on edge devices due to their size. Vector Quantization (VQ) can help reduce this size significantly while maintaining accuracy. The paper finds that the direction of vectors is more sensitive to quantization than magnitude, and current methods focusing on reducing magnitude error lead to larger quantization errors. To address this, they propose Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector Quantization (PCDVQ), which separately quantizes direction and magnitude and optimizes codebooks accordingly. Experiments show PCDVQ improves zero-shot accuracy by at least 1.5% at 2-bit quantization compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have large parameter scales making edge deployment challenging. Traditional VQ methods quantize vectors in a coupled manner, but directions are found to be more sensitive to quantization than magnitudes. Current metrics like Euclidean distance focus on magnitude errors, causing larger overall quantization errors.

Method: The method, PCDVQ, consists of two modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD) - transforms vectors into polar coordinates and independently quantizes direction and magnitude; 2) Distribution Aligned Codebook Construction (DACC) - optimizes direction and magnitude codebooks according to the source distribution.

Result: PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods with at least 1.5% higher zero-shot accuracy at 2-bit quantization level.

Conclusion: PCDVQ presents a new paradigm for accurate and highly compressed LLMs, effectively addressing the challenges posed by the sensitivity of vector direction in quantization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

*Zikang Liu,Tongtian Yue,Yepeng Tang,Longteng Guo,Junxian Cai,Qingbin Liu,Xi Chen,Jing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prefix Grouper is an efficient GRPO training algorithm that reduces redundant prefix computation through a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy, maintaining training equivalence with standard GRPO while significantly lowering computational costs. It's fully plug-and-play and improves scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO enhances policy learning but introduces substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes due to redundant encoding for each group member, creating a bottleneck in long-context learning.

Method: The proposed Prefix Grouper employs a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy to eliminate redundant prefix computation by restructuring self-attention into two parts so the shared prefix is encoded only once. This approach preserves full differentiability and compatibility with end-to-end training.

Result: Empirical experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent results as standard GRPO while drastically reducing the computational cost of training, especially in long-prefix scenarios.

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper offers an efficient solution to the computational inefficiency of GRPO, allowing larger group sizes within the same computational budget and improving scalability for complex tasks and larger models.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now

*Thomas Massena,Léo andéol,Thibaut Boissin,Franck Mamalet,Corentin Friedrich,Mathieu Serrurier,Sébastien Gerchinovitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces lip-rcp, a method using Lipschitz-bounded networks to estimate robust CP sets efficiently and accurately for medium/large-scale problems. It outperforms current methods in set size and computational efficiency on datasets like ImageNet. The study also explores vanilla CP under attack and derives new coverage bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical conformal prediction methods fail under adversarial attacks, leading to the need for robust conformal prediction techniques that are both efficient and effective for large scale problems.

Method: Propose lip-rcp method which leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to estimate robust CP sets when combined with a 1-Lipschitz robust network. Also study vanilla CP under attack and derive worst-case coverage bounds.

Result: Lip-rcp outperforms state-of-the-art results in terms of the size of the robust CP sets and computational efficiency for medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.

Conclusion: Lip-rcp makes robust conformal prediction as efficient as vanilla CP while maintaining robustness guarantees.

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

*Manon Renault,Hamoud Younes,Hugo Tessier,Ronan Le Roy,Bastien Pasdeloup,Mathieu Léonardon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents an embedded system for monitoring reusable packages, using a 1D CNN to classify accelerometer data with high precision and reduced model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance operational efficiency and ecological sustainability by monitoring the state of reusable packages through an embedded system with a lifespan of several years.

Method: Developing a pipeline including data processing, training, and evaluation of a deep learning model (1D CNN) for classifying accelerometer data. Data augmentation techniques (SMOTE and ADASYN) are used to address dataset imbalance, followed by compression techniques to reduce model size.

Result: Achieved precision of 94.54% for one class and 95.83% for another in a two-class problem. Compression techniques decreased model size by a factor of four. The deployed model consumes 316 mW during inference.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively monitors package states with minimal power consumption, extending device lifespan and supporting sustainable operations.

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with
significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological
sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded
system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a
Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a
lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages.
Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption
of 316 mW during inference.

### [30] [An Unsupervised Framework for Dynamic Health Indicator Construction and Its Application in Rolling Bearing Prognostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05438)
*Tongda Sun,Chen Yin,Huailiang Zheng,Yining Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In order to solve the problems of traditional health indicators (HI) in rolling bearing degradation assessment and prognostics, this paper proposes a new dynamic HI construction method through an unsupervised framework. The method uses a skip-connection-based autoencoder for feature learning and an HI-generating module with temporal dependence modeling to automatically extract degradation features and construct dynamic HIs. Experiments on two datasets show that this method performs better than other comparison methods in degradation trend representation and prognostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HI construction methods mainly depend on expert knowledge for feature extraction and neglect dynamic information in the sequential degradation process, limiting their ability to represent degradation trends and perform prognostics.

Method: Firstly, raw signals are mapped to a representative degradation feature space (DFS) via a skip-connection-based autoencoder for automatic feature extraction. Then, within this DFS, an HI-generating module embedded with an inner HI-prediction block is used to construct dynamic HIs, explicitly modeling the temporal dependence between past and current HI states.

Result: The experiment results on two bearing lifecycle datasets show that the proposed HI construction method surpasses comparison methods in performance, and the constructed dynamic HI is more effective for prognostic tasks.

Conclusion: This study successfully constructs a novel dynamic HI through an unsupervised framework, which captures the inherent dynamics of the degradation process, improving the effectiveness for degradation tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics.

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and
prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have
been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction
and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation
processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend
representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

*Yiyu Lin,Yan Wang,You Zhou,Xinye Ni,Jiahui Wu,Sen Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents UniPTMs, a unified framework for predicting multi-type protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). It uses a 'Master-Slave' dual-path architecture with various innovative modules and mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, generalization, and optimization. The framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in PTM prediction across five modification types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for PTM prediction have limitations in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and architectural optimization.

Method: UniPTMs is proposed as the first unified framework for multi-type PTM prediction. It incorporates a 'Master-Slave' dual-path collaborative architecture, with the master path using a Bidirectional Gated Cross-Attention (BGCA) module and the slave path utilizing a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Additional components include a Multi-scale Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP), a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN), and a Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism. A novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function is also used to optimize feature consistency. A lightweight variant, UniPTMs-mini, is developed to balance model complexity and performance.

Result: UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art models, achieving 3.2%-11.4% increases in MCC and 4.2%-14.3% increases in AP across five modification types. It transcends the Single-Type Prediction Paradigm.

Conclusion: UniPTMs represents an advanced solution for multi-type PTM prediction, overcoming limitations of existing models through its innovative framework and mechanisms.

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

*Thanh Vinh Vo,Young Lee,Haozhe Ma,Chien Lu,Tze-Yun Leong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In reinforcement learning, hidden confounders can bias policy learning. The paper proposes DoSAC which corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention estimation and outperforms baselines under confounded settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can lead to biased policy learning in reinforcement learning, resulting in suboptimal or non-generalizable behavior.

Method: Propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention estimation using the backdoor criterion and a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor.

Result: Empirical results on continuous control benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings, with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

Conclusion: DoSAC is a promising approach to address the issue of hidden confounders in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

### [33] [Training Dynamics Underlying Language Model Scaling Laws: Loss Deceleration and Zero-Sum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05447)
*Andrei Mircea,Supriyo Chakraborty,Nima Chitsazan,Irina Rish,Ekaterina Lobacheva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores how scaling impacts the training dynamics of language models, identifying a phenomenon called loss deceleration and attributing it to zero-sum learning (ZSL). Scaling up mitigates this issue, offering insights into improving language models beyond just increasing scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind the improvements in language models when they are scaled up, particularly focusing on the training dynamics.

Method: Investigating the occurrence of loss deceleration in language model training and its mitigation through scaling up. Attributing this deceleration to zero-sum learning (ZSL), where per-example gradients become opposed leading to destructive interference.

Result: Scaling up the model decreases the loss at which deceleration occurs and improves the log-log rate of loss improvement after deceleration. This provides new insights into language model scaling laws.

Conclusion: Loss deceleration and ZSL offer new perspectives on language model training dynamics and could be directly targeted to enhance language models without solely relying on scaling.

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss
deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying
language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to
improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts

*Liang Zhang,Bingcong Li,Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil,Sewoong Oh,Michael Muehlebach,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores zeroth-order optimization methods in machine learning, focusing on their implicit regularization and tendency towards flat minima solutions with small Hessian trace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zeroth-order methods are crucial in various machine learning applications due to the difficulty or cost of computing gradients. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the implicit regularization that affects which solutions these methods converge to.

Method: The authors use the standard two-point estimator in zeroth-order optimization and analyze its behavior. They examine how this method favors solutions with a small trace of Hessian, linking it to the concept of flat minima versus sharp minima.

Result: The study provides convergence rates for zeroth-order optimization towards approximate flat minima in convex and smooth functions. It supports the idea that such methods inherently prefer solutions characterized by a smaller Hessian trace.

Conclusion: This work highlights the implicit regularization effect of zeroth-order optimization methods, showing they favor flat minima. Experimental results from binary classification tasks and language model fine-tuning validate the theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of selecting among multiple heuristics for Metrical Task Systems (MTS) in an online setting, achieving a regret bound and providing a matching lower bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently handle metrical task systems by leveraging different heuristics tailored to various input types while minimizing regret compared to the best heuristic in hindsight.

Method: Design an algorithm that selects actions from available heuristics at each time step without knowing their costs unless they were chosen previously, achieving a specific regret bound.

Result: Achieved regret of $O(	ext{OPT}^{2/3})$ with a proven tight lower bound based on prior work.

Conclusion: Successfully developed an approach for online MTS heuristic selection with theoretically grounded performance guarantees.

Abstract: We consider the following problem: We are given $\ell$ heuristics for
Metrical Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type
of input instances. While processing an input instance received online, we are
allowed to query the action of only one of the heuristics at each time step.
Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to the best of the given
heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting comes from the fact that the
cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated unless the same
heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit Learning
against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to achieve
regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
construction of Dekel et al. (2013).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores two methods of embedding prior knowledge into neural networks for subsurface property inversion using FWI, finding that denormalization outperforms pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate the influence of two ways of initial model incorporation (pretraining and denormalization) in neural network reparameterized FWI.

Method: Investigates pretraining, which regulates neural network parameters by fitting the initial velocity model, and denormalization, which adds network outputs directly to initial models without pretraining.

Result: Denormalization simplifies workflows, accelerates convergence, and enhances inversion accuracy compared with pretraining. Pretraining leads to a complex workflow and inconsistency of objective functions.

Conclusion: Denormalization is preferable over pretraining for embedding prior knowledge in neural network reparameterized FWI.

Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion
(FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can
invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable
neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model
directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the
initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization.
Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the
initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the
network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we
systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model
incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that
pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant
velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex
workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process,
causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity.
Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows,
accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with
pretraining.

*Sima Noorani,Shayan Kiyani,George Pappas,Hamed Hassani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a novel framework for uncertainty quantification in generative AI models like LLMs. It explores CP in a query-only setting, balancing coverage, test-time query budget, and informativeness. The method uses principles from the classical missing mass problem, introducing an optimal query policy and mapping strategy. Experiments on real-world tasks with LLMs demonstrate CPQ's effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal prediction methods primarily focus on structured outputs through regression and classification, utilizing geometric distances or softmax scores. However, these methods are not well-suited for generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs) where outputs are vast, variable, and often under-specified. This necessitates a new approach to uncertainty quantification that can handle unstructured data effectively.

Method: The authors introduce CPQ, which operates in a query-only setting. The method involves two key principles: an optimal query policy based on the derivative of the missing mass and an optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets using Good-Turing estimators. These principles help manage the trade-off between coverage, test-time query budget, and informativeness.

Result: Through fine-grained experiments on three real-world open-ended tasks using two LLMs, the authors show that CPQ is applicable to any black-box LLM. They highlight the individual contributions of each principle to CPQ's performance and demonstrate that CPQ produces significantly more informative prediction sets compared to existing conformal methods.

Conclusion: CPQ provides a principled way to perform uncertainty quantification for generative AI models in high-stakes applications. By leveraging the classical missing mass problem, it achieves an optimal balance between coverage, query budget, and informativeness, making it a promising tool for enhancing the safety of LLMs.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the
\emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the
generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We
first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary
in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We
then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an
agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge
of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate
Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several
examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias),
and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).

### [39] [Geometric and Physical Constraints Synergistically Enhance Neural PDE Surrogates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05513)
*Yunfei Huang,David S. Greenberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural PDE surrogates with physical and symmetry constraints improve accuracy and generalization for CFD problems, especially on staggered grids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural PDE surrogates have potential to enhance cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical solvers, but suffer from poor generalization and error accumulation over time. Existing methods imposing physical and symmetry constraints are incompatible with staggered grids used in computational fluid dynamics.

Method: Develop novel input and output layers respecting physical laws and symmetries on staggered grids. Systematically investigate individual and combined effects of these constraints on accuracy of PDE surrogates, focusing on shallow water equations and decaying incompressible turbulence.

Result: Symmetries and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks, architectures, prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network sizes. Symmetries more effective than physical constraints; best results achieved when both are applied together.

Conclusion: Doubly-constrained surrogates generalize better to unseen initial conditions and durations, accurately predict real-world ocean currents.

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical
solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate
errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in
closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these
inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in
computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers
that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the
first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and
in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two
challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and
decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries
and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,
architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network
sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates
with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or
pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.
Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and
durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict
real-world ocean currents.

Conclusion: TimeMCL is an efficient method for predicting diverse time series futures, related to its implicit quantization objective, and shows potential for further development and application.

Abstract: We introduce TimeMCL, a method leveraging the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL)

employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All

### [41] [On Fitting Flow Models with Large Sinkhorn Couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05526)
*Michal Klein,Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini,Stephen Zhang,Marco Cuturi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the benefits of increasing batch size n by three to four orders of magnitude and carefully examines the effect of entropic regularization ε in the Sinkhorn algorithm for training flow models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, which can lead to a highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem.

Method: The method involves using new scale invariant quantities to report the sharpness of a coupling and sharded computations across multiple GPU or GPU nodes to scale up n. It also carefully examines the effect of the entropic regularization ε used in the Sinkhorn algorithm.

Result: In both synthetic and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization ε.

Conclusion: Increasing the batch size n significantly and using low entropic regularization ε in the Sinkhorn algorithm can greatly improve the performance of flow models.

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto
another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent
velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target
points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training
flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing
exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much
harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points
independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to
train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would
greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal
transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a
highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In
practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and
$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.
These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered
OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the
Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.
Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits
of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully
on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn
algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to
report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across
multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic
and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large
Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

*Snir Hordan,Maya Bechler-Speicher,Gur Lifshitz,Nadav Dym*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral features are integrated into GNNs to boost their expressive power, but current evaluation frameworks offer limited insight. This paper introduces a new expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs based on eigenvalue multiplicity, proves many SGNNs' incompleteness, and proposes a method to improve expressivity which is empirically verified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and enhance the expressive power of Spectrally-enhanced Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), given the limitations of current evaluation frameworks like k-WL graph isomorphism test and homomorphism counting.

Method: Develop an expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs using the largest eigenvalue multiplicity for graph classification. Prove the incompleteness of many SGNNs even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. Adapt rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to improve SGNNs' expressivity.

Result: Theoretically proved the incompleteness of several SGNNs and demonstrated via experiments on MNIST Superpixel dataset for image classification and eigenvector canonicalization on graphs from ZINC that the proposed method can provably improve SGNNs' expressivity.

Conclusion: Introduced a novel expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs based on eigenvalue multiplicity, identified deficiencies in current SGNNs, and provided a method to enhance their expressivity which was supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results.

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among
non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian
eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The
expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated
via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,
these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight
into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of
classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an
expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete
even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt
rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a
method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We
empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification
experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on
graphs from ZINC.

Motivation: Deepfake technology poses security challenges by enabling misinformation campaigns on social media. Existing detection frameworks have difficulty distinguishing between benign and adversarial deepfakes.

Method: The method involves creating SocialDF, a dataset with high-fidelity deepfakes from various online sources, and developing a novel LLM-based multi-factor detection approach that combines facial recognition, speech transcription, and multi-agent LLM pipeline for cross-verifying audio-visual cues.

Conclusion: SocialDF and the LLM-based multi-factor detection approach provide a significant advancement in addressing real-world deepfake challenges on social media platforms.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved
the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security
challenges. While deepfake technology has valuable applications in
entertainment and accessibility, it has emerged as a potent vector for
misinformation campaigns, particularly on social media. Existing detection
frameworks struggle to distinguish between benign and adversarially generated
deepfakes engineered to manipulate public perception. To address this
challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world
deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses
high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad
coverage of manipulative techniques. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-factor
detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech
transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual
cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques
that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively

<details>

Conclusion: Agentomics-ML是一种全自动代理系统，能够生成分类模型并实现可重复的训练和推理。它在计算生物学数据集上表现优异，特别是在泛化能力和成功率方面，为全自动系统在这一领域的应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has
revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics,
transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The
increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets
demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models.
Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for
automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However,
when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods
struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce
Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a
classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and
inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation
process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete
individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics
provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as
overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations,
suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model
architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on
several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that
it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both
generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain
experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational
biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully
autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used
benchmark datasets. The code is available at

*Arian Raje,Baris Askin,Divyansh Jhunjhunwala,Gauri Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ravan is an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity for federated fine-tuning of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have not effectively leveraged edge-device data yet. Federated learning offers a way to collaboratively fine-tune these models without transferring private data, but existing methods suffer from accuracy degradation due to data heterogeneity across clients.

Method: Propose Ravan, which reparameterizes weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads with only core matrices and scaling factors trained. The trainable scaling factors allow focusing on useful heads and recover higher-rank approximation without increasing communicated parameters.

Result: Experiments show Ravan improves test accuracy by 2-8% over prior baselines in vision and language benchmarks.

Conclusion: Ravan is a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning of large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast
amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising
paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

*Chase Goddard,Lindsay M. Smith,Vudtiwat Ngampruetikorn,David J. Schwab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-context learning (ICL) in pretrained transformers is explored, focusing on the role of task diversity in the pretraining distribution for out-of-distribution generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize out-of-distribution, particularly emphasizing task diversity beyond just the number of distinct tasks.

Method: Empirical investigation into ICL emergence in transformers trained on linear functions with varying task diversity. Study includes analysis of solutions learned by transformers and their generalization capabilities, as well as constructing a phase diagram for task diversity and examining influences of model depth and regression problem dimensionality.

Result: As task diversity increases, transformers transition from specialized solutions that exhibit ICL within the pretraining task distribution to solutions that generalize out-of-distribution to the entire task space. Similar transitions are observed in nonlinear regression problems.

Conclusion: Task diversity plays a crucial role in the emergence and generalization of ICL in transformers, interacting with factors like the number of pretraining tasks, model depth, and problem dimensionality.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained
transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only
a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the
pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize
\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct
tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of
task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear
functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a
transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the
pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of
distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the
solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and
observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a
phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with
the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as
the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem
influence the transition.

TL;DR: MOSAIC is an agentic algorithm enabling multiple agents to independently solve tasks while sharing and reusing knowledge without coordination, showing greater sample efficiency and collaborative learning dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of scalability, open-endedness, and beneficial collaborative learning dynamics in decentralized agentic AI systems.

Method: MOSAIC combines three mechanisms: modular policy composition via neural network masks, cosine similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and asynchronous communication and policy integration.

Result: MOSAIC demonstrates greater sample efficiency than isolated learners, learns faster, and can solve tasks that isolated learners cannot. It also results in the emergence of ideal curricula of tasks from easy to hard.

Conclusion: Collaborative learning in agentic systems can lead to better and continuously evolving performance at both individual and collective levels.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一致性预测在存在分布偏移时，其覆盖保证通常会失效，特别是在测试环境中子群体混合未知且不同于校准数据时。

Method: 提出了新的算法，可以有效适应子群体偏移，确保有效的覆盖范围，而无需明确了解子群体结构。这些算法可扩展到高维设置，并在现实机器学习任务中表现良好。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，所提出的方法在标准一致性预测失败的情况下，能够可靠地维持覆盖范围并控制风险。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了子群体偏移问题，增强了在真实世界应用场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard
conformal prediction fails.

Motivation: To address the limitation of existing methods like TabPFN which struggle with large and complex datasets.

Method: Incorporating linear attention mechanisms into the model to replace complexity-quadratic self-attention, resulting in TabFlex which is designed to handle large-scale tabular data efficiently.

Result: TabFlex achieves over 2x speedup compared to TabPFN and 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25 baselines in efficiency across various datasets. It processes a million-sample dataset in just 5 seconds.

Conclusion: TabFlex is highly effective for large-scale datasets, offering strong performance with reduced computational costs, especially when paired with techniques like dimensionality reduction and data sampling.

Abstract: Leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for tabular classification has gained significant attention for its
training-free adaptability across diverse datasets. Recent advancements, like
TabPFN, excel in small-scale tabular datasets but struggle to scale for large

TabPFN for larger datasets by incorporating linear attention mechanisms as a
scalable alternative to complexity-quadratic self-attention. Our model,
TabFlex, efficiently handles tabular datasets with thousands of features and
hundreds of classes, scaling seamlessly to millions of samples. For instance,
TabFlex processes the poker-hand dataset with over a million samples in just 5
seconds. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a
2x speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25
tested baselines in terms of efficiency across a diverse range of datasets.
Furthermore, TabFlex remains highly effective on large-scale datasets,
delivering strong performance with significantly reduced computational costs,
especially when combined with data-efficient techniques such as dimensionality
reduction and data sampling.

TL;DR: This paper proposes CoFrNet, a novel neural architecture inspired by continued fractions in number theory. CoFrNets are efficiently trainable and interpretable, proven to be universal approximators via a new strategy not relying on infinite width or depth. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate their strong modeling capability, interpretability, and competitiveness with state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the lack of research on building interpretable neural architectures compared to local post hoc explanations for neural networks. The authors aim to create a model that is both interpretable and powerful in representation.

Method: CoFrNet is a new neural architecture based on the form of continued fractions. It can be trained efficiently and interpreted due to its functional form. The paper proves CoFrNets are universal approximators using a different strategy than typical neural network proofs which rely on infinite width or depth.

Result: CoFrNets accurately model nonlinear synthetic functions, estimate feature attributions, and sometimes higher order terms. On seven real datasets (tabular, text, image), CoFrNets perform comparably or better than other interpretable models and multilayer perceptrons, sometimes approaching state-of-the-art accuracies.

Conclusion: CoFrNets provide a powerful and interpretable alternative to existing neural network architectures, demonstrating strong performance across various types of data.

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: 本研究澄清了逆折叠模型的自由能基础，提出了改进零样本稳定性预测的途径，并通过实验证明了这些方法的有效性。

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

Time series data has low per-timestep information density and complex dependencies, necessitating a model that can handle structured variable interactions effectively.

Method: The paper proposes FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal Transformer. It incorporates dynamic, symmetric cross-channel interactions via a low-rank Factorization Machine into patch embeddings using a learnable gating mechanism. It also encodes static and dynamic covariates for multivariate conditioning.

Result: FaCTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks for both short-term and long-term horizons. The largest variant uses only about 400K parameters, making it 50 times smaller than competitive baselines. Additionally, its design allows for interpretability through cross-channel influence scores.

Conclusion: FaCTR provides a compact, efficient, and interpretable solution for time series forecasting, supporting self-supervised pretraining and serving as a versatile foundation for downstream time series tasks.

Abstract: While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically
rich and exhibit univariate dependency structures-their architectural
complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series
data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex
dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on
structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and
overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal
Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic,
symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization
Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable
gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for
multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning
both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to
only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal
transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables
interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential
requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports
self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile
foundation for downstream time series tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MaxEnt RL is effective but can fail in performance-critical control problems due to misleading policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why MaxEnt RL struggles with performance-critical control problems despite its success in many RL tasks.

Method: Analyze the trade-off between robustness and optimality in MaxEnt algorithms through experiments on a variety of control problems.

Result: Demonstrated that entropy maximization can mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in tasks requiring precise, low-entropy policies.

Conclusion: Better understanding of balancing reward design and entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积映射的奇异值编码了有趣的谱特性，这些特性可用于改进卷积神经网络的泛化和鲁棒性、促进模型压缩。然而，传统奇异值计算方法要么资源消耗过大（如直接展开矩阵法），要么效率受限（如FFT方法）。

Method: 提出了一种基于局部傅里叶分析的算法，其复杂度为O(N)，并利用了卷积算子的平移不变性，从而能够更高效地计算奇异值及其对应的奇异向量。

Result: 理论分析表明该算法运行时效率高，数值实验验证了其有效性。结果表明，该方法具有可扩展性，并能实际应用于高维卷积映射的奇异值计算。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，用于计算高维卷积映射的所有奇异值及其对应奇异向量，解决了现有方法在大规模输入和多通道情况下的局限性。

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

*Xiaohua Lu,Liubov Tupikina,Mehwish Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper conducts a comprehensive review of methods for handling n-ary relational data using knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs, proposing a two-dimensional taxonomy and discussing datasets, negative sampling strategies, and future research challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of traditional knowledge graphs which reduce complex n-ary relations to simple triples, leading to loss of higher-order relational details. Hypergraphs are introduced as they naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, but often overlook entity roles. Thus, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs are explored to better capture complex structures and role-specific semantics.

Method: A two-dimensional taxonomy is proposed. The first dimension categorizes models based on methodology into translation-based, tensor factorisation-based, deep neural network-based, logic rules-based, and hyperedge expansion-based models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of entity roles and positions in n-ary relations into aware-less, position-aware, and role-aware approaches.

Result: The survey successfully provides a comprehensive review of methods handling n-ary relational data and proposes an effective taxonomy. It also discusses existing datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outlines open challenges for future research.

Conclusion: Knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational knowledge graphs offer significant advantages in capturing complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world knowledge compared to traditional knowledge graphs. This survey provides a foundation for future advancements in this area.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a
form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources
into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to
simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,
hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly
connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning
often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic
modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to
better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world
knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling
n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first
dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,
translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural
network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based
models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of
entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,
position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing
datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire
future research.

*Jiri Navratil,Jarret Ross,Payel Das,Youssef Mroueh,Samuel C Hoffman,Vijil Chenthamarakshan,Brian Belgodere*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An efficient training-free method GP-MoLFormer-Sim is introduced for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM). It uses molecular similarity to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy. When combined with a genetic algorithm (GA), it outperforms existing training-free baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing molecules while preserving similarity to a target molecule or property is essential in drug discovery, chemical design, and biology.

Method: The method leverages contextual representations learned from a CLM to estimate molecular similarity and adjusts the autoregressive sampling strategy accordingly. It tracks the distance of current generations from the target and updates logits to encourage similarity preservation.

Result: GP-MoLFormer-Sim combined with GA outperforms existing training-free baseline methods on molecular optimization benchmarks when the oracle remains black-box.

Conclusion: This work advances understanding and guidance of generative mechanisms in CLMs.

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

*Joseph Rowan,Buu Phan,Ashish Khisti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method extending Gumbel-max sampling for coupling probability distributions, establishes a lower bound on acceptance probability (list matching lemma), and applies this setup to multi-draft speculative sampling and distributed lossy compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient way of coupling probability distributions by relaxing the problem and proposing an extended version of Gumbel-max sampling. This leads to applications in multi-draft speculative sampling and distributed lossy compression.

Method: The method involves generating a list of samples from one distribution and declaring an accept if any sample matches that generated from another distribution. A novel extension of Gumbel-max sampling is proposed and a lower bound on acceptance probability (list matching lemma) is established.

Result: The new mechanism achieves competitive performance with existing baselines in multi-draft speculative sampling while ensuring drafter invariance. In distributed lossy compression, it shows significant gains in experiments with synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a relaxation technique for coupling probability distributions with theoretical guarantees, leading to practical applications in language tasks and data compression.

Abstract: We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions --
a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared
if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other
distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends
the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for
coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower
bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We
next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism
for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves
performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a
range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter
invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing
schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level
acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed
lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is
compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side
information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our
generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant
gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image
dataset.

*Saeed Hedayatian,Stefanos Nikolaidis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms usually depend on hand-crafted behavioral descriptors. This paper presents AutoQD, which automatically generates behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies in Markov Decision Processes using random Fourier features. Proven theoretically, the embeddings converge to true MMD distances with more sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions. Experiments show that AutoQD can discover diverse policies without predefined behavioral descriptors in continuous control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of relying on hand-crafted behavioral descriptors in QD algorithms, which constrain exploration to predefined notions of diversity. By automatically generating these descriptors, the method aims to discover more diverse solutions without domain-specific knowledge.

Method: AutoQD leverages random Fourier features to approximate Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy occupancy measures. The approach involves creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful behavioral differences, then projecting them into a low-dimensional space for use as behavioral descriptors in QD methods. It proves that these embeddings converge to true MMD distances with increasing samples and dimensions.

Result: Through experiments in multiple continuous control tasks, AutoQD successfully discovers diverse policies without predefined behavioral descriptors, presenting an alternative to prior methods in unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization.

Conclusion: AutoQD provides a well-motivated alternative to existing methods by enabling the discovery of diverse policies without requiring domain-specific knowledge or predefined behavioral descriptors, opening new possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery.

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

TL;DR: The paper presents a Bayesian framework that minimizes human expert queries by leveraging pre-trained classifiers' probability estimates, achieving cost reductions in querying experts while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the reliance on human expert queries for classification tasks while maintaining prediction accuracy.

Method: A general Bayesian framework is developed to model expert correlation through joint latent representation. It allows simulation-based inference about the utility of additional expert queries and posterior distributions over unobserved expert labels.

Result: Significant reductions in the cost of querying human experts were achieved compared to baselines, while maintaining high prediction accuracy on real-world medical classification problems, CIFAR-10H, and ImageNet-16H.

Conclusion: The proposed Bayesian framework effectively leverages pre-trained classifiers and reduces the need for human expert queries, providing a cost-efficient solution for classification tasks.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning often involve making predictions based on
both model outputs and the opinions of human experts. In this context, we
investigate the problem of querying experts for class label predictions, using
as few human queries as possible, and leveraging the class probability
estimates of pre-trained classifiers. We develop a general Bayesian framework
for this problem, modeling expert correlation via a joint latent
representation, enabling simulation-based inference about the utility of
additional expert queries, as well as inference of posterior distributions over
unobserved expert labels. We apply our approach to two real-world medical
classification problems, as well as to CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H,
demonstrating substantial reductions relative to baselines in the cost of
querying human experts while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代基础模型（FMs）虽然功能强大，但其训练数据广泛、计算成本高，难以在大多数消费设备上运行。此外，这些模型中的大量知识可能与具体任务无关。因此，研究者希望开发一种技术，能够利用更小的模型捕捉执行特定任务所需的知识。

Method: 研究者探索了一种技术，即将大型Transformer的参数映射到较小的专用模型参数，并使这种转换针对特定任务进行优化，从而让小模型能够捕获执行该任务所需的狭窄知识范围。

Result: 在图像建模任务上的研究表明，生成的小模型性能超过了通用条件模型。

Conclusion: 这种方法可以有效减少计算成本，同时保持或提高特定任务的性能，为在资源受限环境中使用基础模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Motivation: 现有归因方法通常将网络参数视为统一整体，未考虑不同层编码不同类型信息的问题，这可能导致归因不够准确。

Method: 提出一种新方法，通过学习针对归因的参数重要性权重，使归因过程适应模型结构，无需使用标签数据，能够捕捉训练样本对输出特定语义方面的贡献。

Result: 该方法在扩散模型中提高了归因准确性，并能提供关于输出如何从训练数据中借用信息的细粒度见解。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可以更准确地识别哪些训练样本对给定输出影响最大，特别是在生成模型中，能更好地理解输出与训练数据之间的关系。

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

TL;DR: BAQ is a novel framework for allocating quantization bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy, achieving up to 56× lower perplexity than GPTQ in large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training model quantization can reduce the memory and computational costs of LLMs. But existing methods fail to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization noise due to uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments.

Method: A new framework proposes assumptions that allow layer/component-wise loss function as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This turns the bit allocation problem into a convex optimization task with closed-form solution adapting precision across weights to minimize layer-wise quantization loss.

Result: Experimental results show BAQ outperforms GPTQ by achieving up to 56× lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters.

Conclusion: BAQ achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity, and provides a theoretical explanation for its observed gains.

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this

Conclusion: This approach aims to establish technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware, privacy-preserving intelligence in next-generation XR systems.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative
interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated

through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated

different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the

Abstract: Membership inference tests aim to determine whether a particular data point
was included in a language model's training set. However, recent works have
shown that such tests often fail under the strict definition of membership
based on exact matching, and have suggested relaxing this definition to include
semantic neighbors as members as well. In this work, we show that membership
inference tests are still unreliable under this relaxation - it is possible to
poison the training dataset in a way that causes the test to produce incorrect
predictions for a target point. We theoretically reveal a trade-off between a
test's accuracy and its robustness to poisoning. We also present a concrete
instantiation of this poisoning attack and empirically validate its
effectiveness. Our results show that it can degrade the performance of existing
tests to well below random.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (DSD), a high-quality dataset with about 10,610 images and multi-tier annotations, marking a shift from model-centric to data-centric approach in AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of the traditional 'Model Centric' approach and emphasize the importance of quality, structure, and relevance of training data as key drivers of model performance.

Method: Introduced DSD, a dataset with high-quality human peer-ranked photography images and extensive multi-tier annotations, representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's large image catalog.

Result: Quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models against known benchmarks were documented. The code and trained models used in evaluation are made publicly available.

Conclusion: DSD is designed to set a new standard for commercial image datasets and provide a scalable foundation for robust commercial and multimodal AI development.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components are crucial for modeling flow dynamics.

Method: The method involves proposing a novel framework combining 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and 2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to be consistent with natural laws.

Result: Evaluations on two real-world directed graph data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.

Conclusion: This novel framework helps GNNs be sensitive to high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture detailed topological differences.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency
components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components
are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends
to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs
sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture
detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that
combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and
2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to
be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph
data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for systematic characterization of the strengths and limitations of sequence modeling architectures in capturing diverse temporal dependencies inherent in sequential data.

Method: Propose a synthetic benchmarking framework where synthetic targets are generated, each characterized by a memory function and a parameter that determines the strength of temporal dependence. This allows for a continuum of tasks varying in temporal complexity to analyze model behavior concerning specific memory properties.

Result: Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures confirm existing theoretical insights and reveal new findings about the effectiveness of different models in capturing distinct temporal structures.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective in advancing theoretical understanding of sequence models and highlights the importance of using controllable targets with clearly defined structures for evaluating these architectures.

Abstract: The evolution of sequence modeling architectures, from recurrent neural
networks and convolutional models to Transformers and structured state-space
models, reflects ongoing efforts to address the diverse temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. Despite this progress, systematically
characterizing the strengths and limitations of these architectures remains a
fundamental challenge.In this work, we propose a synthetic benchmarking
framework to evaluate how effectively different sequence models capture
distinct temporal structures. The core of this approach is to generate
synthetic targets, each characterized by a memory function and a parameter that
determines the strength of temporal dependence. This setup allows us to produce
a continuum of tasks that vary in temporal complexity, enabling fine-grained
analysis of model behavior concerning specific memory properties. We focus on
four representative memory functions, each corresponding to a distinct class of
temporal structures.Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures
confirm existing theoretical insights and reveal new findings.These results

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ManGO is a new framework that optimizes complex systems using pre-collected datasets, outperforming existing methods in diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing complex systems is crucial but challenging due to unknown rules and high evaluation costs. Offline optimization needs improvement as conventional approaches may fail beyond training data.

Method: ManGO learns the design-score manifold using a diffusion-based framework, unifying forward prediction and backward generation with derivative-free guidance and adaptive inference-time scaling.

Result: ManGO surpasses 24 single- and 10 multi-objective optimization methods in various domains such as synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world engineering optimization.

Conclusion: ManGO provides a powerful tool for offline optimization by capturing design-score interdependencies and generalizing beyond training data.

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.

TL;DR: 为了应对数据隐私和安全的挑战，本文提出了Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM)框架，用于评估机器遗忘的有效性。IAM通过量化样本级别的遗忘完整性，解决了现有方法计算成本高以及难以捕捉近似遗忘细微变化的问题。实验表明IAM在精确和近似遗忘的二元包含测试中表现出色，并揭示了过度遗忘和遗忘不足的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对数据隐私和安全的关注增加，机器遗忘（即从训练模型中移除特定数据影响而不进行完全重新训练）变得越来越重要。然而，现有的评估方法如成员推断攻击（MIAs）存在计算资源需求过高以及难以捕捉近似遗忘细微变化的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM)的新框架。该框架通过插值模型在查询样本上的泛化-拟合行为差距来量化样本级别的遗忘完整性。IAM仅需一个预训练的阴影模型即可扩展到大型语言模型（LLMs）。

Result: IAM在精确遗忘的二元包含测试中表现良好，并且与近似遗忘具有高度相关性。此外，IAM揭示了近似遗忘算法中存在的过度遗忘和遗忘不足的一般风险。

Conclusion: IAM为评估机器遗忘提供了一个高效且强大的工具，强调了在近似遗忘系统中需要更强的安全保障。代码已开源。

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This position paper argues for the underdeveloped post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing frameworks to ensure reliability and safety. It suggests framing changes in data and model performance degradation as statistical hypothesis testing problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is that only 9% of FDA-registered AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan, and existing monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate.

Method: The method proposed in this paper is to ground post-deployment monitoring in label-efficient and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative to current practices. Specifically, detection of changes in the data and model performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis testing problems.

Result: Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of clinical AI systems.

Conclusion: Post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI should be grounded in label-efficient and statistically valid testing frameworks, opening new research directions for the technical community.

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically

*Chaofan Pan,Jiafen Liu,Yanhua Li,Linbo Xiong,Fan Min,Wei Wei,Xin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Continual Learning with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), a new problem where an agent must generalize policies across varying action spaces. It proposes the Action-Adaptive Continual Learning framework (AACL) that builds an action representation space and fine-tunes it for each new action space to maintain stability and plasticity. The authors also introduce a benchmark for CL-DC and show AACL outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual learning methods assume static capabilities in dynamic environments, which is not reflective of real-world scenarios where agent capabilities can change dynamically. This necessitates a solution for policy generalization across different action spaces.

Method: The Action-Adaptive Continual Learning (AACL) framework decouples the agent's policy from specific action spaces by constructing an action representation space. For each new action space, the encoder-decoder of action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to balance stability and plasticity.

Result: Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms popular methods in generalizing policies across various action spaces.

Conclusion: The study concludes by introducing a new problem, CL-DC, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the AACL framework through experiments and a newly released benchmark.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

*Xiucheng Wang,Honggang Jia,Nan Cheng,Dusit Niyato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel semantic communication framework using generative AI, specifically diffusion models, is proposed. It provides a theoretical foundation for mitigating noise in semantic representations, derives an optimal relationship for diffusion parameters, and introduces a scaling mechanism to handle distribution mismatches. A latent diffusion model-based transceiver is developed that is training-free at inference time, offering modularity and compatibility with large-scale pretrained models. Experiments show superior performance over traditional methods, especially under low SNR conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust semantic communication system that can effectively mitigate noise in semantic representations and handle distributional shifts without requiring extensive model fine-tuning.

Method: The method involves establishing a theoretical foundation based on stochastic differential equations to explain the denoising properties of diffusion models. An analytical relationship between SNR and denoising timestep is derived to optimize diffusion parameters. A scaling mechanism is introduced to address distribution mismatches. The architecture uses a variational autoencoder for compression and a pretrained diffusion model as a universal denoiser.

Result: The proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines, particularly excelling in low SNR conditions and when dealing with distributional shifts.

Conclusion: The novel semantic communication framework demonstrates promising potential for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission in future 6G systems, supporting zero-shot generalization and effectively handling out-of-distribution inputs.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging
the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation
is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which
elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a
closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion
parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution
mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a
mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust
performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.
Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model
(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is
employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a
universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free
at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale
pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and
mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,
particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby
establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission
in future 6G systems.

TL;DR: CoTo 是一种渐进式训练策略，通过逐步增加适配器的激活概率，改善 LoRA 方法中适配器优化过程中的问题。它提高了单任务性能、多任务合并准确性、剪枝鲁棒性并减少了训练开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA 是一种高效的微调技术，但其适配器容易陷入次优解，限制了模型泛化能力及下游操作（如适配器合并和剪枝）。

Method: 提出 CoTo 策略，通过在微调过程中逐渐增加适配器的激活概率，随机停用适配器，以实现更平衡的优化和对损失函数空间更广泛的探索。理论分析表明 CoTo 促进了逐层 dropout 的稳定性及线性模式连通性，并采用合作博弈方法量化每个适配器的边际贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明 CoTo 持续提升了单任务性能、增强了多任务合并精度、改进了剪枝鲁棒性并降低了训练开销，同时与多种 LoRA 变体兼容。

Conclusion: CoTo 是一种有效的训练策略，能够显著改善基于 LoRA 的模型微调效果，提升模型性能和效率。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading parameter-efficient
fine-tuning technique for adapting large foundation models, yet it often locks
adapters into suboptimal minima near their initialization. This hampers model
generalization and limits downstream operators such as adapter merging and
pruning. Here, we propose CoTo, a progressive training strategy that gradually
increases adapters' activation probability over the course of fine-tuning. By
stochastically deactivating adapters, CoTo encourages more balanced
optimization and broader exploration of the loss landscape. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that CoTo promotes layer-wise dropout stability
and linear mode connectivity, and we adopt a cooperative-game approach to
quantify each adapter's marginal contribution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoTo consistently boosts single-task performance, enhances
multi-task merging accuracy, improves pruning robustness, and reduces training
overhead, all while remaining compatible with diverse LoRA variants. Code is

TL;DR: An novel algorithm EEDQN is proposed to stabilize algorithmic performance in deep reinforcement learning by addressing overestimation bias and improving sample efficiency. It outperforms baseline DQN methods in MinAtar environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand how different improvements in Deep Q-Networks interact, particularly focusing on reducing overestimation bias and enhancing sample efficiency.

Method: Introduction of Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN) which combines ensembles with elastic step updates. This method was tested against standard and ensemble DQN variants across the MinAtar benchmark.

Result: EEDQN shows consistently robust performance across all tested environments, surpassing baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art ensemble DQNs in final returns on most MinAtar environments.

Conclusion: Systematically combining algorithmic improvements, like ensemble and multi-step methods, can lead to significant gains in deep reinforcement learning.

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when
carefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.

*Pascal Jr Tikeng Notsawo,Guillaume Dumas,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking, a delayed generalization following overfitting in neural networks, can be induced by explicit or implicit regularization. This work shows that gradient descent with small non-zero regularization leads to grokking when a model with property P (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) exists. Over-parameterization allows grokking without explicit regularization and data selection alone can amplify grokking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the conditions under which grokking occurs and demonstrate that it can be induced by both explicit and implicit regularization methods.

Method: Demonstrating that when there is a model with property P that generalizes on a problem, applying gradient descent with small non-zero regularization of P results in grokking. Analyzing the effects of over-parameterization and different types of regularization on grokking.

Result: Grokking can be induced by explicit or implicit regularization. Over-parameterization facilitates grokking without explicit regularization. The l2 norm is not always a reliable indicator of generalization when regularizing towards a different property P. Data selection alone can amplify grokking.

Conclusion: This study extends the understanding of grokking by showing its connection to various forms of regularization, over-parameterization, and data selection.

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

*Dumindu Tissera,Omar Awadallah,Muhammad Umair Danish,Ayan Sadhu,Katarina Grolinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a redesigned MLC loss function that addresses the challenge of large negative data in multi-label classification by introducing an any-class presence likelihood and a regularization parameter, improving MLC performance without additional parameters or computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label classification applications often encounter large amounts of negative data which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder accurate identification and classification of positive instances.

Method: Redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a likelihood of any class being present using a normalized weighted geometric mean of predicted class probabilities. Introduce a regularization parameter to control absent class probabilities contribution in positive instances.

Result: Experiments on datasets with negative data (SewerML, modified COCO, ChestX-ray14) demonstrate consistent improvements over standard loss functions with gains up to 6.01 pp in F1, 8.06 in F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision.

Conclusion: The proposed loss functions improve multi-label classification performance effectively without adding parameters or computational complexity.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

Motivation: Real-world data streams are inherently non-stationary due to concept drift, which poses challenges for adaptive learning systems. Existing methods fail to address the co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited supervision and persistent uncertainty.

Method: The paper formalizes Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD) and proposes the Calibrated Source-Free Adaptation (CSFA) framework. CSFA includes a training-free prototype calibration mechanism and a source-free adaptation algorithm called Reliable Surrogate Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSFA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of performance and effectiveness in open-world streaming scenarios.

Conclusion: CSFA establishes a unified framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in open-world streaming scenarios, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior
performance and effectiveness of CSFA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

*Rudransh Agnihotri,Ananya Pandey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过结合提示工程和微小的LoRA调整，提出了一种成本效益高、透明且易于调整的奖励函数方法，消除了离线阶段，并在静态评估和在线RLHF中实现了新的最先进的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代强化学习人类反馈（RLHF）管道中的奖励模型训练是成本瓶颈，通常需要数十亿参数和离线偏好调整阶段。因此，研究者试图找到一种更高效的方法来替代重型评估模型。

Method: 使用一个冻结的、指令调优的7B LLM，仅添加一行JSON评分标准和rank-16 LoRA适配器（影响模型参数的0.8%），使其可以完全替代以前使用的重型评估模型。此外，引入HH-Rationales子集以检查可解释性，并伴随人类生成的理由。

Result: 提出的插件式法官在RewardBench上达到96.2%的准确率，优于参数范围从27B到70B的专业奖励网络。同时，使7B的行为者在GSM-8K上利用在线PPO实现92%的确切匹配准确率，超过顶级70B DPO基线。消融实验表明，上下文中的六个示范提供了大部分零样本到少量样本的改进（+2pp），而LoRA有效地解决了剩余的差异，特别是在安全性和对抗性Chat-Hard部分。GPT-4评分显示，LoRA法官在与人类解释的相似性上得分为约9/10，而零样本法官得分为约5/10。

Conclusion: 这种组合提示工程和小型LoRA调整的方法产生了一个成本效益高、透明且易于调整的奖励函数，消除了离线阶段，并在静态评估和在线RLHF中取得了新的最先进的结果。

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study proposes a new LSTM framework for forecasting daily state-level incident hospitalizations in the U.S., introducing Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH) as a spatiotemporal feature. The model outperforms existing ones, especially during Omicron surge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide accurate and timely hospitalization forecasts to support healthcare planning, addressing shortcomings of existing models that struggle with variant surges.

Method: A parallel LSTM architecture is used to capture temporal dependencies, along with SPH derived from Facebook's Social Connectedness Index to represent interstate population interaction. Multi-horizon ensembling balances consistency and error.

Result: The model surpasses COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models by 27, 42, 54, and 69 hospitalizations per state on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th forecast days respectively during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation experiments confirm SPH's predictive power.

Conclusion: This research advances hospitalization forecasting, emphasizing the importance of spatiotemporal features like SPH in improving predictive performance for infectious disease spread modeling.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,
timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning.
However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.

*Yang Li,Zhi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces flowOE, an imitation learning framework using flow matching models to improve upon traditional optimal execution strategies in financial markets. It demonstrates superior performance across various market conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimal execution strategies like static Almgren-Chriss models are suboptimal in dynamic financial markets due to their inability to adaptively balance market impact costs and timing/volatility risks.

Method: flowOE is a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching models that learns from a diverse set of expert traditional strategies and uses a refining loss function to adaptively select the most suitable expert behavior for prevailing market conditions.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that flowOE significantly outperforms specifically calibrated expert models and other traditional benchmarks by achieving higher profits with reduced risk.

Conclusion: flowOE presents a practical and effective approach to enhance adaptive optimal execution in financial markets.

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

*Yunpeng Qing,Shuo Chen,Yixiao Chi,Shunyu Liu,Sixu Lin,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel data augmentation framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from intermediate states, achieving superior performance on D4RL benchmark suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static datasets in offline RL often exhibit distribution bias, limiting generalizability. Current data augmentation techniques focus only on reconstructing future trajectories, ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them.

Method: Introduces BiTrajDiff, which decomposes trajectory generation into two diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions. This allows leveraging critical states as anchors to expand into underexplored regions of the state space.

Result: Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

Conclusion: BiTrajDiff addresses the limitation of current DA techniques by modeling both future and history trajectories, enhancing dataset diversity and achieving better performance in offline RL.

Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that
effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on
pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit
distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this
limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which
leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising
results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future
trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history
transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders
the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to
critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we
introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework
for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any
intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task
into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating
forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating
backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can
efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially
valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating
dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite
demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other
advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

TL;DR: 在加密货币限价订单簿（LOB）数据中，通过数据预处理和超参数调整，较简单的模型在短期价格预测任务上可以匹配甚至超越复杂网络的表现，同时提供更快的推理速度和更高的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习架构在处理预处理后的股票和期货LOB数据时展现出良好的预测性能，但这些模型通常将模型复杂性视为无条件的优点。本文旨在探讨增加隐藏层或参数是否真的能增强短期价格预测能力，还是收益主要归因于数据预处理和特征工程。

Method: 使用公开的Bybit数据，从100毫秒到多秒间隔采样的BTC/USDT LOB快照，基准测试一系列模型（从可解释的基线模型如逻辑回归、XGBoost到深度架构如DeepLOB、Conv1D+LSTM）。引入两种数据过滤管道（Kalman、Savitzky Golay），并评估二元（上升/下降）和三元（上升/平稳/下降）标记方案。

Result: 结果表明，通过数据预处理和超参数调整，简单模型可以匹配甚至超过更复杂网络的性能，并且提供更快的推理速度和更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: 复杂模型并不总是优于简单模型，在短期价格预测任务中，经过适当的数据预处理和超参数调整，简单模型能够达到更好的效果，同时具备更快的推理速度和更高的可解释性。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply
demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of
LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has
demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive
performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat
model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine
whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural
networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are
primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We
benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic
regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT
LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly
available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,
Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)
labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,
latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing
and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the
performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater
interpretability.

*Wenyu Zhu,Jianhui Wang,Bowen Gao,Yinjun Jia,Haichuan Tan,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Yanyan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an alignment-and-aggregation framework for virtual screening that performs well on apo structures and significantly improves early enrichment factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual screening methods degrade in performance when applied to apo or predicted structures due to the lack of pocket information. This is problematic for real-world drug discovery scenarios.

Method: The method includes a tri-modal contrastive learning module for aligning ligand, holo pocket, and detected cavities representations, and a cross-attention based adapter for aggregating candidate binding sites dynamically.

Result: Evaluated on a benchmark of apo structures, the method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, improving the early enrichment factor from 11.75 to 37.19. It also maintains strong performance on holo structures.

Conclusion: This approach holds promise for advancing first-in-class drug discovery, especially in cases where experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes are unavailable.

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

Motivation: 理解神经网络中单个单元的功能对于机械可解释性至关重要，而现有评估方法需要更统一、更清晰的框架来提升其可靠性和实用性。

Method: 将多种现存的解释评估方法整合到一个数学框架下，进行比较分析并应用统计方法优化评估流程，同时提出两项合理性检查测试评价指标的可靠性。

Result: 发现许多常用评估指标无法通过合理性测试，即使对概念标签进行大幅修改也未改变评分；基于实验与理论结果，提出未来评估应遵循的指导原则，并确定了一组可靠的评估指标。

Conclusion: 提出了一套新的评估框架，提高了对神经网络单元解释评估的理解和清晰度，并明确了未来研究方向及可靠度量标准。

Abstract: Understanding the function of individual units in a neural network is an
important building block for mechanistic interpretability. This is often done
by generating a simple text explanation of the behavior of individual neurons
or units. For these explanations to be useful, we must understand how reliable
and truthful they are. In this work we unify many existing explanation
evaluation methods under one mathematical framework. This allows us to compare
existing evaluation metrics, understand the evaluation pipeline with increased
clarity and apply existing statistical methods on the evaluation. In addition,
we propose two simple sanity checks on the evaluation metrics and show that
many commonly used metrics fail these tests and do not change their score after
massive changes to the concept labels. Based on our experimental and
theoretical results, we propose guidelines that future evaluations should
follow and identify a set of reliable evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: SPDO method reduces communication and computation complexities in decentralized optimization by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing communication complexity is crucial for efficient decentralized optimization, but existing PDO methods have significant computational overhead due to the need for highly accurate solutions to subproblems.

Method: The SPDO method achieves state-of-the-art complexities within the PDO framework by refining the analysis of existing PDO methods through relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional similarity.

Result: Experimental results show that SPDO significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of communication and computational complexities.

Conclusion: SPDO is an effective approach to reduce both communication and computational complexities in decentralized optimization.

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized
optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is
particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional
similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local
functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster
convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often
require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal
operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we
propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which
achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within
the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods
by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional
similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly
outperforms existing methods.

*Qianyi Chen,Tianrun Gao,Chenbo Jiang,Tailin Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EqCollide is a new simulator that accurately models deformable object collisions using equivariant neural fields, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is crucial but complex due to the difficulty in modeling solid mechanics and multi-body interactions. Current data-driven methods have limitations such as lack of equivariance to physical symmetries, poor handling of collisions, and limited scalability.

Method: The EqCollide simulator uses an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and velocity into latent control points. It then employs a Graph Neural Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation for collision-aware message passing among control points. Finally, it queries a neural field conditioned on control point features to reconstruct velocity fields, allowing continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions.

Result: Experimental results indicate that EqCollide provides accurate, stable, and scalable simulations across various object configurations. It achieves 24.34% to 35.82% lower rollout MSE compared to the best-performing baseline model. The model also generalizes well to more colliding objects and extended time periods, maintaining robustness under input transformations.

Conclusion: EqCollide represents a significant advancement in simulating deformable object collisions, offering superior accuracy, stability, scalability, and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging
task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body
interactions. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of
equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and
limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end
equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their
collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and
velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural
Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions
among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct
velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features,
enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental
results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations
across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82%
lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model.
Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended
temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning methods present significant potential for improving option pricing in computational finance through enhanced accuracy and robustness, supported by a theoretical-financial framework.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is characterized by flexibility, high precision, and
refined structure. As a critical component within computational finance, option
pricing with machine learning requires both high predictive accuracy and
reduced structural complexity-features that align well with the inherent
advantages of ensemble learning. This paper investigates the application of
ensemble learning to option pricing, and conducts a comparative analysis with
classical machine learning models to assess their performance in terms of
accuracy, local feature extraction, and robustness to noise. A novel
experimental strategy is introduced, leveraging parameter transfer across

upon this strategy, an evaluation mechanism is developed that incorporates a
scoring strategy and a weighted evaluation strategy explicitly emphasizing the
foundational role of financial theory. This mechanism embodies an orderly
integration of theoretical finance and computational methods. In addition, the
study examines the interaction between sliding window technique and noise,
revealing nuanced patterns that suggest a potential connection relevant to

*Chuang Ma,Tomoyuki Obuchi,Toshiyuki Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In this study, researchers investigate whether Neural Collapse (NC) occurs in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks. They discover a similar phenomenon called Ordinal Neural Collapse (ONC), which has three properties: optimal features collapse to within-class mean with regularization (ONC1); class means align with the classifier (ONC2); and latent variables align according to class order (ONC3). These insights are proven analytically and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to explore if a phenomenon similar to Neural Collapse (NC) can be observed in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, expanding the understanding of NC beyond classification tasks.

Method: The method involves combining the cumulative link model for OR and the Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM). The researchers analyze the properties of the phenomenon they call Ordinal Neural Collapse (ONC), proving them analytically within the UFM framework with fixed threshold values and verifying them empirically across various datasets.

Result: The results show that ONC emerges with three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class means align with the classifier; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables are aligned according to the class order, with a simple geometric relationship emerging in the zero-regularization limit.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that Ordinal Neural Collapse (ONC) is a phenomenon that indeed occurs in deep Ordinal Regression tasks, characterized by three specific properties. These findings provide new insights into OR tasks and highlight the potential use of fixed thresholds.

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks,
in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an
extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable
attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how
deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been
proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work
that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for
practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar
phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the
cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal
Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following
three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to
their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class
means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a
one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to
logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the
class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly
local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables
and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM
framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a
variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,
highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 消息传递图神经网络（GNNs）由于其局部归纳偏置，限制了利用关键结构信息的能力。位置编码（PE）和持续同调（PH）是缓解此问题的两种有前途的方法。然而，关于PE和PH相对优缺点的严格理论描述一直难以捉摸。本文通过建立两者在表达能力上互不占优的关系，并提出一种新的可学习方法PiPE（Persistence-informed Positional Encoding），该方法在多种任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了弥补GNNs在利用关键结构信息（如连通性和循环）上的不足，研究者们提出了位置编码（PE）和持续同调（PH）两种方法。但它们各自的优劣尚缺乏严格的理论分析。

Method: 作者首先证明了PE和PH在表达能力上没有高低之分，并给出了一个方法成功而另一个失败的新构造。基于这些见解，设计了一种新的可学习方法PiPE，结合了PE和PH的优点并超越了两者的表达能力。

Result: PiPE在多种任务上展示了强大的性能，包括分子性质预测、图分类和分布外泛化等任务，显著推进了图表示学习的前沿。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析和实验证明了PiPE的有效性，为图神经网络的设计提供了新思路，并推动了图表示学习领域的发展。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method for backward compatible representation learning in hyperbolic space to improve model updates and maintain compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in Euclidean space for backward compatible representation learning do not account for uncertainty in old models, forcing new models to reconstruct outdated representations regardless of quality, which hinders the learning process.

Method: The authors propose to use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning, treating time as an axis for capturing model confidence and evolution. They lift embeddings into hyperbolic space and constrain updated embeddings within the entailment cone of old ones to maintain consistency and account for uncertainties. A robust contrastive alignment loss is introduced to dynamically adjust alignment weights based on the uncertainty of old embeddings.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method achieves superior compatibility compared to existing approaches, enabling more resilient and adaptable machine learning systems.

Conclusion: Switching to hyperbolic geometry with consideration of uncertainties improves backward compatibility in representation learning, opening possibilities for better model updates and system adaptability.

Abstract: Backward compatible representation learning enables updated models to
integrate seamlessly with existing ones, avoiding to reprocess stored data.
Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space
neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to
reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby
hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to
switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural
axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings
into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the
entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across
models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further
enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that
dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old
embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in
achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable
machine learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WDAN is a model-agnostic framework that uses discrete wavelet transforms to break down time series data into low-frequency trends and high-frequency fluctuations, then applies tailored normalization strategies to each part to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting non-stationary time series is challenging due to changes in statistical properties over time. Existing instance-level normalization techniques do not fully account for the multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit distinct non-stationary behaviors.

Method: Propose WDAN which uses discrete wavelet transforms to decompose the input into low-frequency trends and high-frequency fluctuations, and applies tailored normalization strategies to each part. For trend components with strong non-stationarity, first-order differencing is used to extract stable features for predicting normalization parameters.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various backbone models.

Conclusion: WDAN addresses non-stationarity in time series forecasting by considering the multi-component nature of time series and applying specific normalization strategies.

Abstract: Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their
statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models
to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address
shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the
multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit
distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based
Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed
to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete
wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and
high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies
to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we
apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting
normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various
backbone model. Code is available at this repository:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has emerged as an important research topic in the field
of machine learning. Although numerous methods have been proposed to improve
clustering quality, most existing approaches overlook the need for
interpretability in high-stakes applications. In domains such as medical
diagnosis and financial risk assessment, algorithms must not only be accurate
but also interpretable to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making.
Therefore, to fill the gap of lack of interpretable algorithms in the field of
clustering ensemble, we propose the first interpretable clustering ensemble
algorithm in the literature. By treating base partitions as categorical
variables, our method constructs a decision tree in the original feature space
and use the statistical association test to guide the tree building process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering ensemble methods while
maintaining an additional feature of interpretability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for
clustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in
interpretable clustering.

Motivation: To explore an alternative to gradient-based loss minimization in neural network training that can better exploit parallelism and handle non-differentiable operations.

Method: Reformulate neural network training as a large-scale feasibility problem by finding parameters and states that satisfy local constraints derived from elementary operations. Use projection operators and iterative projection algorithms for training.

Result: Successfully trained diverse neural network architectures using the PJAX framework, showing comparable performance to traditional methods with advantages in parallelism and handling non-differentiable operations.

Conclusion: The feasibility-seeking approach offers a promising alternative to gradient-based training, enabled by the PJAX framework, which supports efficient and scalable training of neural networks.

Abstract: We present a feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training. This
mathematical optimization framework is distinct from conventional
gradient-based loss minimization and uses projection operators and iterative
projection algorithms. We reformulate training as a large-scale feasibility
problem: finding network parameters and states that satisfy local constraints
derived from its elementary operations. Training then involves projecting onto
these constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the
network. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this
paradigm. PJAX composes projection operators for elementary operations,
automatically deriving the solution operators for the feasibility problems
(akin to autodiff for derivatives). It inherently supports GPU/TPU
acceleration, provides a familiar NumPy-like API, and is extensible. We train
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks using PJAX,
demonstrating its functionality and generality. Our results show that this
approach is as a compelling alternative to gradient-based training, with clear
advantages in parallelism and the ability to handle non-differentiable
operations.

*Adrien Petralia,Philippe Charpentier,Youssef Kadhi,Themis Palpanas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NILMFormer is a Transformer-based architecture designed for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches by incorporating a new subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme and a novel positional encoding based on timestamp information. It has been deployed by EDF to provide detailed power consumption insights to millions of customers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historically, energy consumption estimates have relied on statistical methods using coarse-grained data and static customer information. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world smart meter data affects model performance in disaggregating total household power consumption into individual appliances' consumption.

Method: NILMFormer uses a Transformer-based architecture with a new subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to handle distribution drift and a novel positional encoding that relies solely on timestamp information.

Result: Experiments with 4 real-world datasets demonstrate that NILMFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring.

Conclusion: NILMFormer provides an effective solution for disaggregating household power consumption data, improving energy monitoring services and delivering detailed insights about individual appliances' power consumption to millions of customers through its deployment by EDF.

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Motivation: 提高智能电网系统管理对抗气候变化至关重要，而让消费者参与其中是一个重大挑战。尽管智能电表记录了家庭用电数据，但由于信号聚合了多个同时运行的设备的用电情况，难以理解。非侵入式负载监控（NILM）旨在利用主智能电表信号估计单个设备的用电情况，但现有方法需要昂贵且稀缺的标注数据。

Conclusion: CamAL提供了一种有效的弱监督解决方案，能够显著减少对昂贵标注数据的需求，从而为大规模应用NILM技术提供了可能。

Abstract: Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against
climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is
a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of
smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the
main electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces
valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;
nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different
appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to
apprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of
estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of
individual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods
proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning
approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of
individual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and
extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in
households to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a
weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only
requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be
trained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an
explainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.
Our experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates
that CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and
that current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more
labels to reach CamAL performances. The source of our experiments is available

*Shirui Zhou,Jiying Yan,Junfang Tian,Tao Wang,Yongfu Li,Shiquan Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new data-driven car-following framework is proposed to address the limitation of existing models in capturing intra-driver heterogeneity. It combines GRUs and LSTM networks to embed discrete driving regimes into vehicular motion predictions, reducing prediction errors for acceleration, speed, and spacing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to accurately represent the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, especially the intra-driver heterogeneity which current models fail to capture effectively due to their focus on inter-driver heterogeneity or reliance on simplified assumptions.

Method: The method involves proposing a hybrid deep learning architecture that uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for discrete driving regime classification and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for continuous kinematic prediction. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping.

Result: The framework significantly reduces prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47%), speed, and spacing metrics. It also reproduces critical traffic phenomena such as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Conclusion: This novel framework successfully captures both inter- and intra-driver heterogeneity by unifying discrete decision-making processes and continuous vehicular dynamics, providing more accurate car-following predictions.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately
representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the
intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate
dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional
and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often
emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions,
limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver
under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel
data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving
regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular
motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the
proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for
discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for
continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes
and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and
intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up
segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust
characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios.
Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces
prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%),
speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such
as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Motivation: Electricity suppliers face challenges in helping non-expert users understand the aggregated smart meter data and derive usage patterns for different appliances. Ground-truth labels for training models are expensive and scarce.

Method: The paper introduces DeviceScope, which uses CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach that only needs the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a household to be trained.

Result: DeviceScope can detect and localize individual appliance patterns within a given time period from the smart meter data effectively.

Conclusion: DeviceScope is a promising solution for facilitating understanding smart meter data by detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns.

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart

valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the

TL;DR: The paper proposes Over-PINNs, an enhancement of PINNs using automatic differentiation to generate higher-order auxiliary equations for additional physical constraints. This improves accuracy in solving PDEs without significant extra computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of PINNs when dealing with complex problems by introducing additional physical constraints.

Method: Introduction of the Over-PINNs framework which uses automatic differentiation to create higher-order auxiliary equations incorporated as extra loss terms during training.

Result: Numerical results show strong versatility and significant improvement in solution accuracy for various types of PDEs without substantial additional computational costs.

Conclusion: Over-PINNs effectively enhances the ability of neural networks to capture physical information through an overdetermined approach.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone of
mathematical physics. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have significantly reduced the dependence on large datasets by embedding
physical laws directly into the training of neural networks. However, when
dealing with complex problems, the accuracy of PINNs still has room for
improvement. To address this issue, we introduce the Over-PINNs framework,
which leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to generate higher-order
auxiliary equations that impose additional physical constraints. These
equations are incorporated as extra loss terms in the training process,
effectively enhancing the model's ability to capture physical information
through an "overdetermined" approach. Numerical results illustrate that this
method exhibits strong versatility in solving various types of PDEs. It
achieves a significant improvement in solution accuracy without incurring
substantial additional computational costs.

TL;DR: The paper explores machine learning models to predict traffic congestion due to road maintenance, finding XGBoost most effective in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic conditions is crucial as maintenance operations can worsen congestion if not carefully planned.

Method: Using machine learning-based surrogate models to predict network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. Framing the problem as a supervised learning task with one-hot encodings, engineered traffic features, and heuristic approximations. Evaluating different regression models under an online learning framework.

Result: XGBoost achieves substantially better accuracy than other models with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 11%, outperforming the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively in MAPE and Pinball loss.

Conclusion: XGBoost significantly outperforms alternatives in predicting congestion, offering potential to reduce computational burden in large-scale traffic assignment problems for maintenance planning.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic
conditions is important because maintenance operations can substantially worsen
congestion if not carefully planned. Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid
excessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in
congestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are
commonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,
when applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping
projects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands
of times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper
investigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict
network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the
problem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered
traffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,
ensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under
an online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The
experimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a
reasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most
regression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which
achieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost
significantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a
MAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.
This modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of
large-scale traffic assignment problems in maintenance planning.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在高风险应用中的可靠性至关重要，因为面对分布外或对抗性输入可能导致有害结果。现有的EDL方法容易受到对抗性扰动的影响，导致过度自信的错误预测。

Method: C-EDL是一种轻量级的后处理不确定性量化方法，无需重新训练即可增强对抗性和OOD鲁棒性。它为每个输入生成多样化的任务保持转换，并通过量化表示分歧在校准不确定性估计时进行调整。

Result: C-EDL显著优于现有的EDL变体和竞争基线，在多种数据集、攻击类型和不确定性度量上，对于OOD数据覆盖率降低了高达55%，对抗性数据覆盖率降低了高达90%。

Conclusion: C-EDL能够有效提高模型对对抗性输入和OOD输入的检测能力，同时保持较高的分布内准确率和较低的计算开销。

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack
types, and uncertainty metrics.

*Andrés Guzmán-Cordero,Floor Eijkelboom,Jan-Willem van de Meent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabbyFlow is a new method for generating tabular data that combines variational Flow Matching with Exponential Family distributions to efficiently handle mixed continuous and discrete variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative modeling techniques, such as denoising diffusion and flow matching, have not been effectively applied to tabular data, which is common in real-world applications.

Method: The paper introduces TabbyFlow, which uses Variational Flow Matching (VFM) specifically designed for tabular data generation. They also propose Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM) to represent heterogeneous data types using exponential family distributions, allowing for moment matching-based learning of probability paths over mixed variable types. Additionally, the authors establish connections between VFM and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.

Result: TabbyFlow demonstrates state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on tabular data benchmarks compared to existing baselines.

Conclusion: TabbyFlow offers an efficient solution for generating tabular data with mixed continuous and discrete features through its use of EF-VFM and moment matching, advancing the state of the art in this domain.

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in
generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite
its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a
variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply
VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce
Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents
heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We
hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,
enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and
discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow
matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.
Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
compared to baselines.

### [108] [Comparative Analysis of Modern Machine Learning Models for Retail Sales Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05941)
*Luka Hobor,Mario Brcic,Lidija Polutnik,Ante Kapetanovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Accurate forecasting is crucial for business planning. This study evaluates various forecasting models on a high-resolution brick-and-mortar retail dataset, concluding that tree-based models provide superior accuracy and efficiency, while neural models struggle with irregularities in physical retail data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sales forecasting is essential to avoid costs from unsold inventories or lost sales due to underestimation, providing a competitive advantage for businesses.

Method: The study compares tree-based ensembles (XGBoost, LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures (N-BEATS, NHITS, Temporal Fusion Transformer) using a high-resolution brick-and-mortar retail dataset, addressing issues like intermittent demand, missing values, and frequent product turnover.

Result: Tree-based models applied locally on individual groups with non-imputed data consistently offer superior forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency compared to neural networks which, despite benefiting from advanced imputation methods, still underperform on handling the irregularities typical of physical retail data.

Conclusion: Tree-based models are more suitable for accurate and efficient forecasting in physical retail environments, emphasizing the importance of proper data preprocessing.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting is key for all business planning. When estimated sales
are too high, brick-and-mortar retailers may incur higher costs due to unsold
inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管传统的一维信号分解技术依赖于数学模型，但最新的深度学习模型在这个领域具有未开发且有潜力的应用前景。

Method: 利用Transformer架构构建了一个新模型，该模型可以将一维信号分解为分段常数、平滑（低频振荡）、纹理（高频振荡）和噪声成分。

Abstract: One-dimensional signal decomposition is a well-established and widely used
technique across various scientific fields. It serves as a highly valuable
pre-processing step for data analysis. While traditional decomposition
techniques often rely on mathematical models, recent research suggests that
applying the latest deep learning models to this problem presents an exciting,
unexplored area with promising potential. This work presents a novel method for
the additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals. We leverage the
Transformer architecture to decompose signals into their constituent
components: piece-wise constant, smooth (low-frequency oscillatory), textured
(high-frequency oscillatory), and a noise component. Our model, trained on
synthetic data, achieves excellent accuracy in modeling and decomposing input
signals from the same distribution, as demonstrated by the experimental
results.

### [110] [Learning Deterministic Policies with Policy Gradients in Constrained Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05953)
*Alessandro Montenegro,Leonardo Cesani,Marco Mussi,Matteo Papini,Alberto Maria Metelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces C-PG, an exploration-agnostic algorithm for Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) that ensures global last-iterate convergence under certain conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in learning deterministic policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges of Constrained Reinforcement Learning where agents must maximize expected return while adhering to specific constraints. Current policy-based methods are effective but have limitations in terms of exploration strategies and convergence guarantees.

Method: The method involves introducing C-PG, an algorithm compatible with both action-based and parameter-based exploration strategies. It operates under gradient domination assumptions and provides global last-iterate convergence guarantees. Under specific noise models, it can learn a stochastic (hyper)policy and transition to a deterministic policy post-training.

Result: C-PG demonstrates global last-iterate convergence to the optimal deterministic policy under specified conditions. Empirical validation shows that both variants (action-based C-PGAE and parameter-based C-PGPE) outperform state-of-the-art baselines, particularly when deploying deterministic policies after training.

Conclusion: C-PG is a robust algorithm for Constrained Reinforcement Learning, providing theoretical convergence guarantees and practical effectiveness in learning and deploying deterministic policies.

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making
problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected
return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based
methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with
continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an
action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether
they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic
hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which
enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination
assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy
is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters
of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global
last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic
policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently
switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a
deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based
(C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control
tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their
effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after
training.

### [111] [Pruning Spurious Subgraphs for Graph Out-of-Distribtuion Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05957)
*Tianjun Yao,Haoxuan Li,Yongqiang Chen,Tongliang Liu,Le Song,Eric Xing,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face challenges with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This paper introduces PrunE, a pruning-based graph OOD method that removes spurious edges to enhance OOD generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs often suffer from performance degradation when dealing with distribution shifts between training and test data. Existing methods attempt to identify an invariant subgraph predictive of target labels, but this is challenging due to the presence of spurious edges that exhibit strong correlations with targets.

Method: PrunE employs two regularization terms for pruning spurious edges: 1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2) $\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress spurious edges. By doing so, it retains the invariant subgraph more comprehensively.

Result: Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, PrunE demonstrates superior OOD performance and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PrunE is the first pruning-based graph OOD method that effectively eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD generalizability, making GNNs more applicable in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance
degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed
various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,
with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an
invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue
that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging
and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong
correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first
pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD
generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant
subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.
Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:
1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)
$\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious
edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that
PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at:

*Adil Hasan,Thomas Peyrin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过应用基于码本的加性向量量化方法，实现了扩散模型在极低比特权重量化上的新帕累托前沿，并在LDM-4基准测试中取得显著优于全精度模型的结果，同时展示了跨硬件的高效推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型的广泛应用受限于其对硬件资源的高需求，尽管均匀标量量化（USQ）等策略有所帮助，但仍未充分利用向量量化（VQ）方法的潜力，特别是在大语言模型中的成功经验表明其可能带来的优势。

Method: 研究采用了基于码本的加性向量量化方法进行扩散模型压缩，在标准LDM-4基准上评估了极低比特权重量化的效果，并通过高效的推理内核展示了任意硬件上的浮点运算节省。

Result: 在20步推理时间下，W4A8配置下的sFID比全精度模型低1.92点，并且在W2A8配置下报告了最佳的FID、sFID和ISC结果。此外，通过高效推理内核证明了跨硬件的浮点运算节省。

Conclusion: 基于码本的加性向量量化为扩散模型提供了一种有效的压缩方法，在降低硬件需求的同时保持或提升了生成质量，并具备广泛的硬件兼容性。

Abstract: Significant investments have been made towards the commodification of
diffusion models for generation of diverse media. Their mass-market adoption is
however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of
diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically
towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have
generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization
methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups
of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen
substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work,
we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of
diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto
frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard
class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps.
Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8
and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able
to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference
kernel, as opposed to savings resulting from small integer operations which may
lack broad hardware support.

*Motoki Omura,Kazuki Ota,Takayuki Osa,Yusuke Mukuta,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into actor-critic methods for continuous action spaces accelerates learning but introduces overestimation bias. An annealing approach is proposed to transition from the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, mitigating bias while maintaining performance improvements. This method, when combined with TD3 and SAC, outperforms existing approaches in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Actor-critic methods for continuous action spaces typically model Q-values using the Bellman operator and rely on policy updates for improvement, which can result in low sample efficiency. The study aims to explore the effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator to improve learning efficiency.

Method: The study incorporates the Bellman optimality operator into actor-critic frameworks for continuous action spaces. It proposes an annealing approach that gradually transitions from the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator to address overestimation bias introduced by modeling optimal values.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that modeling optimal values using the Bellman optimality operator accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. The proposed annealing approach effectively mitigates this bias while maintaining performance improvements. The method significantly outperforms existing approaches when combined with TD3 and SAC across various locomotion and manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating the Bellman optimality operator with an annealing approach can accelerate learning and improve performance in actor-critic methods for continuous action spaces, while effectively addressing overestimation bias.

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online
reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete
actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

*Jacob Bamberger,Benjamin Gutteridge,Scott le Roux,Michael M. Bronstein,Xiaowen Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the lack of a robust and theoretical approach to long-range graph tasks by formalizing long-range interactions, introducing a range measure for graph operators, and validating it through synthetic experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-range graph tasks are an open problem in graph neural network research with current validation methods lacking robustness and theoretical underpinning.

Method: Formalize long-range interactions in graph tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate this measure using synthetic experiments.

Result: The measure is used to examine common tasks and architectures, determining the extent to which they are truly long-range.

Conclusion: This work advances the definition and addressing of long-range problems on graphs and provides a tool for evaluating new datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

TL;DR: FedBE是一种新的联邦微调框架，结合了自适应Transformer块扩展机制和动态可训练块分配策略，能有效应对灾难性遗忘问题并提高模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦微调方法虽然使用参数高效微调技术减少了通信和计算开销，但未能充分解决分布式环境中持续适应带来的灾难性遗忘问题，同时数据分布和设备能力的变化也加剧了这一问题。

Method: 提出FedBE框架，通过扩展可训练块将新学习的任务特定知识与原始预训练表示结构分离，并根据客户端的数据分布和计算能力动态分配这些可训练块。

Result: 实验表明，与现有方法相比，FedBE在微调后的一般任务上保留了12-74%更高的准确性，并且在不影响下游任务准确性的情况下实现了1.9-3.1倍的模型收敛加速比。

Conclusion: FedBE能够更好地适应异构联邦环境，显著缓解灾难性遗忘问题，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

*Geonwoo Cho,Jaemoon Lee,Jaegyun Im,Subi Lee,Jihwan Lee,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMPED is a new method for skill-based reinforcement learning that balances exploration and skill diversity through gradient surgery and dynamic skill selection, surpassing SBRL baselines in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective skill learning requires maximizing both exploration and skill diversity, but existing methods struggle to optimize these conflicting objectives simultaneously.

Method: The approach includes extensive ablation studies to define objectives for exploration and skill diversity. During pretraining, AMPED uses gradient surgery to balance these objectives. In the fine-tuning phase, a skill selector module dynamically picks skills based on task-specific signals.

Result: AMPED outperforms SBRL baselines across various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in harmonizing exploration and diversity for robust skill learning.

Conclusion: Explicitly balancing exploration and skill diversity is crucial for effective skill learning, and AMPED successfully achieves this, leading to superior performance.

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and
generalizable skill learning. Project Page: https://geonwoo.me/amped/

Conclusion: DMPEL提供了一种更高效的方法来进行终身学习，减少了灾难性遗忘并促进了灵活的行为适应。

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime,
achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively
steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However,
in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical
assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among
isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of
Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot
learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a
lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy,
facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by
leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce
coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts
for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than
applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on
the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across
continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

*Yi-Chun Liao,Chieh-Lin Tsai,Yuan-Hao Chang,Camélia Slimani,Jalil Boukhobza,Tei-Wei Kuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents RETENTION, an end-to-end framework that reduces content-addressable memory (CAM) capacity requirements for tree-based model inference by using an iterative pruning algorithm and a tree mapping scheme. It achieves significant improvements in space efficiency with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree-based models outperform deep learning in structured data but face challenges in acceleration due to high memory consumption and low utilization when using conventional accelerators. Existing CAM-based solutions have excessive memory usage and inefficiency.

Method: The authors introduce RETENTION, which includes an iterative pruning algorithm to reduce model complexity while controlling accuracy degradation, specifically designed for bagging-based models like Random Forest. They also propose a tree mapping scheme with two data placement strategies to reduce memory redundancy from don't care states in CAM.

Result: The tree mapping scheme alone improves space efficiency by 1.46x to 21.30x, while the full RETENTION framework provides 4.35x to 207.12x improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.

Conclusion: RETENTION effectively reduces CAM capacity requirements for tree-based model inference, offering a resource-efficient solution for accelerating these models.

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

*Sanna Jarl,Jens Sjölund,Robert J. W. Frost,Anders Holst,Jonathan J. S. Scragg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-driving lab (SDL) using magnetron co-sputtering and machine learning (ML) to create accurate composition maps for multi-element, combinatorial thin films. It presents a method that predicts composition distribution with in-situ measurements via quartz-crystal microbalance sensors, applying active learning through Gaussian processes (GPs). The best-performing ML procedure was found to be a fully Bayesian GP - BALM, which efficiently learned deposition rates within 10 experiments. This framework significantly increases throughput by eliminating the need for extensive characterization or calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in thin film science where SDLs are mainly restricted to solution-based synthetic methods, incapable of accessing the broad chemical space of inorganic materials, the authors developed an SDL based on magnetron co-sputtering to produce accurate composition maps more rapidly and without calibration.

Method: The method involves using combinatorial frameworks and in-situ measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter chamber. Active learning with Gaussian processes is applied to learn sensor readings as functions of sputtering pressure and magnetron power. A geometric model of the deposition flux distribution in the chamber complements this process, enabling interpolation of deposition rates at any position across the sample. Several acquisition functions for the ML procedure were investigated, identifying BALM as the most effective.

Result: The fully Bayesian GP - BALM achieved the best performance, learning deposition rates for a single source in just 10 experiments. Experimental verification confirmed prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions. The framework successfully avoided time-consuming ex-situ analysis, reducing systematic errors and dramatically increasing throughput.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning-guided SDLs to accelerate materials exploration by providing a rapid, calibration-free in-situ approach to produce accurate composition maps for multi-element combinatorial thin films.

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to
accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of
new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to
solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access
the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL
based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,
obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded
thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to
systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven
approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and
sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition
distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ
measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter
chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of
the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using
Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of
the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of
the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We
investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully
Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best
performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10
experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions
was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by
avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus
demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials

*Shilong Tao,Zhe Feng,Haonan Sun,Zhanxing Zhu,Yunhuai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaDEEP is a deep learning-based surrogate model for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids, which achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element methods with a comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical numerical solvers are constrained by an inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency when dealing with large deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Deep learning models have made progress in solving the continuum mechanism, but they are designed for general instances without considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading.

Method: The method involves encoding the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a token sequence to maintain their essential order property. A two-stage Transformer-based module is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.

Result: Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47% relative improvement on average compared to other deep learning baselines.

Conclusion: LaDEEP has been deployed into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Scientific computing for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids is
critical for numerous real-world applications. Classical numerical solvers rely
primarily on local discrete linear approximation and are constrained by an
inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, deep learning
models have achieved impressive progress in solving the continuum mechanism.
While previous models have explored various architectures and constructed
coefficient-solution mappings, they are designed for general instances without
considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle with
complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading. In
this work, we take stretch bending, a popular metal fabrication technique, as
our case study and introduce LaDEEP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for
\textbf{La}rge \textbf{De}formation of \textbf{E}lastic-\textbf{P}lastic
Solids. We encode the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a
token sequence to maintain their essential order property. To characterize the
physical process of the solid deformation, a two-stage Transformer-based module
is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.
Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element
methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47\% relative improvement on
average compared to other deep learning baselines. We have also deployed our
model into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown
remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes LightGTS, a lightweight time series forecasting model that uses Periodical Tokenization and Periodical Parallel Decoding to efficiently forecast with less computational burden.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing general time series forecasting models have superior generalization but suffer from significant computational burdens and limitations in resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: LightGTS incorporates two techniques: Periodical Tokenization for extracting consistent periodic patterns across datasets and Periodical Parallel Decoding for utilizing periodicity in the decoding process by leveraging historical tokens.

Result: LightGTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in both zero-shot and full-shot settings with better efficiency compared to existing models.

Conclusion: LightGTS is a lightweight model that effectively leverages periodic patterns in time series data to achieve outstanding performance with much better efficiency.

Abstract: Existing works on general time series forecasting build foundation models
with heavy model parameters through large-scale multi-source pre-training.
These models achieve superior generalization ability across various datasets at
the cost of significant computational burdens and limitations in
resource-constrained scenarios. This paper introduces LightGTS, a lightweight
general time series forecasting model designed from the perspective of
consistent periodical modeling. To handle diverse scales and intrinsic periods
in multi-source pre-training, we introduce Periodical Tokenization, which
extracts consistent periodic patterns across different datasets with varying
scales. To better utilize the periodicity in the decoding process, we further
introduce Periodical Parallel Decoding, which leverages historical tokens to
improve forecasting. Based on the two techniques above which fully leverage the
inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight
model to achieve outstanding performance on general time series forecasting. It
achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in
both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with
existing time series foundation models.

TL;DR: Unisoma is a new explicit modeling paradigm using Transformer-based model to capture physical interactions in multi-solid systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for modeling multi-solid systems predominantly rely on implicit modeling, which struggles with accurately capturing intricate physical interactions as the number of solids increases.

Method: Introduced Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based model that incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules, contact modules, adaptive interaction allocation mechanism, and triplet relationship learning.

Result: Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling is more suitable for multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, enabling detailed treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.

Abstract: Multi-solid systems are foundational to a wide range of real-world
applications, yet modeling their complex interactions remains challenging.
Existing deep learning methods predominantly rely on implicit modeling, where
the factors influencing solid deformation are not explicitly represented but
are instead indirectly learned. However, as the number of solids increases,
these methods struggle to accurately capture intricate physical interactions.
In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit modeling paradigm that
incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules.
Specifically, we present Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based
model capable of handling variable numbers of solids. Unisoma directly captures
physical interactions using contact modules and adaptive interaction allocation
mechanism, and learns the deformation through a triplet relationship. Compared
to implicit modeling techniques, explicit modeling is more well-suited for
multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, as it enables detailed
treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.
Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across
seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks. Code is

*Jake Robertson,Arik Reuter,Siyuan Guo,Noah Hollmann,Frank Hutter,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) pre-trained on synthetic data for causal effect estimation without needing the underlying causal graph, showing accuracy and robustness through experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for estimating causal effects either require interventional data, knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions like unconfoundedness, which limit their real-world applicability.

Method: Pre-train PFNs on synthetic data from diverse causal structures including interventions to predict interventional outcomes given observational data.

Result: Through extensive experiments, the approach accurately estimates causal effects without knowing the underlying causal graph and demonstrates scalability and robustness across datasets with various causal characteristics.

Conclusion: PFN-based method can effectively estimate causal effects in tabular data settings without requiring the causal graph, offering a promising approach for real-world applications.

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific
disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data,
knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as
unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In
the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on
synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To
assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect
estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of
causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes
given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case
studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal
effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform
ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across
datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

*Tobias Würth,Niklas Freymuth,Gerhard Neumann,Luise Kärger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ROBIN, a novel learned simulator that integrates Rolling Diffusion and a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network to address limitations in graph-based simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based learned simulators struggle with capturing global phenomena and suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on local message passing and direct next-step prediction.

Method: ROBIN integrates two key innovations: (i) Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across different mesh resolutions.

Result: ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

Conclusion: ROBIN is validated on challenging 2D and 3D solid mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.

Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for
simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and
generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with
capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and
suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on
local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these
limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network
(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)
Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of
diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising
steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built
on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across
different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via
Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local
dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending
or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid
mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.
ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially
outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference

*Haripriya Harikumar,Santu Rana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new test-time optimization method is proposed to generate more reliable confidence estimates by considering the impact of noise in classifier weights, showing superior performance in risk-based metrics and effectively identifying distribution discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques struggle to distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones due to noisy classifier weights.

Method: Propose a novel test-time optimization method that considers the impact of noise in classifier weights to produce more reliable confidence estimates.

Result: The score defines a monotonic subset-selection function with consistently increasing population accuracy as samples with lower scores are removed. Superior performance in AUSE and AURC metrics. Effectively identifies training-test distribution discrepancies and differentiates in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples.

Conclusion: The proposed method not only enhances confidence estimates but also elucidates key differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

### [126] [System-Aware Unlearning Algorithms: Use Lesser, Forget Faster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06073)
*Linda Lu,Ayush Sekhari,Karthik Sridharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces system-aware unlearning, a new definition for machine unlearning that considers realistic attackers and presents an efficient algorithm for linear classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current definitions of machine unlearning are too stringent, making it difficult to develop efficient algorithms. This work aims to address this issue by proposing a more practical definition.

Method: Proposes system-aware unlearning which guarantees protection against attackers with limited access. Develops an exact unlearning algorithm for linear classification using selective sampling, and generalizes the method for broader function classes.

Result: Provides theoretical analysis showing trade-offs between deletion capacity, accuracy, memory usage, and computation time.

Conclusion: System-aware unlearning offers a more realistic and efficient approach for machine unlearning compared to previous definitions.

Abstract: Machine unlearning addresses the problem of updating a machine learning
model/system trained on a dataset $S$ so that the influence of a set of
deletion requests $U \subseteq S$ on the unlearned model is minimized. The gold
standard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after
deletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This
definition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only
the unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \setminus
U$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning
algorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In
this work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to
provide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain
access to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and
not all of $S\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple
intuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning
updates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a
system-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware
unlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based
approach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function
classes. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs between deletion capacity,
accuracy, memory, and computation time.

TL;DR: 研究人员提出了一种名为STOF的框架，通过灵活的掩码和操作符融合在GPU上优化稀疏Transformer。该框架统一了多头注意力的存储格式和内核实现，并通过两阶段搜索引擎确定最佳参数设置。实验结果表明，与现有最先进技术相比，STOF在MHA计算和端到端推理中分别实现了最高1.7倍和1.5倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）因其强大的理解能力而受到广泛关注，但加速Transformer（尤其是引入稀疏性的Mask层）的研究仍存在不足。以往的工作很少关注稀疏Transformer的性能优化，同时基于规则的方法无法充分利用混合类型操作符的融合机会，也无法适应不同序列长度的需求。

Method: 研究团队提出了STOF框架，主要包含以下步骤：1) 统一多头注意力的存储格式和内核实现；2) 将融合方案映射到编译模板；3) 通过两阶段搜索引擎确定最优参数配置。这些方法旨在解决现有技术在稀疏Transformer优化中的不足。

Result: 实验结果表明，STOF框架相较于当前最先进的技术，在多头注意力（MHA）计算中实现了最高1.7倍的加速，在端到端推理中实现了最高1.5倍的加速。

Conclusion: STOF框架通过灵活的掩码和操作符融合策略显著提高了稀疏Transformer的性能，为未来的相关研究提供了新的方向和参考。

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful
understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating
Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.
Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.
However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse
Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of
mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address
the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates
optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion
on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the
multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and
determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The
experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF
achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional fine-tuning techniques which are expensive, lengthy and sensitive to hyper-parameter choices.

Method: T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a single inexpensive forward pass based on natural language description of the target task.

Result: T2L matches the performance of task-specific adapters across test sets and can compress hundreds of LoRA instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks.

Conclusion: T2L provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute requirements.

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach
provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of
foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute
requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/text-to-lora

TL;DR: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential, but existing GNNs don't consider the conservation law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources. To solve this problem, the paper proposes flow attention which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy Kirchhoff's first law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs do not take into account the conservation law inherent in graphs related to the flow of physical resources, which can lead to reduced model performance.

Method: Propose flow attention, which modifies existing graph attention mechanisms to meet Kirchhoff's first law.

Result: Through extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power grids), it is proved that flow attention improves the performance of attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

Conclusion: Flow attention not only satisfies Kirchhoff's first law, but also enhances the expressivity of GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation
law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as
electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which
can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow
attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy
Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification
influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can
be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through
extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power
grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of
attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

*Thomas Borsani,Andrea Rosani,Giuseppe Nicosia,Giuseppe Di Fatta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery (SAM-GS), a novel gradient surgery method for Multi-Task Deep Learning (MTDL) that uses gradient magnitude similarity to guide optimization and improve convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-task learning faces challenges in backpropagation training, especially when conflicting gradients hinder the concurrent convergence of multiple tasks. Existing gradient surgery methods aim to address these issues by adjusting overall gradient trajectory.

Method: The SAM-GS method introduces gradient magnitude similarity as a measure to guide the optimisation process. It incorporates gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order momentum to effectively deal with conflicting gradients in MTDL.

Result: Experimental tests on synthetic problems and MTL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SAM-GS in improving convergence speed and stability in multi-task learning scenarios.

Conclusion: Gradient magnitude similarity is vital for regularising gradient aggregation in MTDL, and SAM-GS provides an effective and scalable approach to enhance the optimisation of the learning process.

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

TL;DR: Table reasoning is challenging for small language models. This paper proposes Table-r1, a two-stage method designed for SLMs to overcome limitations in program-based table reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To narrow the gap between small and large language models in table reasoning by exploring program-based TR (P-TR) which generates executable programs instead of text-based reasoning.

Method: The method involves two stages: Stage 1 introduces Layout Transformation Inference for better tabular layout generalization; Stage 2 uses a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization for enhancing consistency and allowing fallback to text-based reasoning when necessary.

Result: Experiments on four TR benchmarks show that Table-r1 outperforms all SLM-based methods with at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base model (LLaMA-8B) and reaches performance competitive with LLMs.

Conclusion: Table-r1 effectively addresses the challenges of applying P-TR to SLMs, significantly improving their table reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.
Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all
SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base
model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with
LLMs.

Motivation: To ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO methods, the authors propose carps, a benchmark framework that allows comprehensive evaluation of optimizers on various HPO tasks.

Method: The carps framework focuses on four key HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective, and multi-fidelity-multi-objective. It provides a large set of 3,336 tasks from 5 community benchmarks and 28 optimizer variants. The framework includes an analysis pipeline and functionality to create subsets of representative tasks by minimizing star discrepancy, enabling efficient evaluations.

Result: carps offers the biggest library to date for HPO evaluation, with initial subsets of 10 to 30 diverse tasks per task type. Baseline results are established for future comparisons, facilitating standardized HPO evaluation.

Conclusion: With carps, the authors make a significant step towards standardizing HPO evaluation, providing a comprehensive and scalable framework for comparing optimizers.

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing
machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO
methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated
Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark
tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important
types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and
multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark
collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to
library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies
on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and
benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the
evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of
tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.
To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the
star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a
result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task
type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become
available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of
baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps
(https://www.github.com/automl/CARP-S), we make an important step in the
standardization of HPO evaluation.

### [135] [ENMA: Tokenwise Autoregression for Generative Neural PDE Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06158)
*Armand Kassaï Koupaï,Lise Le Boudec,Louis Serrano,Patrick Gallinari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ENMA is a generative neural operator that predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space, allowing for robust and adaptable modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving time-dependent parametric PDEs is challenging, especially when generalizing across various physical parameters and dynamics. When data is uncertain or incomplete, generative models become a natural approach.

Method: ENMA uses a generative masked autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss to predict future dynamics in a compressed latent space. Spatial observations are encoded into uniform latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder.

Result: ENMA performs in-context learning at inference time by conditioning on past states or auxiliary context trajectories, leading to a robust and adaptable framework.

Conclusion: ENMA generalizes to new PDE regimes and supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when
generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data
is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

*Tianyi Alex Qiu,Zhonghao He,Tejasveer Chugh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how the feedback loop between large language models (LLMs) and human users creates an echo chamber that entrenches existing values and beliefs, leading to a loss of diversity. Empirical tests with agent-based LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data show drops in diversity after new GPT releases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of the feedback loop between LLMs and human users on belief systems and diversity.

Method: Formalizing the hypothesis and testing it empirically using agent-based LLM simulations and analyzing real-world GPT usage data.

Result: Analysis reveals sudden but sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations, supporting the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop.

Conclusion: The feedback loop with human users entrenches existing values and beliefs, potentially locking in false beliefs and reducing diversity.

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

### [137] [Reusing Trajectories in Policy Gradients Enables Fast Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06178)
*Alessandro Montenegro,Federico Mansutti,Marco Mussi,Matteo Papini,Alberto Maria Metelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policy gradient (PG) methods are effective for continuous control problems but sample-inefficient. This paper introduces RPG, which reuses past off-policy trajectories and achieves a better sample complexity of O~(ε^-1).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PG methods require significant data to converge efficiently, often needing O(ε^-2) trajectories to reach an ε-approximate stationary point. Reusing off-policy information has been explored, improving rates to O(ε^-3/2), but trajectory reuse remains largely unexplored theoretically.

Method: The authors introduce the Retrospective Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm that combines old and new trajectories for policy updates using a power mean correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator. This approach rigorously explores the reuse of past off-policy trajectories in PG methods.

Result: Under established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of O~(ε^-1), which is the best known rate in the literature. Empirical results validate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art PG methods.

Conclusion: RPG demonstrates that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods, providing rigorous theoretical evidence and practical improvements.

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These
methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient
ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy
gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.
Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve
efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as
previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received
substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored
from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous
theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can
significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean
correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG
(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new
trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under
established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We
further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with
state-of-the-art rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自注意力机制已经成为现代神经网络架构的核心组件，但其理论基础尚不明确，因此需要深入研究自注意力机制的能力及应用范围。

Method: 通过将自注意力机制视为实体间交互的视角，研究其在多智能体强化学习到基因序列等领域的表现，并提出HyperFeatureAttention和HyperAttention两个新模块以分别学习特征级交互和多实体依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，自注意力机制可以学习交互函数并在不同人群分布和分布外场景中进行泛化。提出的两个新模块也展示了良好的性能。

Conclusion: 自注意力机制在最小假设条件下可作为相互作用学习器，适用于广泛的现实世界领域，并且提出了两个新模块来进一步扩展其能力。

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural
architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper,
we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from
agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences,
and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent,
learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as
a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of
interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide
variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical
insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns
interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce
HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn
couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities.
Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond
pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way,
four-way, or general n-way interactions.

*Jing Jia,Sifan Liu,Bowen Song,Wei Yuan,Liyue Shen,Guanyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In this paper, researchers systematically studied the antithetic initial noise in diffusion models and found that pairing each initial noise with its negation yields strongly negatively correlated samples. They explained this phenomenon through experiments and theoretical analysis, proposed a symmetry conjecture about the learned score function, and provided supporting evidence. Based on these findings, they enabled two applications: enhancing image diversity without quality loss and sharpening uncertainty quantification when estimating downstream statistics. They also extended the two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator to further improve estimation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this study is to systematically investigate the effects of antithetic initial noise in diffusion models and understand why pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields strongly negatively correlated samples across various types of diffusion models.

Method: The method involved combining experiments and theoretical analysis to explore the phenomenon of negative correlation in samples. The researchers proposed a symmetry conjecture that the learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up to a constant shift) and provided evidence supporting it. They then leveraged this negative correlation for two applications: enhancing image diversity and sharpening uncertainty quantification. Finally, they extended the two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator.

Result: The results showed that by leveraging the negative correlation, they could enhance image diversity in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss and sharpen uncertainty quantification when estimating downstream statistics, achieving narrower confidence intervals. Extending the two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator further improved estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion models has led to a better understanding of the phenomenon and enabled practical applications such as enhancing image diversity and improving uncertainty quantification. The framework is training-free, model-agnostic, and adds no runtime overhead.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

*Luis Kin Miyatake,Eduardo Camponogara,Eric Aislan Antonelo,Alexey Pavlov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends the PINC framework to PDEs for modeling and controlling single-phase flows, using neural networks and physical laws without labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in modeling and controlling single-phase flow systems governed by PDEs, particularly under transient conditions.

Method: The PINC model for PDEs consists of two stages - a steady-state network and a transient network. A simplifying assumption is proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, enabling efficient training.

Result: The PINC model accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control applications, validated through numerical experiments. It can efficiently approximate PDE solutions without iterative solvers.

Conclusion: PINC is a promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering applications.

Abstract: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) present challenges, especially under transient
conditions. In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for
Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces ICU-TSB, a benchmark for patient stratification using temporal data from ICU EHRs. It includes a hierarchical evaluation framework and compares different methods for generating patient representations. Results show that temporal representation learning can identify clinically meaningful patient groups, but it's still challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patient stratification is crucial for personalized medicine. The authors aim to leverage the rich temporal clinical data in ICU EHRs for this purpose.

Method: Introduced ICU-TSB, a benchmark for evaluating patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning. Used three publicly available ICU EHR datasets and a novel hierarchical evaluation framework. Compared statistical methods and recurrent neural networks (LSTM and GRU) for generating effective patient representations.

Result: Temporal representation learning can rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts. V-measure scores vary from 0.46 at the top level of the taxonomy to 0.40 at the lowest level. Multiple strategies were evaluated for assigning interpretable labels to identified clusters.

Conclusion: The task of patient stratification through temporal representation learning remains challenging but promising. The experiments and benchmark are fully reproducible.

Abstract: Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is
essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and
treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from
intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be
leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal
Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using
three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark
is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to
measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease
groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and
several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to
generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient
trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can
rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a
challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of
the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the
practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for
assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and
benchmark are fully reproducible and available at

### [142] [Transformative or Conservative? Conservation laws for ResNets and Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06194)
*Sibylle Marcotte,Rémi Gribonval,Gabriel Peyré*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores conservation laws in training dynamics for modern architectures like convolutional ResNets and Transformers, identifying new principles and examining their persistence under discrete optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conservation laws are well understood for shallow ReLU and linear networks, but not much explored for practical architectures such as convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks.

Method: The authors derive and analyze conservation laws for modern architectures. They first show conservation laws for basic building blocks, describe all conservation laws for a single attention layer, and demonstrate that residual blocks have the same conservation laws as without skip connections. Then they introduce conservation laws depending on a subset of parameters and reduce the characterization to analyzing isolated building blocks. Finally, they examine how these laws persist under discrete optimization dynamics.

Result: New conservation laws were identified for modern architectures including convolutional ResNets and Transformers. The persistence of these laws was examined under discrete optimization dynamics such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Conclusion: This study bridges the gap in understanding conservation laws for practical deep learning architectures, providing insights into their training dynamics.

Abstract: While conservation laws in gradient flow training dynamics are well
understood for (mostly shallow) ReLU and linear networks, their study remains
largely unexplored for more practical architectures. This paper bridges this
gap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with
a focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first
show that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with
or without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more
than the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also
completely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks
have the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We
then introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of
parameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual
block, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of
such laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in
isolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation
principles, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,
persist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

### [143] [How to craft a deep reinforcement learning policy for wind farm flow control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06204)
*Elie Kadoche,Pascal Bianchi,Florence Carton,Philippe Ciblat,Damien Ernst*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new deep reinforcement learning method for wake steering control in wind farms, which uses graph attention networks and multi-head self-attention blocks to optimize turbine yaw angles. It requires fewer training steps and increases energy production by up to 14%. This is the first controller that generalizes across any time-varying wind conditions in low-fidelity simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce overall energy production in wind farms. Current machine learning approaches for wake steering control are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms, so there is a need for a more robust controller that works in time-varying wind conditions.

Method: The authors developed a novel deep reinforcement learning architecture combining graph attention networks and multi-head self-attention blocks with a new reward function and training strategy. The model calculates optimal turbine yaw angles to maximize energy production in time-varying wind conditions.

Result: The proposed model needs about 10 times fewer training steps compared to a fully connected neural network and shows more robust performance than a strong optimization baseline, achieving up to 14% increase in energy production in steady-state, low-fidelity simulations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the new deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering controller, which generalizes well across various time-varying wind conditions in low-fidelity simulations.

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce
overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed
to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,
for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the
wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust
wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning
approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.
This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a
wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces
a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head
self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.
The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy
production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on
steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires
approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural
network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization
baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering
controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in
a low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MGCL, a model-driven graph contrastive learning framework that uses graphons to guide contrastive learning and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is powerful for self-supervised learning of node or graph representations without labeled data, but existing methods rely on manual augmentation strategies not tailored to the underlying data distribution.

Method: MGCL estimates the graphon associated with observed data and defines a graphon-informed augmentation process. For graph-level tasks, it clusters the dataset and estimates a graphon per group.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Incorporating generative models into GCL provides principled augmentations and reflects shared semantics and structure.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL)
framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs)
to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying
generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated
labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented
views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various
downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation
strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and
operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs
generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first
estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a
graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled
augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset
and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared
semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.

TL;DR: Autoregressive language models have error accumulation problems due to their fixed left-to-right token generation.

Method: The proposed method is called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). It mitigates error accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a window of previously generated text.

Result: Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B resulted in approximately 10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks compared to standard sampling.

Conclusion: This method can be integrated into existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality and speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called Spectral Pairwise Embedding Comparison (SPEC) to compare feature embeddings by analyzing differences in clustering within embedding spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing comparisons of feature embeddings mainly focus on their numerical performance in classification-related downstream applications, but lack an interpretable comparison method that identifies and analyzes mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding spaces.

Method: SPEC examines kernel matrices derived from two embeddings and uses the eigendecomposition of the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters captured differently. It also includes an optimization problem to align two embeddings ensuring clusters identified in one are also captured in the other model.

Result: SPEC is demonstrated to effectively compare and align embeddings on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO.

Conclusion: The authors provide a scalable implementation of SPEC with computational complexity linearly growing with sample size, and make the code available online.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy
from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups
with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior
electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key
contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures
of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

*Guillaume Pourcel,Debabrota Basu,Maxence Ernoult,Aditya Gilra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Generalized Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP) that extends the variational formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. It shows that Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) is a special case of GLEP and has desirable properties for hardware implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in extending the Equilibrium Propagation (EP) algorithm from static inputs to time-varying inputs, which is a challenging problem due to the need for applying variational description to system trajectories rather than just fixed points and considering boundary conditions.

Method: The method involves proposing GLEP to extend the variational formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. The study demonstrates that different learning algorithms result depending on the boundary conditions of the system and derives HEL as a special case of GLEP.

Result: GLEP successfully extends EP to time-varying inputs. Among its derived algorithms, HEL stands out as it inherits the favorable properties of EP, such as forward-only operation, efficient scaling, and enabling local learning.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that GLEP provides a framework to extend EP to time-varying inputs and HEL is a practical instance with advantageous characteristics for hardware implementations.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training
Energy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational
description of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a
challenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire
system trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of
boundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized
Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational
formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields
different learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the
system, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that
Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed
Recurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation
(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is
the only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a
desirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it
operates in a "forward-only" manner (i.e. using the same system for both
inference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more
passes through the system regardless of model size), and enables local
learning.

### [149] [Distillation Robustifies Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06278)
*Bruce W. Lee,Addie Foote,Alex Infanger,Leni Shor,Harish Kamath,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Bryce Woodworth,Alex Cloud,Alexander Matt Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current LLM unlearning methods are easily reverted. Even idealized methods using output-based finetuning are insufficient for robust unlearning. The study finds that training a randomly initialized student model to imitate an unlearned model can transfer desired behaviors while discarding undesired ones, indicating distillation enhances unlearning. They propose UNDO, which distills an unlearned model into a partially noised copy, introducing a tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness. UNDO achieves similar robustness to retraining from scratch with less computational cost and minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue that current LLM unlearning methods lack robustness as they can be easily reverted through finetuning, even when using an idealized method of training to imitate an oracle model not exposed to unwanted information.

Method: Propose UNDO (Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs), a scalable method that distills an unlearned model into a partially noised version of itself, leveraging the insight that distillation strengthens unlearning by transferring desired behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind.

Result: UNDO establishes a new Pareto frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks, achieving robustness comparable to retraining from scratch with perfect data filtering but at 60-80% of the computational cost and requiring only 0.01% of pretraining data to be labeled. It also demonstrates effectiveness on the WMDP benchmark.

Conclusion: UNDO offers a convenient and efficient approach to robust capability removal in LLMs by incorporating an unlearning step before distillation.

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

### [150] [Eigenspectrum Analysis of Neural Networks without Aspect Ratio Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06280)
*Yuanzhe Hu,Kinshuk Goel,Vlad Killiakov,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces FARMS, a method that normalizes weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio to mitigate the bias in estimating heavytailness metrics of DNNs. This improves eigenspectrum analysis accuracy and layer-wise hyperparameter assignment across various domains including CV, SciML, and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing deep neural networks using eigenspectrum analysis has become an important research area. However, there is a challenge regarding the impact of the aspect ratio of weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and hyperparameter assignment.

Method: FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling) is proposed to normalize weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, the average ESD of these subsampled submatrices is measured to effectively mitigate the aspect ratio bias.

Result: FARMS uniformly improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in various application domains. In LLM pruning experiments, it reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model by 17.3% compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: FARMS addresses the issue of aspect ratio bias in eigenspectrum analysis, leading to more accurate model diagnosis and better hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

However, dynamic vehicle mobility and diverse trust boundaries introduce
critical security challenges. This paper presents a novel Zero-Trust
Mobility-Aware Authentication Framework (ZTMAF) for secure communication in VFC
networks. The framework employs context-aware authentication with lightweight
cryptographic primitives, a decentralized trust evaluation system, and fog
node-assisted session validation to combat spoofing, replay, and impersonation
attacks. Simulation results on NS-3 and SUMO demonstrate improved
authentication latency, reduced computational overhead, and better scalability

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes an AI-driven dynamic firewall optimization framework using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that can adapt and update firewall rules in real-time. Trained on NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017 datasets, it shows improvements in detection accuracy, false positive reduction, and rule update latency compared to traditional firewalls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static firewalls are becoming ineffective against the growing complexity of cyber threats in dynamic, real-time intrusion prevention.

Method: The method uses a Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that observes network states, detects anomalies via a hybrid LSTM-CNN model, and dynamically modifies firewall configurations accordingly.

Result: Significant improvements were observed in detection accuracy, false positive rates, and rule update latency when compared to traditional signature- and behavior-based firewalls.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-driven dynamic firewall optimization framework offers a scalable and autonomous solution for improving network resilience against complex attack vectors.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber threats has rendered static firewalls
increasingly ineffective for dynamic, real-time intrusion prevention. This
paper proposes a novel AI-driven dynamic firewall optimization framework that
leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to autonomously adapt and update
firewall rules in response to evolving network threats. Our system employs a
Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, where the RL agent observes network
states, detects anomalies using a hybrid LSTM-CNN model, and dynamically
modifies firewall configurations to mitigate risks. We train and evaluate our
framework on the NSL-KDD and CIC-IDS2017 datasets using a simulated
software-defined network environment. Results demonstrate significant
improvements in detection accuracy, false positive reduction, and rule update
latency when compared to traditional signature- and behavior-based firewalls.
The proposed method provides a scalable, autonomous solution for enhancing
network resilience against complex attack vectors in both enterprise and
critical infrastructure settings.

*S. D. Cardell,A. Fuúter-Sabater,V. Requena,M. Beltrá*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new bijection between Boolean functions and binary sequences with period as power of two, establishing connections to study their properties mutually. It defines a new sequence representation called reverse-ANF, studies its relation with other representations, and analyzes generalized self-shrinking sequences using these tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a new way to study the properties of Boolean functions and binary sequences by establishing a connection between them.

Method: Introduce a new bijection between Boolean functions and binary sequences, define a new representation (reverse-ANF) based on algebraic normal form, and analyze generalized self-shrinking sequences in terms of Boolean functions.

Result: Established a novel method for studying properties of Boolean functions via binary sequences and vice versa. Defined and analyzed the reverse-ANF representation and its relations with other representations.

Conclusion: The introduced bijection and reverse-ANF representation provide effective tools for analyzing Boolean functions and binary sequences, particularly generalized self-shrinking sequences.

Abstract: Boolean functions and binary sequences are main tools used in cryptography.
In this work, we introduce a new bijection between the set of Boolean functions
and the set of binary sequences with period a power of two. We establish a
connection between them which allows us to study some properties of Boolean
functions through binary sequences and vice versa. Then, we define a new
representation of sequences, based on Boolean functions and derived from the
algebraic normal form, named reverse-ANF. Next, we study the relation between
such a representation and other representations of Boolean functions as well as
between such a representation and the binary sequences. Finally, we analyse the
generalized self-shrinking sequences in terms of Boolean functions and some of
their properties using the different representations.

### [154] [A Red Teaming Roadmap Towards System-Level Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05376)
*Zifan Wang,Christina Q. Knight,Jeremy Kritz,Willow E. Primack,Julian Michael*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper argues that current LLM red teaming research does not prioritize the right problems, suggesting focusing on product safety specifications, realistic threat models, and system-level safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inadequacies in current LLM red teaming research by shifting focus to more practical and urgent issues such as safety specifications, realistic threats, and system-level safety.

Method: The method involves critiquing existing LLM red teaming research and proposing a shift in priorities towards testing against clear product safety specifications, adopting realistic threat models, and considering system-level safety.

Result: The result is a call for a change in the direction of LLM red teaming research to better address emerging threats from rapid AI advancements.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the necessity of adopting these new priorities to effectively tackle the evolving threats posed by AI advancements.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safeguards, which implement request refusals, have
become a widely adopted mitigation strategy against misuse. At the intersection
of adversarial machine learning and AI safety, safeguard red teaming has
effectively identified critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art
refusal-trained LLMs. However, in our view the many conference submissions on
LLM red teaming do not, in aggregate, prioritize the right research problems.
First, testing against clear product safety specifications should take a higher
priority than abstract social biases or ethical principles. Second, red teaming
should prioritize realistic threat models that represent the expanding risk
landscape and what real attackers might do. Finally, we contend that
system-level safety is a necessary step to move red teaming research forward,
as AI models present new threats as well as affordances for threat mitigation
(e.g., detection and banning of malicious users) once placed in a deployment
context. Adopting these priorities will be necessary in order for red teaming
research to adequately address the slate of new threats that rapid AI advances
present today and will present in the very near future.

*Linlin Liang,Zongkai Tian,Haiyan Huang,Xiaoyan Li,Zhisheng Yin,Dehua Zhang,Nina Zhang,Wenchao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores secure transmissions in IRS-assisted NOMA systems with heterogeneous resource configuration, proposing a CO-GNN approach to optimize system parameters and enhance secure transmission performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IRS enhances spectral efficiency and NOMA increases system capacity, but the passive nature of IRS and multi-user signal superposition in NOMA introduce external and internal eavesdropping risks.

Method: A combinatorial optimization graph neural network (CO-GNN) approach is proposed to jointly optimize beamforming at the base station, power allocation of NOMA users, and phase shifts of IRS for dynamic heterogeneous resource allocation.

Result: Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the secure transmission performance of the system.

Conclusion: The CO-GNN algorithm simplifies problem-solving, eliminates the need for channel estimation, and enhances scalability.

Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) enhance spectral efficiency by
adjusting reflection phase shifts, while Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)
increases system capacity. Consequently, IRS-assisted NOMA communications have
garnered significant research interest. However, the passive nature of the IRS,
lacking authentication and security protocols, makes these systems vulnerable
to external eavesdropping due to the openness of electromagnetic signal
propagation and reflection. NOMA's inherent multi-user signal superposition
also introduces internal eavesdropping risks during user pairing. This paper
investigates secure transmissions in IRS-assisted NOMA systems with
heterogeneous resource configuration in wireless networks to mitigate both
external and internal eavesdropping. To maximize the sum secrecy rate of
legitimate users, we propose a combinatorial optimization graph neural network
(CO-GNN) approach to jointly optimize beamforming at the base station, power
allocation of NOMA users, and phase shifts of IRS for dynamic heterogeneous
resource allocation, thereby enabling the design of dual-link or multi-link
secure transmissions in the presence of eavesdroppers on the same or
heterogeneous links. The CO-GNN algorithm simplifies the complex mathematical
problem-solving process, eliminates the need for channel estimation, and
enhances scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm significantly enhances the secure transmission performance of the
system.

Motivation: 当前最先进的黑盒对抗攻击方法往往只关注其中一个评估标准，而忽略了其他重要属性。

Method: 提出了一种名为ECLIPSE的新方法，该方法使用对采样梯度进行高斯模糊处理以及构建局部替代模型来生成对抗样本。

Result: 在公开数据集上的广泛实验表明，ECLIPSE在三个关键属性（压缩鲁棒性、自动检测隐蔽性和人工检查隐蔽性）之间取得了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: ECLIPSE为黑盒对抗攻击提供了一个有效的解决方案，并促进了在不同攻击属性之间取得平衡的研究。

Abstract: Deep learning systems, critical in domains like autonomous vehicles, are
vulnerable to adversarial examples (crafted inputs designed to mislead
classifiers). This study investigates black-box adversarial attacks in computer
vision. This is a realistic scenario, where attackers have query-only access to
the target model. Three properties are introduced to evaluate attack
feasibility: robustness to compression, stealthiness to automatic detection,
and stealthiness to human inspection. State-of-the-Art methods tend to
prioritize one criterion at the expense of others. We propose ECLIPSE, a novel
attack method employing Gaussian blurring on sampled gradients and a local
surrogate model. Comprehensive experiments on a public dataset highlight
ECLIPSE's advantages, demonstrating its contribution to the trade-off between
the three properties.

*Hondamunige Prasanna Silva,Federico Becattini,Lorenzo Seidenari*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of vision foundation models (specifically CLIP and ViTs) to adversarial attacks, introduces a new attack method that exploits transformer-based architecture in a task-agnostic way, and demonstrates its effectiveness across various downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the increasing reliance on pre-trained foundation models like CLIP and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in AI applications, which brings significant security concerns due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks.

Method: The researchers introduce a novel adversarial attack targeting the structure of transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic manner. This attack is designed to be effective against vision foundation models such as CLIP and ViTs.

Result: The attack proves effective on several downstream tasks including classification, captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation, and depth estimation, showing high transferability of adversarial examples.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and the newly introduced attack highlights these vulnerabilities by successfully affecting various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in
artificial intelligence.Foundation models are large models, trained on broad
data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without
fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers
(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.
However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces
significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive
AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability.This paper studies the
vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and
ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream
tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of
transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion.We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification,
captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

*Yuan Xun,Siyuan Liang,Xiaojun Jia,Xinwei Liu,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在使用受污染数据微调时容易受到隐秘后门攻击。本文提出一种轻量级防御框架——鲁棒指令微调，通过仅微调适配器模块和文本嵌入层，并结合输入多样性正则化和异常激活正则化，有效降低后门攻击成功率至几乎为零，且训练成本增加不到15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后门防御技术通常适用于单模态模型或需要调整全部参数的场景，或者依赖于训练期间的监督知识。然而，在实际应用中，防御者无法修改冻结的视觉编码器或核心LLM参数，也不具备未知触发模式或目标响应的先验知识。因此，研究者希望设计一种无需访问核心权重或攻击先验的防御方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为鲁棒指令微调的轻量级、认证无关的防御框架。该方法仅对适配器模块和文本嵌入层进行微调，并结合两种互补的正则化机制：(1) 输入多样性正则化，通过扰动训练样本中的触发组件来破坏一致的虚假提示；(2) 异常激活正则化，动态稀疏化与后门模式相关联的异常尖锐激活的适配器权重。

Result: 在Flickr30k和MSCOCO数据集上针对七种攻击的广泛实验表明，该方法能够将攻击成功率降低到几乎为零，同时训练成本增加不到15%。

Conclusion: 鲁棒指令微调是一种有效的防御框架，能够在不访问核心权重或攻击先验的情况下，显著降低后门攻击的成功率，同时保持较低的计算开销。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated excellent
instruction-following capabilities, yet remain vulnerable to stealthy backdoor
attacks when finetuned using contaminated data. Existing backdoor defense
techniques are usually developed for single-modal visual or language models
under fully parameter-adjustable settings or rely on supervisory knowledge
during training. However, in real-world scenarios, defenders cannot modify
frozen visual encoders or core LLM parameters, nor possess prior knowledge of
unknown trigger patterns or target responses. Motivated by the empirical
finding that LVLMs readily overfit to fixed, unknown triggers, which can embed
malicious associations during adapter-level tuning, we aim to design a defense
that operates without access to core weights or attack priors. To this end, we
introduce a lightweight, certified-agnostic defense framework, Robust
Instruction Tuning, that finetunes only adapter modules and text embedding
layers under instruction tuning. Our method integrates two complementary
regularizations: (1) Input Diversity Regularization, which perturbs trigger
components across training samples to disrupt consistent spurious cues; and (2)
Anomalous Activation Regularization, which dynamically sparses adapter weights
exhibiting abnormally sharp activations linked to backdoor patterns. These
mechanisms jointly guide the model toward learning semantically grounded
representations rather than memorizing superficial trigger-response mappings.
  Extensive experiments against seven attacks on Flickr30k and MSCOCO
demonstrate that ours
  reduces their attack success rate to nearly zero, with an increase in
training cost of less than 15%.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 在边缘计算中，大型预训练模型的部署越来越普遍，但容易受到对抗性攻击。联邦对抗训练（FAT）虽然能提高模型鲁棒性并保护隐私，但难以应对客户数据分布的异构性，并且存在通信挑战。本文提出了一种名为Sylva的个性化协作对抗训练框架，通过两阶段过程为每个客户提供定制化的防御模型。第一阶段使用LoRA进行本地对抗微调，减少通信成本；第二阶段采用基于博弈论的层选择策略，提升良性数据上的准确性。实验表明，Sylva在通信效率、对抗鲁棒性和良性准确性上都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦对抗训练方法虽然有效，但生成的通用全局模型无法适应不同客户的异构数据分布，导致个性化性能不足，同时面临通信负担大的问题。因此，需要一种新的框架来解决这些问题，提供个性化的防御模型并降低通信成本。

Method: Sylva框架包含两个阶段：
1. 第一阶段利用LoRA技术进行本地对抗微调，允许客户根据自身需求个性化模型鲁棒性，并仅上传LoRA参数以大幅减少通信开销。
2. 第二阶段引入基于博弈论的层选择策略，优化模型在良性数据上的准确性，进一步完善个性化模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有最先进的算法相比，Sylva能够将通信效率提升50倍，同时分别提高29.5%的对抗鲁棒性和50.4%的良性准确性。

Conclusion: Sylva框架成功解决了联邦对抗训练中的个性化和通信问题，通过两阶段方法实现了高效的个性化防御模型生成，在保持模型鲁棒性的同时提升了准确性和通信效率。这为边缘计算环境下的模型安全部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing adoption of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made
deploying model inference on mobile clients both practical and popular. These
devices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a
substantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated
adversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance
model robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently
produces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and
heterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently
personalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication
challenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework
designed to deliver customized defense models for each client through a
two-phase process. In Phase 1, \textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local
adversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while
drastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters
during federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy
is introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the
personalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored
defense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textit{Sylva} can achieve
up to 50$\times$ improvements in communication efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.5\% and 50.4\%
enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively.

*Ruba Nasser,Ahmed Alagha,Shakti Singh,Rabeb Mizouni,Hadi Otrok,Jamal Bentahar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes an adversarial attack using GANs to generate poisoning points that mislead behavioral-based selection models in Mobile Crowdsensing, showing its effectiveness in compromising the model and reducing payments to victim workers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of AI-based tools in Mobile Crowdsensing systems, specifically focusing on how malicious insiders can exploit these vulnerabilities to harm worker selection models.

Method: The method involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create poisoning points that mislead the training of behavioral-based selection models without being detected by outlier detectors.

Result: Simulation results indicate that the proposed attack successfully compromises the victim workers' model and evades detection better than a benchmark approach. The impact on reducing payments to victim workers is also significant.

Conclusion: The integration of AI in Mobile Crowdsensing introduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited via adversarial attacks, such as the one proposed using GANs, which effectively compromises worker selection models.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based tools
and components are becoming omnipresent in today's solutions. However, these
components and tools are posing a significant threat when it comes to
adversarial attacks. Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that
leverages the collective participation of workers and their smart devices to
collect data. One of the key challenges faced at the selection stage is
ensuring task completion due to workers' varying behavior. AI has been utilized
to tackle this challenge by building unique models for each worker to predict
their behavior. However, the integration of AI into the system introduces
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious insiders to reduce the
revenue obtained by victim workers. This work proposes an adversarial attack
targeting behavioral-based selection models in MCS. The proposed attack
leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate poisoning points
that can mislead the models during the training stage without being detected.
This way, the potential damage introduced by GANs on worker selection in MCS
can be anticipated. Simulation results using a real-life dataset show the
effectiveness of the proposed attack in compromising the victim workers' model
and evading detection by an outlier detector, compared to a benchmark. In
addition, the impact of the attack on reducing the payment obtained by victim
workers is evaluated.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Private Contrastive Evolution (PCEvolve), a new algorithm that improves upon Private Evolution (PE) for generating high-quality Differential Privacy (DP) synthetic images, especially in few-shot private data scenarios. It leverages inter-class contrastive relationships and an adapted Exponential Mechanism to enhance DP utility. Experiments show PCEvolve outperforms existing methods.


<details>

Motivation: Private Evolution (PE) struggles with few-shot private data due to limitations in its DP-protected similarity voting approach, particularly affecting specialized domains like healthcare and industry.

Method: The proposed method, Private Contrastive Evolution (PCEvolve), iteratively mines inter-class contrastive relationships in few-shot private data and integrates them into an adapted Exponential Mechanism (EM) to optimize DP utility in an evolution loop.

Result: Extensive experiments on four specialized datasets demonstrate that PCEvolve outperforms PE and other API-assisted baselines in generating high-quality DP synthetic images.

Conclusion: PCEvolve highlights the potential of using API access with private data for quality evaluation, enabling better privacy-preserving generative API applications.

Abstract: The rise of generative APIs has fueled interest in privacy-preserving
synthetic data generation. While the Private Evolution (PE) algorithm generates
Differential Privacy (DP) synthetic images using diffusion model APIs, it
struggles with few-shot private data due to the limitations of its DP-protected
similarity voting approach. In practice, the few-shot private data challenge is
particularly prevalent in specialized domains like healthcare and industry. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel API-assisted algorithm, Private
Contrastive Evolution (PCEvolve), which iteratively mines inherent inter-class
contrastive relationships in few-shot private data beyond individual data
points and seamlessly integrates them into an adapted Exponential Mechanism
(EM) to optimize DP's utility in an evolution loop. We conduct extensive
experiments on four specialized datasets, demonstrating that PCEvolve
outperforms PE and other API-assisted baselines. These results highlight the
potential of leveraging API access with private data for quality evaluation,
enabling the generation of high-quality DP synthetic images and paving the way
for more accessible and effective privacy-preserving generative API
applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/TsingZ0/PCEvolve.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of data analysis that is particularly suited to
identifying coherent subgroups or substructures in unlabeled data, as are
generated continuously in large amounts these days. However, in many cases
traditional clustering methods are not applicable, because data are
increasingly being produced and stored in a distributed way, e.g. on edge
devices, and privacy concerns prevent it from being transferred to a central
server. To address this challenge, we present \acronym, a new algorithm for
$k$-means clustering that is fully-federated as well as differentially private.
Our approach leverages (potentially small and out-of-distribution) server-side
data to overcome the primary challenge of differentially private clustering
methods: the need for a good initialization. Combining our initialization with
a simple federated DP-Lloyds algorithm we obtain an algorithm that achieves
excellent results on synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks. We also provide
a theoretical analysis of our method that provides bounds on the convergence
speed and cluster identification success.

TL;DR: The paper presents QA-HFL, a framework for handling image quality heterogeneity in federated learning on mobile devices. It achieves high accuracy and privacy with efficient communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of varying image quality across resource-constrained mobile devices in federated learning environments.

Method: Trains specialized local models for different image quality levels, aggregates features using a quality-weighted fusion mechanism, and incorporates differential privacy protection.

Result: Achieves 92.31% accuracy on MNIST after three federation rounds, outperforming FedRolex (86.42%). Maintains 30.77% accuracy under strict privacy constraints. Low-end devices contribute significantly to the final model despite fewer parameters.

Conclusion: QA-HFL effectively handles image quality heterogeneity, maintains high accuracy and privacy, and outperforms baseline methods under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning
framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across
resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local
models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a
quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy
protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31%
accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy
constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential
privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most
significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters
than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy
decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent
client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining
efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis
confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01)
under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

### [164] [FERRET: Private Deep Learning Faster And Better Than DPSGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05416)
*David Zagardo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster, achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP, all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using zero additive noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information differential privacy (MI-DP) and propose a new method called FERRET that transmits at most one sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.

Method: FERRET uses Bernoulli masking to transmit at most one sign bit per parameter group. It proves that each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats and evaluates three granularities (FERRET-MAX, FERRET-EIGHTH, and FERRET-2) on five LLMs against DPSGD and Non-DP baselines.

Result: FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity across all settings. At epsilon=0.5 and 5 epochs, FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61 (2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25). MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower headroom. Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.

Conclusion: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of the privacy, utility, performance trilemma. FERRET trains up to 5x faster, achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP, all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using zero additive noise.

Abstract: We revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information
differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and
Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one
sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.
  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling
with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing
probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for
epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.
  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH
(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against
DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.
  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At
epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61
(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).
  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD
vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower
headroom.
  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of
DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.
  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of
the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,
achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,
all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using
zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked
1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TRIDENT is a three-tier propaganda detection model which integrates transformers, adversarial learning, and differential privacy to protect user privacy while maintaining high detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of propaganda on mobile platforms creates challenges around accurate detection and safeguarding user privacy.

Method: TRIDENT combines multilingual back-translation, character-level noise, entity obfuscation, syntactic obfuscation and label perturbation into a unified defense mechanism implemented through transformers and adversarial learning.

Result: Baseline transformer models achieved F1 scores of 0.89 (BERT) and 0.90 (GPT-2). With TRIDENT's third-tier defense, the cumulative F1 score reduced to 0.83, indicating strong privacy protection with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: TRIDENT successfully implements differential privacy in mobile machine learning deployments for propaganda detection, ensuring both high accuracy and strong user privacy.

Abstract: The proliferation of propaganda on mobile platforms raises critical concerns
around detection accuracy and user privacy. To address this, we propose TRIDENT
- a three-tier propaganda detection model implementing transformers,
adversarial learning, and differential privacy which integrates syntactic
obfuscation and label perturbation to mitigate privacy leakage while
maintaining propaganda detection accuracy. TRIDENT leverages multilingual
back-translation to introduce semantic variance, character-level noise, and
entity obfuscation for differential privacy enforcement, and combines these
techniques into a unified defense mechanism. Using a binary propaganda
classification dataset, baseline transformer models (BERT, GPT-2) we achieved
F1 scores of 0.89 and 0.90. Applying TRIDENT's third-tier defense yields a
reduced but effective cumulative F1 of 0.83, demonstrating strong privacy
protection across mobile ML deployments with minimal degradation.

*Mingjie Chen,Tiancheng Zhu,Mingxue Zhang,Yiling He,Minghao Lin,Penghui Li,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new optimization for adversarial attacks on Binary Code Similarity Detection (BCSD) models, which improves attack success rate, efficiency, and transferability by leveraging black-box explainers to identify critical code snippets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods of generating adversarial samples for evaluating BCSD model robustness rely on heuristics or greedy algorithms without solid theoretical basis and can be inefficient for complex programs.

Method: The proposed method uses black-box, model-agnostic explainers to interpret model decision boundaries and locate critical code snippets for applying semantic-preserving perturbations, focusing on targeted attacks that limit model predictions to a specific range.

Result: The evaluation shows higher attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods across almost all scenarios, with improved efficiency and transferability. Real-world case studies confirm the security implications of these attacks.

Conclusion: This work highlights the need to enhance the robustness of existing BCSD models against adversarial attacks through more effective and efficient methods.

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) serves as a fundamental technique for
various software engineering tasks, e.g., vulnerability detection and
classification. Attacks against such models have therefore drawn extensive
attention, aiming at misleading the models to generate erroneous predictions.
Prior works have explored various approaches to generating semantic-preserving
variants, i.e., adversarial samples, to evaluate the robustness of the models
against adversarial attacks. However, they have mainly relied on heuristic
criteria or iterative greedy algorithms to locate salient code influencing the
model output, failing to operate on a solid theoretical basis. Moreover, when
processing programs with high complexities, such attacks tend to be
time-consuming.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization for adversarial attacks against
BCSD models. In particular, we aim to improve the attacks in a challenging
scenario, where the attack goal is to limit the model predictions to a specific
range, i.e., the targeted attacks. Our attack leverages the superior capability
of black-box, model-agnostic explainers in interpreting the model decision
boundaries, thereby pinpointing the critical code snippet to apply
semantic-preserving perturbations. The evaluation results demonstrate that
compared with the state-of-the-art attacks, the proposed attacks achieve higher
attack success rate in almost all scenarios, while also improving the
efficiency and transferability. Our real-world case studies on vulnerability
detection and classification further demonstrate the security implications of
our attacks, highlighting the urgent need to further enhance the robustness of
existing BCSD models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly powerful but remain vulnerable
to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs cause the model to deviate
from its intended instructions. This paper introduces Sentinel, a novel
detection model, qualifire/prompt-injection-sentinel, based on the
\answerdotai/ModernBERT-large architecture. By leveraging ModernBERT's advanced
features and fine-tuning on an extensive and diverse dataset comprising a few
open-source and private collections, Sentinel achieves state-of-the-art
performance. This dataset amalgamates varied attack types, from role-playing
and instruction hijacking to attempts to generate biased content, alongside a
broad spectrum of benign instructions, with private datasets specifically
targeting nuanced error correction and real-world misclassifications. On a
comprehensive, unseen internal test set, Sentinel demonstrates an average
accuracy of 0.987 and an F1-score of 0.980. Furthermore, when evaluated on
public benchmarks, it consistently outperforms strong baselines like
protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2. This work details Sentinel's
architecture, its meticulous dataset curation, its training methodology, and a
thorough evaluation, highlighting its superior detection capabilities.

TL;DR: StealthInk是一种新的多比特水印方案，可以在不改变原始文本分布的情况下嵌入溯源数据，并且提供了快速可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM水印技术要么改变了生成文本的原始分布，要么仅限于嵌入零比特信息，无法进行识别。

Method: 提出了一种名为StealthInk的隐秘多比特水印方案，该方案可以在保持原始文本分布的同时，将如userID、TimeStamp和modelID等溯源数据嵌入到LLM生成的文本中。还推导出了在固定相等错误率下进行水印检测所需的最少令牌数量的下界，为提升容量提供了见解。

Result: 广泛的实证评估表明，StealthInk在各种任务中表现出良好的隐秘性、可检测性和弹性，证明了其作为LLM水印应用的有效解决方案的地位。

Conclusion: StealthInk提供了一种有效的方法来识别AI生成的文本，同时保持了原始文本的质量和特征，并增强了快速溯源能力。

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to
identifying AI-generated text. Existing approaches, however, either compromise
the distribution of original generated text by LLMs or are limited to embedding
zero-bit information that only allows for watermark detection but ignores
identification. We present StealthInk, a stealthy multi-bit watermarking scheme
that preserves the original text distribution while enabling the embedding of
provenance data, such as userID, TimeStamp, and modelID, within LLM-generated
text. This enhances fast traceability without requiring access to the language
model's API or prompts. We derive a lower bound on the number of tokens
necessary for watermark detection at a fixed equal error rate, which provides
insights on how to enhance the capacity. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse tasks highlight the stealthiness, detectability, and resilience
of StealthInk, establishing it as an effective solution for LLM watermarking
applications.

Conclusion: 本文的研究为理解LLMs中的水印技术提供了深入见解，并强调了开发针对LLMs部署的实际水印解决方案的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical
watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the security and privacy issues in the Nexagon protocol used for collecting geo-referenced data in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It applies threat modeling frameworks to identify vulnerabilities such as user re-identification, session linkage, and sparse-region attacks. An enhanced security architecture is proposed, combining public key infrastructure with ephemeral pseudonym certificates, which guarantees anonymity through randomized key rotation and adaptive geospatial resolution. The prototype implementation demonstrates its effectiveness without significantly increasing latency or reducing throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical security and privacy vulnerabilities that persist in the current specification of the Nexagon protocol, ensuring safe, secure, and anonymous data collection in ITS.

Method: Application of STRIDE and LINDDUN threat modeling frameworks to identify vulnerabilities in the Nexagon protocol. Proposal of an enhanced security architecture integrating public key infrastructure (PKI) with ephemeral pseudonym certificates, employing randomized key rotation and adaptive geospatial resolution.

Result: The proposed solution effectively mitigates re-identification and surveillance risks in sparse environments. Prototype implementation over a microservice-based overlay network validates the approach, showing only a 25% increase in latency and a 7% reduction in throughput.

Conclusion: It is feasible to achieve the required level of security in the Nexagon protocol without significantly compromising performance, making it ready for real-world deployment.

Abstract: A critical requirement for modern-day Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) is the ability to collect geo-referenced data from connected vehicles and
mobile devices in a safe, secure and anonymous way. The Nexagon protocol, which
builds on the IETF Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) and the Hierarchical
Hexagonal Clustering (H3) geo-spatial indexing system, offers a promising
framework for dynamic, privacy-preserving data aggregation. Seeking to address
the critical security and privacy vulnerabilities that persist in its current
specification, we apply the STRIDE and LINDDUN threat modelling frameworks and
prove among other that the Nexagon protocol is susceptible to user
re-identification, session linkage, and sparse-region attacks. To address these
challenges, we propose an enhanced security architecture that combines public
key infrastructure (PKI) with ephemeral pseudonym certificates. Our solution
guarantees user and device anonymity through randomized key rotation and
adaptive geospatial resolution, thereby effectively mitigating
re-identification and surveillance risks in sparse environments. A prototype
implementation over a microservice-based overlay network validates the approach
and underscores its readiness for real-world deployment. Our results show that
it is possible to achieve the required level of security without increasing
latency by more than 25% or reducing the throughput by more than 7%.

TL;DR: Federated Learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework for training LLMs while addressing privacy and security concerns. However, FL is vulnerable to inference attacks which threaten data privacy. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes FedShield-LLM that uses pruning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters.

Motivation: To address the vulnerabilities of Federated Learning to inference attacks and the degradation of model performance caused by Differential Privacy in LLM fine-tuning.

Method: The proposed method, FedShield-LLM, uses pruning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters. This enables secure computations on encrypted model updates while mitigating the attack surface by deactivating less important LoRA parameters. Optimized federated algorithms for cross-silo environments enhance scalability and efficiency.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of performance while ensuring robust privacy protection.

Conclusion: FedShield-LLM allows organizations to collaboratively train secure and efficient LLMs, making FL feasible for resource-constrained clients.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework for training and
fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging computational resources
across organizations while keeping sensitive data on local devices. It
addresses privacy and security concerns while navigating challenges associated
with the substantial computational demands of LLMs, which can be prohibitive
for small and medium-sized organizations. FL supports the development of
task-specific LLMs for cross-silo applications through fine-tuning but remains
vulnerable to inference attacks, such as membership inference and gradient
inversion, which threaten data privacy. Prior studies have utilized
Differential Privacy (DP) in LLM fine-tuning, which, despite being effective at
preserving privacy, can degrade model performance. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a novel method, FedShield-LLM, that uses pruning with
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) parameters,
enabling secure computations on encrypted model updates while mitigating the
attack surface by deactivating less important LoRA parameters. Furthermore,
optimized federated algorithms for cross-silo environments enhance scalability
and efficiency. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA
substantially reduce computational and communication overhead, making FL
feasible for resource-constrained clients. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing methods while maintaining robust privacy
protection, enabling organizations to collaboratively train secure and
efficient LLMs.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged
as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior
research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated
code. In this work, we introduce \benchmark, a benchmark specifically designed
to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide
range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types.
Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that
leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging
to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code.
Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on \benchmark, we
reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free

### [174] [Hybrid Stabilization Protocol for Cross-Chain Digital Assets Using Adaptor Signatures and AI-Driven Arbitrage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05708)
*Shengwei You,Andrey Kuehlkamp,Jarek Nabrzyski*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hybrid stabilization protocol for stablecoins that combines crypto-collateralized reserves, algorithmic futures contracts, and cross-chain liquidity pools to balance decentralization, stability, and regulatory compliance while preserving user privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stablecoins face the challenge of balancing decentralization, stability, and regulatory compliance, which is described as an unresolved trilemma. This necessitates the development of new protocols that can address these challenges simultaneously.

Method: The protocol uses stabilization futures contracts (SFCs) that programmatically incentivize third-party arbitrageurs to counteract price deviations via adaptor signature atomic swaps. Autonomous AI agents optimize delta hedging across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and zkSNARKs are employed to prove compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations without exposing identities or transaction details. The cryptographic design reduces cross-chain liquidity concentration and ensures atomicity under standard cryptographic assumptions.

Result: The cryptographic design reduces cross-chain liquidity concentration significantly (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index: 2,400 vs. 4,900 in single-chain systems) and provides robust price adherence while preserving user privacy.

Conclusion: The protocol's layered architecture, including incentive-compatible SFCs, AI-driven market making, and zero-knowledge regulatory proofs, serves as a blueprint for next-generation decentralized financial infrastructure.

Abstract: Stablecoins face an unresolved trilemma of balancing decentralization,
stability, and regulatory compliance. We present a hybrid stabilization
protocol that combines crypto-collateralized reserves, algorithmic futures
contracts, and cross-chain liquidity pools to achieve robust price adherence
while preserving user privacy. At its core, the protocol introduces
stabilization futures contracts (SFCs), non-collateralized derivatives that
programmatically incentivize third-party arbitrageurs to counteract price
deviations via adaptor signature atomic swaps. Autonomous AI agents optimize
delta hedging across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), while zkSNARKs prove
compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations without exposing
identities or transaction details. Our cryptographic design reduces cross-chain
liquidity concentration (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index: 2,400 vs. 4,900 in
single-chain systems) and ensures atomicity under standard cryptographic
assumptions. The protocol's layered architecture encompassing
incentive-compatible SFCs, AI-driven market making, and zero-knowledge
regulatory proofs. It provides a blueprint for next-generation decentralized
financial infrastructure.

*Saikat Gope,Srinivasan Krishnaswamy,Chayan Bhawal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents a post-quantum multirecipient symmetric cryptosystem based on the hardness of the LWE problem, allowing a sender to encrypt multiple messages for various recipients into one ciphertext, ensuring security and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a secure and efficient encryption method that can handle multiple recipients and tolerate noise in message types like images and sound.

Method: A single sender encrypts multiple messages intended for different recipients into a single ciphertext using a cryptosystem based on the LWE problem. Each recipient then decrypts this ciphertext with their own secret key to obtain their specific message without gaining information about other messages.

Result: The scheme is introduced, its security established based on the LWE problem, and an example demonstrating its application for encrypting multiple images is provided.

Conclusion: The proposed cryptosystem provides a secure way for a single sender to transmit personalized messages to multiple recipients while maintaining confidentiality.

Abstract: This article describes a post-quantum multirecipient symmetric cryptosystem
whose security is based on the hardness of the LWE problem. In this scheme a
single sender encrypts multiple messages for multiple recipients generating a
single ciphertext which is broadcast to the recipients. Each recipient decrypts
the ciphertext with her secret key to recover the message intended for her. In
this process, the recipient cannot efficiently extract any information about
the other messages. This scheme is intended for messages like images and sound
that can tolerate a small amount of noise. This article introduces the scheme
and establishes its security based on the LWE problem. Further, an example is
given to demonstrate the application of this scheme for encrypting multiple
images.

### [176] [There's Waldo: PCB Tamper Forensic Analysis using Explainable AI on Impedance Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05734)
*Maryam Saadat Safa,Seyedmohammad Nouraniboosjin,Fatemeh Ganji,Shahin Tajik*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of explainable AI (XAI) on impedance signatures for PCB forensics, achieving a detection accuracy of 96.7% with a random forest classifier and utilizing SHAP values to explain decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the increasing need for security in printed circuit boards (PCBs), particularly in detecting and identifying tampered components within electronic systems using non-invasive techniques.

Method: The method involves introducing a novel PCB forensics approach that uses explainable AI (XAI) on two-dimensional impedance signatures. This includes developing an XAI algorithm based on a random forest classifier, generating a dataset by replicating various PCB tamper events, and employing SHAP values to explain the decisions made by the classifier.

Result: The results show that the XAI algorithm achieves an accuracy of 96.7% in detecting tampering events and successfully explains which frequency component most influences the classifier's decision for a particular class.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that using explainable AI on impedance signatures not only enhances tamper detection capabilities but also significantly improves the ability to reverse-engineer and analyze these signatures for forensic purposes.

Abstract: The security of printed circuit boards (PCBs) has become increasingly vital
as supply chain vulnerabilities, including tampering, present significant risks
to electronic systems. While detecting tampering on a PCB is the first step for
verification, forensics is also needed to identify the modified component. One
non-invasive and reliable PCB tamper detection technique with global coverage
is the impedance characterization of a PCB's power delivery network (PDN).
However, it is an open question whether one can use the two-dimensional
impedance signatures for forensics purposes. In this work, we introduce a novel
PCB forensics approach using explainable AI (XAI) on impedance signatures.
Through extensive experiments, we replicate various PCB tamper events,
generating a dataset used to develop an XAI algorithm capable of not only
detecting tampering but also explaining why the algorithm makes a decision
about whether a tamper event has happened. At the core of our XAI algorithm is
a random forest classifier with an accuracy of 96.7%, sufficient to explain the
algorithm's decisions. To understand the behavior of the classifier in the
decision-making process, we utilized SHAP values as an XAI tool to determine
which frequency component influences the classifier's decision for a particular
class the most. This approach enhances detection capabilities as well as
advancing the verifier's ability to reverse-engineer and analyze
two-dimensional impedance signatures for forensics.

*Zhilong Wang,Neha Nagaraja,Lan Zhang,Hayretdin Bahsi,Pawan Patil,Peng Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A new defense mechanism named Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA) is proposed to protect LLM agents from prompt injection attacks with near-zero overhead by dynamically varying the structure of system prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, and traditional defenses have limitations in terms of effectiveness or convenience.

Method: The method involves dynamically changing the structure of system prompts to prevent attackers from predicting it, thus enhancing security.

Result: Experiments showed the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and its superiority when compared with other defense methods.

Conclusion: PPA is a lightweight and effective defense mechanism for protecting LLM agents from prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content
generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt
injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior.
Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are
either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel,
lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which
protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is
based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the
structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system
prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby
enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it
with other defense methods.

organizations, and society. This paper proposes the FIST Framework (Fraud
Incident Structured Threat Framework), an innovative structured threat modeling
methodology specifically designed for fraud scenarios. Inspired by MITRE
ATT\&CK and DISARM, FIST systematically incorporates social engineering
tactics, stage-based behavioral decomposition, and detailed attack technique
mapping into a reusable knowledge base. FIST aims to enhance the efficiency of
fraud detection and the standardization of threat intelligence sharing,
promoting collaboration and a unified language across organizations and
sectors. The framework integrates interdisciplinary insights from
cybersecurity, criminology, and behavioral science, addressing both technical
vectors and psychological manipulation mechanisms in fraud. This approach
enables fine-grained analysis of fraud incidents, supporting automated
detection, quantitative risk assessment, and standardized incident reporting.
The effectiveness of the framework is further validated through real-world case
studies, demonstrating its value in bridging academic research and practical
applications, and laying the foundation for an intelligence-driven anti-fraud
ecosystem. To the best of our knowledge, FIST is the first systematic,
open-source fraud threat modeling framework that unifies both technical and
psychological aspects, and is made freely available to foster collaboration
between academia and industry.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 预训练编码器模型在深度学习中具有出色的特征提取能力，但存在训练数据隐私泄漏的风险。本文研究了对比学习框架中成员推理攻击(MIAs)对编码器模型的隐私威胁，并提出了一种新的攻击方法——嵌入Lp范数似然攻击(LpLA)，该方法在攻击性能和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练编码器模型在深度学习中表现出色，但其广泛应用引发了对训练数据隐私泄漏的重大担忧，特别是在对比学习框架中。因此，有必要系统地研究成员推理攻击(MIAs)对这些模型的隐私威胁，并探索更有效的攻击方法以评估和提高模型的隐私保护能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，LpLA在多个数据集和模型架构上的攻击性能和鲁棒性均优于现有方法，特别是在有限的攻击知识和查询量的情况下。这揭示了对比学习框架中潜在的隐私泄漏风险，并为编码器模型的隐私保护研究提供了实践基础。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅揭示了对比学习框架中的隐私泄漏风险，还强调了在自监督学习模型中平衡模型效用和训练数据隐私的重要性。希望这项工作能引起更多人对自监督学习模型隐私风险的关注，并推动相关研究的发展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder
models have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a
pivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their
widespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data
privacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats
posed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing
on contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal
the significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy
leakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction
performance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,
this paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the
p-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack
(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical
distribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental
results across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA
outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly
under limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers
the potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but
also provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder
models. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks
associated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the
importance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy. Our

*Zhixiong Zhuang,Hui-Po Wang,Maria-Irina Nicolae,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Model stealing is a significant security risk in machine learning. Recent methods using pre-trained diffusion models for data synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually crafted prompts. To address this, we propose Stealix, the first approach to perform model stealing without predefined prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent methods that use pre-trained diffusion models for data synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually crafted prompts, limiting automation and scalability, especially for attackers with little expertise.

Method: Stealix uses two open-source pre-trained models to infer the victim model's data distribution, and iteratively refines prompts through a genetic algorithm, progressively improving the precision and diversity of synthetic images.

Result: Our experimental results demonstrate that Stealix significantly outperforms other methods, even those with access to class names or fine-grained prompts, while operating under the same query budget.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the scalability of our approach and suggest that the risks posed by pre-trained generative models in model stealing may be greater than previously recognized.

Abstract: Model stealing poses a significant security risk in machine learning by
enabling attackers to replicate a black-box model without access to its
training data, thus jeopardizing intellectual property and exposing sensitive
information. Recent methods that use pre-trained diffusion models for data
synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually
crafted prompts, limiting automation and scalability, especially for attackers
with little expertise. To assess the risks posed by open-source pre-trained
models, we propose a more realistic threat model that eliminates the need for
prompt design skills or knowledge of class names. In this context, we introduce
Stealix, the first approach to perform model stealing without predefined
prompts. Stealix uses two open-source pre-trained models to infer the victim

TL;DR: DPClustX是一个在满足差分隐私(DP)条件下，为黑盒聚类结果提供解释的框架。它能够处理敏感数据集和私密计算的聚类标签，并生成全局解释，突出每个聚类的主要特征。实验表明，即使在严格的隐私限制下，DPClustX也能提供有见地且准确的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护敏感数据的需求催生了多种隐私定义，其中差分隐私被认为是最严格和安全的隐私概念之一。然而，在差分隐私下解释聚类结果更具挑战性，因为查询会返回带有噪声的结果，手动探索需要额外噪声以满足隐私约束。现有的聚类解释框架可能泄露敏感信息，从而导致隐私泄露。因此，需要一种既能解释聚类结果又不泄露隐私的方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为DPClustX的框架，该框架以敏感数据集和私密计算的聚类标签作为输入，输出全局解释，强调每个聚类的主要特征，同时确保满足差分隐私条件。

Result: 通过对真实数据进行广泛的实验分析，证明了DPClustX即使在严格的隐私限制下，也能提供有见地且准确的解释。

Conclusion: DPClustX成功地在保证差分隐私的同时，为黑盒聚类结果提供了有意义的解释，解决了现有方法可能泄露敏感信息的问题。

Abstract: The dire need to protect sensitive data has led to various flavors of privacy
definitions. Among these, Differential privacy (DP) is considered one of the
most rigorous and secure notions of privacy, enabling data analysis while
preserving the privacy of data contributors. One of the fundamental tasks of
data analysis is clustering , which is meant to unravel hidden patterns within
complex datasets. However, interpreting clustering results poses significant
challenges, and often necessitates an extensive analytical process.
Interpreting clustering results under DP is even more challenging, as analysts
are provided with noisy responses to queries, and longer, manual exploration
sessions require additional noise to meet privacy constraints. While increasing
attention has been given to clustering explanation frameworks that aim at
assisting analysts by automatically uncovering the characteristics of each
cluster, such frameworks may also disclose sensitive information within the
dataset, leading to a breach in privacy. To address these challenges, we
present DPClustX, a framework that provides explanations for black-box
clustering results while satisfying DP. DPClustX takes as input the sensitive
dataset alongside privately computed clustering labels, and outputs a global
explanation, emphasizing prominent characteristics of each cluster while
guaranteeing DP. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of DPClustX on
real data, showing that it provides insightful and accurate explanations even
under tight privacy constraints.

### [183] [Combating Reentrancy Bugs on Sharded Blockchains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05932)
*Roman Kashitsyn,Robin Künzler,Ognjen Marić,Lara Schmid*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Reentrancy bugs are a known issue in Ethereum smart contracts, but less is understood about them in other blockchains. This paper examines reentrancy vulnerabilities in sharded blockchains like ICP, NEAR Protocol, and MultiversX, which use an asynchronous messaging model. The study finds that this model can increase the likelihood of reentrancy bugs. For instance, 66% of pre-production ICP smart contracts contained such bugs. The paper evaluates existing Ethereum techniques for preventing these bugs, identifies their limitations in the new model, and proposes new Rust and Motoko patterns to address these issues on ICP. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of TLA+ for formal verification to eliminate reentrancy bugs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of reentrancy bugs in sharded blockchains with asynchronous messaging models, as opposed to Ethereum's synchronous model.

Method: Study the features of the asynchronous messaging model used in sharded blockchains like ICP, NEAR Protocol, and MultiversX. Evaluate existing Ethereum programming techniques to prevent reentrancy bugs in this context, identify issues, and propose novel Rust and Motoko patterns as solutions. Use TLA+ for formal verification.

Result: Found that the asynchronous messaging model increases the risk of reentrancy bugs, with 66% of reviewed ICP smart contracts containing such bugs. Identified limitations in existing Ethereum techniques and proposed effective solutions using Rust and Motoko patterns. Demonstrated the utility of TLA+ in finding and eliminating these bugs.

Conclusion: The asynchronous messaging model in sharded blockchains makes reentrancy bugs more likely. Existing Ethereum techniques have limitations in this context, but new Rust and Motoko patterns, along with TLA+ formal verification, can effectively address these vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Reentrancy is a well-known source of smart contract bugs on Ethereum, leading
e.g. to double-spending vulnerabilities in DeFi applications. But less is known
about this problem in other blockchains, which can have significantly different
execution models. Sharded blockchains in particular generally use an
asynchronous messaging model that differs substantially from the synchronous
and transactional model of Ethereum. We study the features of this model and
its effect on reentrancy bugs on three examples: the Internet Computer (ICP)
blockchain, NEAR Protocol, and MultiversX. We argue that this model, while
useful for improving performance, also makes it easier to introduce reentrancy
bugs. For example, reviews of the pre-production versions of some of the most
critical ICP smart contracts found that 66% (10/15) of the reviewed contracts
-- written by expert authors -- contained reentrancy bugs of medium or high
severity, with potential damages in tens of millions of dollars. We evaluate
existing Ethereum programming techniques (in particular the
effects-checks-interactions pattern, and locking) to prevent reentrancy bugs in
the context of this new messaging model and identify some issues with them. We
then present novel Rust and Motoko patterns that can be leveraged on ICP to
solve these issues. Finally, we demonstrate that the formal verification tool
TLA+ can be used to find and eliminate such bugs in real world smart contracts
on sharded blockchains.

TL;DR: 随着卫星系统越来越容易受到SDR的物理层攻击，新的对策正在开发中以保护关键系统。本文研究了针对指纹系统的攻击，并展示了在SatIQ系统上的攻击效果。同时，提出了一种数据投毒攻击，通过改变用于验证传入消息的数据，实现持续的消息伪造。最后，我们展示了一个训练模型，可以优化欺骗攻击，也可以从未见过的攻击者发射器检测欺骗和重放攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于卫星系统缺乏加密保护或无法升级以支持现代加密技术，因此需要新的方法来保护这些系统。发射器指纹识别提供了一种通过查看发射器特征对通信进行身份验证的方法。

Method: 研究了针对指纹系统的攻击，包括干扰、欺骗和数据集投毒攻击，并在SatIQ系统上进行了演示。还提出了一种数据投毒攻击，通过改变用于验证传入消息的数据，实现持续的消息伪造。

Result: 优化后的干扰信号可以在低至-30dB的攻击者到受害者的比率下导致50%的错误率；在欺骗攻击中，攻击者成功地从消息中删除了自己的发射器的指纹；并且提出的数据投毒攻击能够实现持续的消息伪造。此外，训练模型不仅可以优化欺骗攻击，还可以检测欺骗和重放攻击。

Conclusion: 即使训练数据集仅包含单个发射器，该技术也可以使用指纹识别来保护小型星座甚至单个卫星，为最需要保护的地方提供了额外的保护。

Abstract: As satellite systems become increasingly vulnerable to physical layer attacks
via SDRs, novel countermeasures are being developed to protect critical
systems, particularly those lacking cryptographic protection, or those which
cannot be upgraded to support modern cryptography. Among these is transmitter
fingerprinting, which provides mechanisms by which communication can be
authenticated by looking at characteristics of the transmitter, expressed as
impairments on the signal.
  Previous works show that fingerprinting can be used to classify satellite
transmitters, or authenticate them against SDR-equipped attackers under simple
replay scenarios. In this paper we build upon this by looking at attacks
directly targeting the fingerprinting system, with an attacker optimizing for
maximum impact in jamming, spoofing, and dataset poisoning attacks, and
demonstrate these attacks on the SatIQ system designed to authenticate Iridium
transmitters. We show that an optimized jamming signal can cause a 50% error
rate with attacker-to-victim ratios as low as -30dB (far less power than
traditional jamming) and demonstrate successful identity forgery during
spoofing attacks, with an attacker successfully removing their own
transmitter's fingerprint from messages. We also present a data poisoning
attack, enabling persistent message spoofing by altering the data used to
authenticate incoming messages to include the fingerprint of the attacker's
transmitter.
  Finally, we show that our model trained to optimize spoofing attacks can also
be used to detect spoofing and replay attacks, even when it has never seen the
attacker's transmitter before. Furthermore, this technique works even when the
training dataset includes only a single transmitter, enabling fingerprinting to
be used to protect small constellations and even individual satellites,
providing additional protection where it is needed the most.

Motivation: 当前数据共享中存在隐私泄露的风险，需要一种能够在保障数据效用的同时减少信息泄露的技术方案。

Method: 引入PrivTru作为数据托管的实现方式，根据给定查询计算从数据源请求的最少信息量，以减少信息泄露。

Conclusion: PrivTru是一种遵循隐私设计原则的数据托管实例，可以有效减少信息泄露并保持数据效用。

Abstract: Data trustees serve as intermediaries that facilitate secure data sharing
between independent parties. This paper offers a technical perspective on Data
trustees, guided by privacy-by-design principles. We introduce PrivTru, an
instantiation of a data trustee that provably achieves optimal privacy
properties. Therefore, PrivTru calculates the minimal amount of information the
data trustee needs to request from data sources to respond to a given query.
Our analysis shows that PrivTru minimizes information leakage to the data
trustee, regardless of the trustee's prior knowledge, while preserving the
utility of the data.

### [186] [Joint-GCG: Unified Gradient-Based Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06151)
*Haowei Wang,Rupeng Zhang,Junjie Wang,Mingyang Li,Yuekai Huang,Dandan Wang,Qing Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Joint-GCG, a framework that unifies gradient-based attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems across both retriever and generator models. It presents three innovations and achieves higher attack success rates than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current poisoning attack strategies for RAG systems treat the retrieval and generation stages separately, which limits their effectiveness. There is a need to unify these stages for more potent attacks.

Method: Joint-GCG incorporates three key innovations: Cross-Vocabulary Projection aligns embedding spaces between retriever and generator; Gradient Tokenization Alignment synchronizes token-level gradient signals; Adaptive Weighted Fusion dynamically balances attacking objectives.

Result: Evaluations show that Joint-GCG achieves up to 25% higher and an average of 5% higher attack success rate compared to prior methods across multiple models. The poisons generated are highly transferable to unseen models under a white-box assumption.

Conclusion: Joint-GCG fundamentally changes how vulnerabilities in RAG systems are understood by successfully unifying gradient-based attacks across both retrieval and generation stages.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external corpora before generating
responses. This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging
vast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external
knowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that
manipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing
poisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages
as disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first
framework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator
models through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning
embedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing
token-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically
balancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves
at most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous
methods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a
white-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability
to unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks
across retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding
of vulnerabilities within RAG systems. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces ORCAS, a Binary Code Similarity Analysis (BCSA) model based on Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG), which performs well even under obfuscated code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-based BCSA approaches have strong performance but suffer under code obfuscation due to unstable control flow.

Method: Developed ORCAS using DESG, an original binary code representation capturing more binaries' implicit semantics without control flow structure. It scores semantic similarity across binary functions from different obfuscation options, optimization levels, and instruction set architectures.

Result: Extensive evaluation shows ORCAS significantly outperforms eight baselines, achieving an average 12.1% PR-AUC gain when using combined three obfuscation options. Also, it improves recall by up to 43% on an original obfuscated real-world vulnerability dataset.

Conclusion: ORCAS is an effective Obfuscation-Resilient BCSA model that captures more binaries' implicit semantics and performs robustly under various conditions.

Abstract: Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) serves as a core technique for binary
analysis tasks such as vulnerability detection. While current graph-based BCSA
approaches capture substantial semantics and show strong performance, their
performance suffers under code obfuscation due to the unstable control flow. To
address this issue, we develop ORCAS, an Obfuscation-Resilient BCSA model based
on Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG). The DESG is an original binary
code representation, capturing more binaries' implicit semantics without
control flow structure, including inter-instruction relations, inter-basic
block relations, and instruction-basic block relations. ORCAS robustly scores
semantic similarity across binary functions from different obfuscation options,
optimization levels, and instruction set architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BinKit dataset shows ORCAS significantly outperforms eight baselines,
achieving an average 12.1% PR-AUC gain when using combined three obfuscation
options compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, ORCAS
improves recall by up to 43% on an original obfuscated real-world vulnerability
dataset, which we released to facilitate future research.

*Yi Huang,Wajih UI Hassan,Yao Guo,Xiangqun Chen,Ding Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents PROVSYN, a framework that synthesizes provenance graphs to address class imbalance in APT detection. It uses a three-phase pipeline and improves detection performance through data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems for intrusion detection using provenance graph analysis face limitations due to class imbalance in real-world data, affecting their effectiveness in capturing complex attack patterns.

Method: PROVSYN is an automated framework with a three-phase pipeline: heterogeneous graph structure synthesis, rule-based topological refinement, and context-aware textual attribute synthesis using LLMs. It also includes an evaluation framework with various metrics and semantic validation.

Result: PROVSYN produces high-fidelity synthetic graphs and enhances the performance of downstream APT detection models when used for training data augmentation.

Conclusion: PROVSYN effectively addresses class imbalance issues in APT detection by synthesizing realistic provenance graphs, leading to improved detection capabilities.

Abstract: Provenance graph analysis plays a vital role in intrusion detection,
particularly against Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), by exposing complex
attack patterns. While recent systems combine graph neural networks (GNNs) with
natural language processing (NLP) to capture structural and semantic features,
their effectiveness is limited by class imbalance in real-world data. To
address this, we introduce PROVSYN, an automated framework that synthesizes
provenance graphs through a three-phase pipeline: (1) heterogeneous graph
structure synthesis with structural-semantic modeling, (2) rule-based
topological refinement, and (3) context-aware textual attribute synthesis using
large language models (LLMs). PROVSYN includes a comprehensive evaluation
framework that integrates structural, textual, temporal, and embedding-based
metrics, along with a semantic validation mechanism to assess the correctness
of generated attack patterns and system behaviors. To demonstrate practical
utility, we use the synthetic graphs to augment training datasets for
downstream APT detection models. Experimental results show that PROVSYN
produces high-fidelity graphs and improves detection performance through
effective data augmentation.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种部分监督神经网络（PSNN）架构，用于解决多参数二次优化问题（mp-QP）。该方法通过直接从优化问题的数学性质中推导出大部分模型权重，从而在显著减少训练数据的情况下产生更精确的解。实验结果表明，PSNN在能源系统中的应用不仅在准确性上优于传统神经网络，而且在面对极端测试数据时表现出更强的泛化能力，同时保持快速求解速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度神经网络在解决多参数二次优化问题时，即使在大规模数据集上训练，也难以提供最优和可行的预测。因此，需要一种新的方法来提高解决方案的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出了一种部分监督神经网络（PSNN）架构，利用优化问题的数学结构直接推导出模型的大部分权重，从而减少了对大量训练数据的需求。与传统的通用神经网络相比，这种方法能够更好地捕捉问题的数学本质。

Conclusion: PSNN方法为解决多参数二次优化问题提供了一种高效且准确的新途径，尤其适合处理复杂的能源管理问题，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions are used to model
multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) in diverse engineering
applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine
property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also
exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications
to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when
trained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)
architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global
solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed
PSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the
mathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate
solutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy
management problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to
energy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of
concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of
predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN
model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for
PSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training
using far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training
distribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,
the PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a
second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of
stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for
simulations and long term planning.

*Philipp Plank,Yufei Zhang*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper proposes an efficient policy optimization framework for continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic Graphon mean field games (GMFGs), with a bilevel optimization algorithm that achieves global convergence to the Nash equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent reinforcement learning struggles with scalability in large-population dynamic games. GMFGs can approximate such games while capturing heterogeneity among players.

Method: The authors design an efficient policy parameterization where each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their private state, with shared slope functions and player-specific intercepts. A bilevel optimization algorithm alternates between policy gradient updates for best-response computation and distribution updates using the resulting policies.

Result: The policy gradient steps converge linearly to best-response policies, and the overall algorithm globally converges to the Nash equilibrium. Numerical experiments show the convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under different conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed policy optimization framework and bilevel optimization algorithm effectively solve continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs with theoretical guarantees and demonstrated robustness.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical
success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic
games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for
approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this
paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for
continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the
structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization
in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their
private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We
develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy
gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population
distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove
linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and
establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.
The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over
infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon
structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.

### [191] [Convergence of linear programming hierarchies for Gibbs states of spin systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06125)
*Hamza Fawzi,Omar Fawzi*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores two families of linear programming hierarchies for computing expectation values under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. Both hierarchies provide fast convergence under certain conditions and offer an ε-approximation using a quasi-polynomial size linear program.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop efficient methods for computing expectation values of local functions under the Gibbs distribution in spin systems, addressing limitations of standard Monte Carlo methods.

Method: Two families of linear programming hierarchies are studied: one imposing local spin flip equalities and another based on a Markov chain with the Gibbs state as a fixed point. The first hierarchy converges quickly under a spatial mixing condition, while the second requires rapid mixing of the Markov chain.

Result: Both hierarchies achieve fast convergence and provide rigorous upper and lower bounds on expectation values without prior analysis of convergence speed. An ε-approximation is obtained using a quasi-polynomial size linear program.

Conclusion: Linear programming hierarchies offer an alternative to Monte Carlo methods for computing expectation values in spin systems, providing rigorous bounds and efficient computation under specific conditions.

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions
under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two
families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first
hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the
bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast
convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This
condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising
models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov
chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the
optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this
hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.
Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation
values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be
embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard
Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for
any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of
interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.

Result: A complete and sound polynomial-time decision procedure for checking the consistency of LE-FALC ABoxes and an exponential-time decision procedure for acyclic TBoxes.

Conclusion: LE-FALC allows representation and reasoning about knowledge in fuzzy formal contexts with efficient consistency checking algorithms.

Abstract: Recently, description logic LE-ALC was introduced for reasoning in the
semantic environment of enriched formal contexts, and a polynomial-time
tableaux algorithm was developed to check the consistency of knowledge bases
with acyclic TBoxes. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy generalization of
LE-ALC called LE-FALC which provides a description logic counterpart of
many-valued normal non-distributive logic a.k.a. many-valued LE-logic. This
description logic can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in the
formal framework of fuzzy formal contexts and fuzzy formal concepts. We provide
a tableaux algorithm that provides a complete and sound polynomial-time
decision procedure to check the consistency of LE-FALC ABoxes. As a result, we
also obtain an exponential-time decision procedure for checking the consistency
of LE-FALC with acyclic TBoxes by unraveling.

Conclusion: 将神经网络转化为区域表示是一种可行的提高其可解释性的方法，但需要进一步研究以优化区域表示的复杂性和转化属性的满足程度。

Abstract: A possible path to the interpretability of neural networks is to
(approximately) represent them in the regional format of piecewise linear
functions, where regions of inputs are associated to linear functions computing
the network outputs. We present an algorithm for the translation of feedforward
neural networks with ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and truncated
identity activation functions in the output layer. We also empirically
investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.

Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While
combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed
modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of
patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are
the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different
variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations
is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure
correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local
regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract
such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations
are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in
phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation
analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be
overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These
correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to
the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector
field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently
representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our
approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and
forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of systematically revealing regularities in increasingly complex data obtained through scientific observation.

Method: An algorithm is presented which uses the Stokes parameter to fully consider the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector. This generates maps representing both the type and degree of correlations between physical quantities.

Result: This approach allows for a spatially resolved view of correlations, enabling separation of regions into subregions with different types of correlations. It identifies physical regimes or climate zones effectively.

Conclusion: The simplicity and wide applicability of the method make it a powerful tool for revealing regularities in various types of data, potentially aiding in the development of new computational approaches for regularity discovery.

Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature
for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to
discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With
increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically
has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective
approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial
inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present
an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations,
by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account
using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of
the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the
correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions
with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes
for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the
method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the
correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing
regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to
represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new
computational approaches to regularity discovery.

*Ambrose Emmett-Iwaniw,Nathan Kirk*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an efficient version of ConvNADE model for predicting unobserved parts of images given a small subset of pixels, and investigates the impact of pixel selection strategies on image reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models decompose high-dimensional density functions into one-dimensional conditionals for learning distributions of image data. The order of variable processing is crucial to model performance.

Method: A generalized, computationally efficient ConvNADE model is proposed for real-valued and color images. The study also examines image reconstruction quality using random and low-discrepancy pixel patches.

Result: Experiments show that selecting pixels based on low-discrepancy sequences leads to lower test loss and more realistic reconstructed images compared to random selection.

Conclusion: Using low-discrepancy pixel patches can improve the performance of autoregressive models in image reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

Motivation: Registration of histology and MSI is challenging due to their different image formation processes and dimensionalities, requiring a solution for precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in tissue.

Method: Proposes synthesising histological images from MSI using a pix2pix model to enable unimodal registration.

Result: Preliminary results demonstrate synthetic histology images with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and structural similarity index measures (SSIM).

Conclusion: The proposed method shows promise in synthesizing histological images from MSI for effective registration.

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for

TL;DR: The paper proposes FPDANet, a bilateral multi-scale information fusion network with DAN and FPAN modules to improve classification of fetal ultrasound images, achieving 91.05% Top-1 and 100% Top-5 accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet's unidirectional feature transfer and lack of effective context correlation is not suitable for classifying fetal ultrasound images due to their low contrast, high similarity, and high noise.

Method: Propose FPDANet which includes the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module that establishes dependencies among spatial features and the bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module that captures contextual and global feature dependencies at different scales.

Result: Achieved 91.05% accuracy in Top-1 metric and 100% in Top-5 metric for classifying fetal ultrasound images.

Conclusion: FPDANet proves to be effective and robust for classifying fetal ultrasound images.

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

TL;DR: LinGuinE is an automated method for longitudinal lung tumor segmentation which improves Dice scores by over 20% in tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation of lung gross tumor volumes is critical in radiotherapy, surgery, and assessing chemotherapy response. However, there are few solutions for automated or semi-automated longitudinal tumor segmentation.

Method: A radiologist provides an initial input indicating the tumor location in a CT scan. LinGuinE samples points inside the tumor and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration. A click validity classifier selects points still within the tumor to create a new segmentation.

Result: LinGuinE was tested on datasets from a phase 3 clinical trial and the 4-D lung CBCT dataset. It improved the Dice score by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63 longitudinal studies. Experiments showed any time point can be used as a starting point.

Conclusion: LinGuinE setup yields the best results on both test datasets for longitudinal lung tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Motivation: 尽管少数民族群体面临更高的在线风险，但针对他们的安全和隐私问题的研究很少。本研究旨在填补这一空白，探讨少数民族群体在使用在线服务时的安全和隐私相关问题、态度和行为。

Method: 研究者对英国不同少数民族背景的44人进行了半结构化访谈，涉及健康、社会住房和能源三个领域的在线服务使用情况。随后，对访谈内容进行了主题分析。

Result: 隐私问题是少数民族群体使用在线服务时的主要担忧；许多人报告了创造性策略，如选择性和不一致地披露个人信息；对数据使用的恐惧源于对报复、惩罚和歧视的担忧，这与以往的制度性和在线种族主义经历有关；信任（或缺乏信任）在调整行为方面起着基础性作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计更具包容性、边缘化意识和隐私保护的在线服务提供了经验教训，强调需要关注少数民族群体的需求和担忧。

Abstract: Minoritised ethnic people are marginalised in society, and therefore at a
higher risk of adverse online harms, including those arising from the loss of
security and privacy of personal data. Despite this, there has been very little
research focused on minoritised ethnic people's security and privacy concerns,
attitudes, and behaviours. In this work, we provide the results of one of the
first studies in this regard. We explore minoritised ethnic people's
experiences of using essential online services across three sectors: health,
social housing, and energy, their security and privacy-related concerns, and
responses towards these services. We conducted a thematic analysis of 44
semi-structured interviews with people of various reported minoritised
ethnicities in the UK. Privacy concerns and lack of control over personal data
emerged as a major theme, with many interviewees considering privacy as their
most significant concern when using online services. Several creative tactics
to exercise some agency were reported, including selective and inconsistent
disclosure of personal data. A core concern about how data may be used was
driven by a fear of repercussions, including penalisation and discrimination,
influenced by prior experiences of institutional and online racism. The
increased concern and potential for harm resulted in minoritised ethnic people
grappling with a higher-stakes dilemma of whether to disclose personal
information online or not. Furthermore, trust in institutions, or lack thereof,
was found to be embedded throughout as a basis for adapting behaviour. We draw
on our results to provide lessons learned for the design of more inclusive,
marginalisation-aware, and privacy-preserving online services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具越来越多地融入高等教育，了解学生如何与这些技术互动和感知是负责任和有效采用的关键。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合前后调查、系统使用日志以及对学生向AI聊天机器人提出的开放式问题和提示的定性分析。

Result: 发现学生们欣赏AI助手的便利和舒适性，近一半的学生报告说使用AI工具比向讲师或助教求助更容易。该工具被认为最有助于完成作业和理解课程概念，尽管对其教学质量的看法不一。伦理问题是全面参与的主要障碍，许多学生对机构政策不确定并担心潜在的学术不当行为。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了可用性、政策清晰度和教师指导在促进有意义的AI参与中的重要性，表明学生愿意接受AI作为人类教学的补充，但需要深思熟虑的整合和透明的制度框架来确保学生的信心、信任和学习效果。

Abstract: As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into higher education,
understanding how students interact with and perceive these technologies is
essential for responsible and effective adoption. This study evaluates the use
of the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, in undergraduate
civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university.
Using a mixed-methods approach that combines pre- and post-surveys, system
usage logs, and qualitative analysis of the open-ended prompts and questions
students posed to the AI chatbot, the research explores students' perceptions
of trust, ethical concerns, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal
that students appreciated the AI assistant for its convenience and comfort,
with nearly half reporting greater ease in using the AI tool compared to
seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was seen as most
helpful for completing homework and understanding course concepts, though
perceptions of its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical concerns emerged
as a key barrier to full engagement: while most students viewed AI use as
ethically acceptable, many expressed uncertainties about institutional policies
and apprehension about potential academic misconduct. This study contributes to
the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance
of usability, policy clarity, and faculty guidance in fostering meaningful AI
engagement. The findings suggest that while students are ready to embrace AI as
a supplement to human instruction, thoughtful integration and transparent
institutional frameworks are critical for ensuring student confidence, trust,
and learning effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper presents an open-source framework using small locally deployed LLMs for generating customized teaching materials and assessments, incorporating interactive refinement loops, auxiliary verifiers, and RAG/CAG techniques to ensure safety, accuracy, and pedagogical quality. The system is cost-effective, deployable on-premises, and performs comparably to larger models in targeted tasks.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as
student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators,
particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions,
remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely
on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may
raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require
affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source
framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for
customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely
incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement,
and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output
reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation
(RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled
content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an
evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that
carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical,
and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for
targeted tasks.

*Zackary Okun Dunivin,Paul E. Smaldino*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the drawbacks of current scientific recommender systems which overly rely on popularity, leading to intellectual homogeneity and structural inequities. It suggests reforming search platforms by incorporating user-specific calibration and utilizing word embeddings and LLMs to enhance user autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scientific recommender systems overly depend on popularity, resulting in a lack of diversity in perspectives and exacerbating structural inequities in scientific progress.

Method: Propose an overhaul of search platforms including user-specific calibration for adjusting factors like popularity, recency, and relevance, and suggest implementing word embeddings and LLMs to increase user control.

Result: The proposed changes aim to foster more innovative and diverse perspectives in science by enhancing user autonomy in information access systems.

Conclusion: Designing platforms that increase user autonomy is crucial for creating more robust and dynamic information systems applicable beyond scientific contexts.

Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science,
are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through
stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths
through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this
``rich-get-richer'' dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers
that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm
over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates
structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical
for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to
incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust
the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise
platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in
ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly
pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas
are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing
platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust
and dynamic information

*Luca Nepote,Alix Lhéritier,Nicolas Bondoux,Marios Kountouris,Maurizio Filippone*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs) with single-bit weights reduce memory and power needs. Training them is challenging, but Quantum HyperNetworks using quantum computing can help optimize BiNNs. This work connects this approach to Bayesian inference and shows better trainability and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training algorithms for Binary Neural Networks are insufficient, prompting the need for more effective optimization methods.

Method: Quantum HyperNetworks use a Variational Quantum Algorithm to generate binary weights via quantum circuit measurements, employing quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to explore larger solution spaces. Connections to Bayesian inference are established through ELBO and surrogate ELBO based on MMD metric.

Result: The proposed methods surpass standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation in terms of trainability and generalization.

Conclusion: Quantum HyperNetworks provide an innovative way to optimize Binary Neural Networks, enhancing their performance and applicability.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights,
have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power
consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems.
However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations
of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel
paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum
computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to
generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum
phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of
a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this
approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO),
when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in
simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as
commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE),
improving trainability and generalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents R2AG, a reinforced retriever for generating long-form discharge instructions using pre-admission data. It uses reinforcement learning and Group-Based Retriever Optimization (GRO) to improve retrieval quality and bridge information gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language model-based methods struggle with producing long-form clinical notes from limited patient information.

Method: R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing semantic guidance to the LLM. GRO improves retrieval quality by encouraging deeper inference through group-relative rewards.

Result: Experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG outperforms baselines in clinical efficacy and natural language generation metrics. It fills semantic gaps in sparse input scenarios and helps LLMs avoid clinical misinterpretation.

Conclusion: R2AG demonstrates superior performance in generating long-form discharge instructions, enhancing both clinical efficacy and natural language generation.

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)

benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: To address the limitation of most prior personalized reward models which heavily depend on additional identity information like demographic details or predefined preference categories, there's a need for an approach that can adapt models to diverse user preferences without such reliance.

Method: SynthesizeMe generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, induces synthetic user personas from this reasoning, and filters informative prior user interactions to build personalized prompts for a particular user.

Result: Using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on PersonalRewardBench, a new dataset of user-stratified interactions with chatbots.

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe offers an effective way to induce synthetic user personas from user interactions, improving personalized reward modeling without relying on additional identity information.

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on

### [214] [Large Language Models are Good Relational Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05725)
*Fang Wu,Vijay Prakash Dwivedi,Jure Leskovec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with relational deep learning (RDL) due to disregarding relational structures, redundancy, and context length limitations. Rel-LLM is introduced, utilizing a graph neural network (GNN)-based encoder within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to preserve relational structures and enable LLMs to process complex entity relationships effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into flat text documents, which disregard critical relational structures, introduce redundancy, and often exceed standard LLM context lengths.

Method: Rel-LLM uses a GNN-based encoder to generate structured relational prompts for LLMs within a RAG framework. The GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature representations containing relevant entity relationships and temporal dependencies, then transforms these into structured prompts via a denormalization process.

Result: Through extensive experiments, Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, providing a scalable and efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources.

Conclusion: Rel-LLM offers a novel architecture that enables LLMs to effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships while preserving the inherent relational structure of databases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and
efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources. Code is

Method: Fine-tune multilingual LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of GSM8K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in Chinese, Korean, and Ukrainian. Monitor task accuracy and language consistency of reasoning chains during training.

Result: Key findings include: rapid amplification of pre-training language imbalances leading to erosion of low-resource languages; language consistency reward mitigates drift but reduces accuracy; resulting language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible.

Conclusion: Not all languages are trained equally for reasoning, highlighting the roles of reward shaping, data difficulty, and pre-training priors in multilingual reasoning.

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

*Chenyang Shao,Xinyang Liu,Yutang Lin,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出R2-Reasoner框架，通过动态路由子任务至不同规模模型实现协同推理，显著降低成本并保持或超越基准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步推理对提升大语言模型问题解决能力至关重要，但扩展推理链增加了成本，而许多推理步骤可由更小、更高效的模型处理，因此需要混合方法进行任务分解和难度感知的子任务分配。

Method: 核心是强化模型路由器，包含任务分解器和子任务分配器，将复杂查询分解为逻辑有序子任务，并分配给最合适的模型；使用分阶段管道训练路由器，结合监督微调与组相对策略优化算法。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准测试中，R2-Reasoner减少了86.85%的API成本，同时保持或超越了基线准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为更经济高效和自适应的大语言模型推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

### [219] [MoA: Heterogeneous Mixture of Adapters for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05928)
*Jie Cao,Tianwei Lin,Hongyang He,Rolan Yan,Wenqiao Zhang,Juncheng Li,Dongping Zhang,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent studies integrate LoRA and MoE to enhance PEFT methods in LLM applications. However, homogeneous MoE-LoRA architectures suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance. To address this, a heterogeneous Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA) approach is proposed, which integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse structures to foster expert specialization and enhance knowledge transfer to downstream tasks. MoA has two variants: Soft MoA and Sparse MoA. Experimental results show that heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance and parameter efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of homogeneous MoE-LoRA architectures, such as representation collapse and expert load imbalance, which negatively impact the potential of LLMs.

Method: Propose a heterogeneous Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA) approach that dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse structures. This leverages their complementary representational capabilities to foster expert specialization and enhance the effective transfer of pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants: Soft MoA and Sparse MoA.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance and parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous MoA is an effective solution to the limitations of homogeneous MoE-LoRA architectures, enhancing the potential of LLMs.

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

*Wei Li,Yanbin Wei,Qiushi Huang,Jiangyue Yan,Yang Chen,James T. Kwok,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Modern large language models (LLMs) have difficulty adapting reasoning depth to task complexities. DynamicMind, a novel tri-mode thinking system, addresses this by allowing LLMs to select Fast, Normal, or Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question answering tasks. It expands the dual-process framework, proposes a Thinking Density metric, and develops a TMC dataset and Mind Router. Experiments show it improves ZSQA capabilities and balances performance with efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to adjust reasoning depth according to task complexities, resulting in suboptimal performance or inefficient resource use.

Method: DynamicMind introduces a tri-mode thinking system (Fast, Normal, Slow) for LLMs using cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. It expands the dual-process framework, proposes the Thinking Density metric, and develops the Thinking Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a Mind Router.

Result: Experiments across various QA benchmarks demonstrate superior zero-shot question answering capabilities and an effective balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: DynamicMind successfully enhances LLMs' ability to adapt reasoning depth to task complexities, improving zero-shot question answering while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their
reasoning depth to varying task complexities, leading to suboptimal performance
or inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we introduce DynamicMind,
a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question
answering (ZSQA) tasks through cognitive-inspired prompt engineering. Our
framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,
commonsense, and scientific QA benchmarks demonstrate that DynamicMind achieves
superior ZSQA capabilities while establishing an effective trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency.

### [221] [IntentionESC: An Intention-Centered Framework for Enhancing Emotional Support in Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05947)
*Xinjie Zhang,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In this paper, researchers propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation (IntentionESC) framework and the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT) mechanism to improve the quality of emotional support conversations by defining supporter intentions, analyzing emotional states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research is the issue of unclear intentions in emotional support conversations leading to inappropriate strategies by supporters, which can inadvertently impose their expectations or solutions on the seeker. Thus, clearly defined intentions are crucial for guiding both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process.

Method: The proposed method includes two key components: the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation (IntentionESC) framework and the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT) mechanism. The IntentionESC framework defines possible intentions of supporters in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies. ICECoT enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies. Additionally, an automated annotation pipeline is designed to train the model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge.

Result: The comprehensive evaluation scheme developed for assessing emotional support efficacy shows positive results through extensive experiments validating the proposed framework.

Conclusion: This work concludes that the IntentionESC framework combined with the ICECoT mechanism significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to generate more effective emotional support responses, thereby improving the overall quality of emotional support conversations.

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

*Markelle Kelly,Mohammad Tahaei,Padhraic Smyth,Lauren Wilcox*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores gender bias in e-commerce product descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs), identifying unique forms of bias and proposing specialized detection and mitigation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite extensive research on gender bias in LLMs across many domains, the application of these models in e-commerce has not been thoroughly examined. This creates a need to investigate potential algorithmic biases specific to this context.

Method: The authors develop data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias for product description generation within e-commerce, linking them to existing general-purpose harms taxonomies. They quantitatively analyze two models (GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM) to demonstrate how these biases manifest.

Result: The study reveals several under-explored dimensions of gender bias in e-commerce, including assumptions about clothing size, stereotypical advertising features, and differences in persuasive language usage. These biases correspond to exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities as defined by current AI harm frameworks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity for specialized approaches to detect and mitigate gender biases in LLM-generated product descriptions in e-commerce, contributing to a broader understanding of AI-related harms in this domain.

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理和其他应用中推动了重大进展。然而，将LLMs应用于动态图（现实世界演化网络）的研究较少。本文提出了Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker)，一个为LLMs设计的新的时间图学习框架。TGTalker利用时间图中的最近性偏差提取相关结构信息，并将其转换为自然语言供LLMs使用，同时利用时间邻居作为预测的附加信息。TGTalker在链接预测能力上与现有的时间图神经网络（TGNN）模型具有竞争力，并在五个真实世界网络中表现良好，同时在可解释性和可理解性方面开辟了新的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量文献探讨了LLMs的图推理能力及其在图上的预测器使用，但将LLMs应用于动态图（现实世界演化的网络）仍然是相对未开发的领域。此外，现有研究主要集中在由随机图模型生成的合成时间图上，而将LLMs应用于真实世界的时间图仍是一个开放的问题。

Method: TGTalker利用时间图中的最近性偏差来提取相关的结构信息，并将其转换为自然语言以供LLMs使用。同时，它利用时间邻居作为额外的信息进行预测。这种方法使得TGTalker能够在不依赖复杂的神经网络架构的情况下，实现对时间图的有效学习和预测。

Result: TGTalker在链接预测任务上表现出色，与现有的时间图神经网络（TGNN）模型相比具有竞争力。在五个真实世界网络上的实验表明，TGTalker不仅能够与最先进的方法相媲美，而且还能持续超越一些流行模型如TGN和HTGN。此外，TGTalker还为每个预测生成文本解释，增强了模型的可解释性和可理解性。

Conclusion: TGTalker作为一个新型的时间图学习框架，成功地将LLMs应用于时间图分析。该框架通过利用时间图中的最近性偏差和时间邻居信息，实现了有效的链接预测，并且在多个真实世界网络上表现出了竞争力。此外，TGTalker生成的文本解释为时间链接预测的可解释性和可理解性提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recent studies indicate that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models (LLMs) has not yet reached human-level performance. Fine-tuning LLMs on ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, so inference-time methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. This study introduces a new inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from contexts involving changes in the world state, but there is a need for a more generalized approach that can handle broader scenarios.

Method: The new method, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, involves specifying the beginning of LLM outputs with 'Let's put ourselves in A's shoes.', where A denotes the target character's name.

Result: SoO prefixing consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states when evaluated on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and narrative contexts without changes in the world state.

Conclusion: SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the ToM performance.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

*Peijie Liu,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhances LLMs' complex reasoning tasks. This paper observes that token probability monotonicity correlates with CoT gains and proposes two indicators to assess CoT effectiveness. By combining these indicators with logistic regression, the authors introduce Dynamic CoT which selects between CoT and direct answers dynamically. They also extend this method to closed-source models through strategy transfer from open-source ones. The indicators achieve 89.2% accuracy in assessing CoT effectiveness, while Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by over 35% without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to explore why Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has inconsistent performance improvements across different tasks and to develop a way to assess its effectiveness. This exploration aims at improving the efficiency of CoT usage in large language models.

Method: The authors first observe a potential correlation between the monotonicity of token probability distributions and CoT performance gains. Based on this observation, they propose two indicators derived from token probability distribution to evaluate CoT effectiveness. They then integrate instance-level indicators with a logistic regression model to create Dynamic CoT, a method that can dynamically choose between using CoT or providing a direct answer. Finally, they extend the application of Dynamic CoT to closed-source models via transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models.

Result: The proposed indicators for evaluating CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2%. Additionally, Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35% while preserving high accuracy.

Conclusion: This work provides a new perspective on the underlying mechanisms of CoT reasoning and offers a framework for deploying CoT more efficiently. It not only helps understand why CoT performs differently across tasks but also suggests ways to optimize its use in both open-source and closed-source models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

*Haoke Zhang,Xiaobo Liang,Cunxiang Wang,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AvR (Alignment via Refinement), a method that enhances LLMs' recursive reasoning through long-form Chain of Thought by introducing a refinement process guided by differentiable learning techniques. This significantly outperforms conventional methods, especially with synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of LLMs in recursive thinking, particularly when there's a lack of expert-curated data for distillation.

Method: AvR introduces a refinement process integrating criticism and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to optimize refinement-aware rewards.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that AvR surpasses conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, it improves the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct model's performance by over 20% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 using only 3k synthetic samples.

Conclusion: AvR effectively unlocks the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through long-form CoT, showing significant improvements with limited synthetic data.

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型中参数知识和上下文输入之间的冲突问题，减少事实不一致性和幻觉现象。

Method: 提出Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability（SR-DCR）框架，融合token级别自信心和不对称多代理辩论机制，并由裁判模型评估辩论以确定上下文可靠性。最终答案通过结合判决与模型信心得出。

Result: 在ClashEval基准测试上的实验表明，SR-DCR能够持续增强对误导性上下文的鲁棒性，同时保持对可靠输入的准确性，且计算开销小。

Conclusion: SR-DCR框架有效地解决了大型语言模型中的知识与上下文冲突问题，优于传统辩论和仅基于信心的方法。

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at
https://github.com/smiles724/Self-Reflective-Debates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed Natural Language Processing, but their reliance on large-scale datasets can lead to copyright infringement. Current dataset-inference methods depend on log probabilities, which are being withheld by leading LLMs. This paper introduces CatShift, a label-only framework that uses catastrophic forgetting to identify unauthorized data usage in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting whether an LLM has been trained on copyrighted or proprietary data without relying on internal model logits, which are increasingly being withheld or obfuscated.

Method: CatShift capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting by fine-tuning the LLM on a suspicious dataset and observing the shift in model outputs. If the model was previously exposed to the suspicious data, fine-tuning triggers a significant shift; novel data results in more modest changes. By comparing these shifts against a known non-member validation set, the method statistically determines dataset membership.

Result: Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs demonstrate CatShift's effectiveness in identifying dataset membership even when log probabilities are inaccessible.

Conclusion: CatShift offers a robust and practical solution for protecting proprietary datasets from unauthorized use in LLM training.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

*Yingqi Hu,Zhuo Zhang,Jingyuan Zhang,Lizhen Qu,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在联邦微调大语言模型（FedLLMs）中，尽管能保护数据隐私，但其固有的记忆能力使其容易受到训练数据提取攻击。本文提出针对FedLLMs设计的简单而有效的提取攻击算法，并引入了两个评估指标和一个真实世界的法律数据集扩展版本。实验表明，该方法可提取高达56.57%的独特PII，强调了对稳健防御策略的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FedLLMs能够在保护数据隐私的同时实现强大的模型性能，但由于LLMs的记忆能力，它们容易受到训练数据提取攻击。为了研究这一风险，需要设计专门针对FedLLMs的提取攻击算法。

Method: 提出针对FedLLMs的提取攻击算法，在更现实的威胁模型下操作，仅使用单个客户端的数据来提取其他客户端中未见过的PII。利用攻击者持有的上下文前缀进行跨客户端泛化。同时，提出了覆盖范围和效率两个严格指标，并扩展了一个带有PII注释的真实世界法律数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法能够提取高达56.57%的独特PII，其中“地址”、“生日”和“姓名”是最易受攻击的类别。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了对稳健防御策略的迫切需求，并为未来的隐私保护联邦学习研究提供了一个新的基准和评估框架。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

### [230] [Multidimensional Analysis of Specific Language Impairment Using Unsupervised Learning Through PCA and Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05498)
*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze linguistic features in children with and without Specific Language Impairment (SLI), revealing two primary clusters and challenging categorical diagnostic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional diagnostic approaches for SLI may overlook subtle developmental patterns, so this study aims to identify natural language development trajectories using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

Method: Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years across three corpora were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering based on 64 linguistic features.

Result: Two primary clusters emerged: high language production with low SLI prevalence, and limited production but higher syntactic complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Boundary cases exhibited intermediate traits supporting a continuum model of language abilities.

Conclusion: SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity rather than syntactic complexity deficits, and unsupervised learning techniques have potential for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

*Christophe Van Gysel,Maggie Wu,Lyan Verwimp,Caglar Tirkaz,Marco Bertola,Zhihong Lei,Youssef Oualil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A phonetic correction system is proposed to improve word error rate in end-to-end ASR models for voice search applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end ASR models may suffer poor recognition for recent or infrequent movie titles due to insufficient representation in training data.

Method: The system consists of a phonetic search that generates alternatives and a rescorer that combines ASR model recognition and the alternatives.

Result: The approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6% relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles.

Conclusion: The phonetic correction system can effectively enhance the performance of E2E ASR models in recognizing less represented terms.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents semantic-features, a library for studying contextualized word embeddings by projecting them into interpretable spaces. Through an experiment involving dative constructions, it demonstrates the tool's ability to reveal sensitivities in masked language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To introduce and validate a new library called semantic-features that allows for the study of contextualized word embeddings by projecting them into interpretable spaces.

Method: Developed a dataset of 450 sentence pairs using dative constructions (prepositional or double object) where recipients are ambiguous between person-hood and place-hood. Applied the semantic-features library to measure the contextual effect on semantic interpretation.

Result: The contextualized word embeddings from three masked language models showed expected sensitivities when using the semantic-features library.

Conclusion: The authors are optimistic about the usefulness of their semantic-features tool for analyzing contextualized word embeddings.

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

TL;DR: This paper introduces PuzzleWorld, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating open-ended and creative multimodal reasoning through puzzlehunt-style problems. It highlights current model limitations in this domain and provides insights for future advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the capabilities of foundation models in solving complex, multi-step puzzles with unclear problem definitions, mirroring real-world exploratory and investigative tasks.

Method: Introduced PuzzleWorld, a benchmark containing 667 puzzlehunt-style problems, annotated with solutions, reasoning traces, and cognitive skill labels. Evaluated state-of-the-art models on these puzzles and conducted error analysis to identify limitations.

Result: State-of-the-art models achieved only 1-2% final answer accuracy, with the best model solving 14% of puzzles. Fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improved stepwise reasoning from 4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone led to near zero performance.

Conclusion: Current models struggle with open-ended reasoning due to myopic reasoning, language-based inference limitations, and lack of sketching capabilities. PuzzleWorld is released to support research in building more general reasoning systems.

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

-- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps
in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We
envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data,
propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision
requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and
developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts
between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in
physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已知语言模型可以逐字记忆训练数据中的长序列，但它们对训练中看到的事实的记忆方式却鲜为人知。因此，需要一个专门的数据集来研究事实记忆和逐字记忆的双重过程。

Method: 提出一个新的数据集，该数据集由合成生成的类似webtext的文档和关于虚构事件的问题-答案对组成。通过使用这些合成数据进行训练实验，以区分不同的记忆形式。同时记录构建现实的、虚构的合成数据的挑战。

Result: 实验表明，关于虚构事件的合成数据在区分不同形式的记忆方面是有效的，并且记录了构建此类数据的挑战。

Conclusion: 这个新数据集为研究语言模型的记忆过程提供了工具，并揭示了构建有效合成数据的困难。

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

### [237] [Being Strong Progressively! Enhancing Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models through a Curriculum Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05695)
*Lingyuan Liu,Mengxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new curriculum learning framework, POCL, inspired by 'progressive overload' is proposed to enhance stability and efficiency in Knowledge Distillation (KD) for large language models. It ranks training samples by difficulty and gradually introduces harder samples during distillation, improving student model performance across various KD methods and model families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods for large language models often fail to prevent significant shifts in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch.

Method: The proposed method is a plug-in curriculum learning framework called POCL, which includes a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training samples from easy to hard, and a training scheduler that incrementally introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures.

Result: Extensive experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across various white-box KD methods and model families.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs and demonstrate how structuring training data within the KD process can enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) that uses knowledge graphs and confidence scores to capture implicit knowledge structures, along with an inference-based protocol using LLMs as judges to assess unlearning success. Experiments show current strategies overestimate unlearning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine unlearning techniques for LLMs mainly focus on explicit removal of isolated facts but neglect latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge, causing implicitly persisted facts through correlated information.

Method: The method involves creating a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework representing factual contexts as knowledge graphs with confidence scores. It also develops an inference-based evaluation protocol using powerful LLMs as judges who reason over extracted knowledge subgraphs and are calibrated against human evaluations.

Result: Experiments on a newly constructed benchmark indicate that the proposed framework offers a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance, revealing that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their framework provides a better evaluation of unlearning in LLMs and highlights the need for improved strategies in assessing unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型使用上下文化学习（ICL）处理大型文本语料库的查询，但这种方法内存消耗大、成本高，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的方法，即离线训练一个小型的KV缓存（称为Cartridge）。通过生成关于语料库的合成对话，并以上下文蒸馏目标训练Cartridge，这种方法被称为自学习。

Result: 使用自学习方法训练的Cartridge在具有挑战性的长上下文基准测试中匹配了ICL的性能，同时使用的内存减少了38.6倍，吞吐量提高了26.4倍。此外，该方法还扩展了模型的有效上下文长度，并允许在推理时无需重新训练即可组合Cartridge。

Conclusion: 自学习方法提供了一种更高效的替代方案，可以在保持ICL功能的同时显著降低服务成本和内存消耗。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents ATC, a novel zero-shot method for detecting LLM-generated code by conditioning on approximated tasks, achieving SOTA results and generalizing across programming languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting LLM-generated code is crucial for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity. Current methods lack effectiveness when only considering the code without its generating task prompt.

Method: ATC approximates the original task that generated a code snippet and evaluates token-level entropy under this task conditioning. It leverages differences in conditional probability distributions between LLM-generated and human-written code given the task prompt.

Result: ATC achieves state-of-the-art results in detecting LLM-generated code across various benchmarks and programming languages (Python, CPP, Java). It outperforms unconditional detection methods.

Conclusion: Task-level conditioning is essential for effective LLM-generated code detection. The proposed ATC method provides a practical solution requiring no access to the generator LLM or original task prompts.

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors address the challenge of personalized financial product recommendations by proposing a hybrid framework that combines large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). This approach enhances the ability to capture user preferences and complex relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation methods such as collaborative filtering or content-based models are insufficient in capturing users' latent preferences and complex interactions. With the growth of fintech, there is a need for more advanced and personalized recommendation systems.

Method: The authors introduce a hybrid framework that integrates pre-trained LLMs for encoding text data with GNNs for modeling user-product interactions via a heterogeneous graph. The message-passing mechanism within the GNN fuses text and graph information to optimize embeddings jointly.

Result: Experiments conducted on both public and real-world financial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses standalone LLM or GNN models in terms of accuracy, recall, and NDCG. Additionally, the model maintains strong interpretability.

Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into improving personalized financial recommendations through the combination of LLMs and GNNs. It also highlights the potential of cross-modal fusion techniques in broader recommendation tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of fintech, personalized financial product
recommendations have become increasingly important. Traditional methods like
collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users'
latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework
integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A
pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature
vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and
social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph
information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings.
Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model
outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong
interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial
recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of temporal item sequence embeddings with higher-order user embeddings in graph-based recommendation systems, showing that incorporating sequence information improves recommendation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based recommendation systems already employ higher-order user and item embeddings for next-item predictions. However, while item-item correlations have been studied, the efficacy of temporal item sequences has not been extensively explored.

Method: The authors examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware) embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings using sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). They compare Heterogeneous Sequel-aware GNNs (HSAL-GNNs) against other sequential learning algorithms such as transformers, standard GNNs, and auto-encoders on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Empirical results indicate that incorporating sequence information from items significantly enhances recommendation performance, with HSAL-GNNs performing better or comparably to other methods without considering sequel information.

Conclusion: Sequel-aware embeddings in graph-based recommendation systems improve recommendation performance by leveraging temporal item sequences.

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems use higher-order user and item embeddings
for next-item predictions. Dynamically adding collaborative signals from
neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While
item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied,
the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less
explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware)
embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance
than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel
information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning
(such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on
three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the
incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances
recommendations.

*Julien Soulé,Jean-Paul Jamont,Michel Occello,Louis-Marie Traonouez,Paul Théron*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: An original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering Approach (AOMEA) is introduced, which combines Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) with an organizational model to facilitate the design of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of designing MAS in high complexity and low readability deployment environments where current methods are costly or raise safety concerns.

Method: Introduction of AOMEA that integrates MARL process with an organizational model to suggest relevant organizational specifications for MAS engineering.

Result: The approach aims to ease the design of MAS organization by providing assistance through learning and modeling.

Conclusion: AOMEA has the potential to improve the efficiency and safety of MAS design in complex environments.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in industry for
their ability to address complex, distributed problems, especially in IoT-based
systems. Their efficiency in achieving given objectives and meeting design
requirements is strongly dependent on the MAS organization during the
engineering process of an application-specific MAS. To design a MAS that can
achieve given goals, available methods rely on the designer's knowledge of the
deployment environment. However, high complexity and low readability in some
deployment environments make the application of these methods to be costly or
raise safety concerns. In order to ease the MAS organization design regarding
those concerns, we introduce an original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering
Approach (AOMEA). AOMEA relies on combining a Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) process with an organizational model to suggest relevant
organizational specifications to help in MAS engineering.

*Tianyi Zhang,Shidong Pan,Zejun Zhang,Zhenchang Xing,Xiaoyu Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents IaCGen, an LLM-based framework for generating Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) templates with a focus on deployability, and DPIaC-Eval, a benchmark for evaluating IaC templates. The evaluation shows significant improvement in deployment success rates using IaCGen, but challenges remain in user intent alignment and security compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer opportunities to democratize IaC development by generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language descriptions, yet current evaluations overly focus on syntactic correctness rather than deployability.

Method: The authors developed two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based framework that uses an iterative feedback mechanism to generate IaC templates; and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a benchmark consisting of 153 real-world scenarios to evaluate syntax, deployment, user intent, and security.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly in deployment success, but with IaCGen, all evaluated models achieved over 90% passItr@25. However, challenges persist in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4% pass rate).

Conclusion: The paper provides the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template generation, establishing a foundation for future research while highlighting areas needing further investigation.

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces DesignBench, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in automated front-end engineering across multiple frameworks and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for front-end UI code generation have limitations such as lack of mainstream development frameworks, focus only on UI code generation without considering iterations like editing and repairing, and unidimensional evaluation without analyzing influencing factors.

Method: DesignBench is developed which includes three widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) along with vanilla HTML/CSS, and evaluates MLLMs on three essential front-end tasks: generation, edit, and repair. It contains 900 webpage samples covering various topics, edit types, and issue categories.

Result: Systematic evaluation using DesignBench reveals insights into MLLMs' framework-specific limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under different conditions.

Conclusion: DesignBench provides guidance for future research in automated front-end development by offering a multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from
visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have
the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes
predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to
incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus
solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development
involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.
(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation
into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and
in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a
multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'
capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three
widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,
and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)
in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples
spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling
detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our
systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific
limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under
different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated
front-end development. Our code and data are available at

*Shibo Li,Yao Zheng*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for online model selection for nonstationary time series which combines conformal inference with model confidence sets. It can reliably and efficiently identify optimal models under nonstationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical model selection methods rely on the stationarity assumption and fail in dynamic environments with changes over time. Real-world data are rarely stationary, so there is a need for a method that can handle nonstationarity.

Method: The MPS framework uses conformal inference and model confidence sets to adaptively select models suited to evolving dynamics. It updates in real time a confidence set of candidate models covering the best model for the next time period with a specified long-run probability while adapting to nonstationarity.

Result: Through simulations and real-world data analysis, MPS was shown to reliably and efficiently identify optimal models under nonstationarity. It also frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality.

Conclusion: MPS is a generic framework applicable across diverse problem settings, accommodating any data-generating process, data structure, model class, training method, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for
online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection
methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the
stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo
gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,
and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To
tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence
sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the
evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a
confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time
period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity
of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we
demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under
nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,
MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose
evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic
framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model
class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable
across diverse problem settings.

### [250] [Nonlinear Causal Discovery through a Sequential Edge Orientation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05590)
*Stella Huang,Qing Zhou*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sequential procedure and a novel constraint-based algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs, which is computationally efficient and robust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying causal DAGs have limitations such as restrictive model assumptions, heavy reliance on general independence tests, or requiring substantial computational time.

Method: The method involves using the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to orient undirected edges in a completed partial DAG (CPDAG), developing a ranking procedure for sorting undirected edges, devising a statistical test for determining edge direction, and establishing structural learning consistency of the algorithm.

Result: The algorithm can recover the true causal DAG assuming a restricted ANM. Experiments show that the method is computationally efficient, robust to model misspecification, and outperforms many existing nonlinear DAG learning methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective solution for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs, with proven efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances have established the identifiability of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) under additive noise models (ANMs), spurring the development of
various causal discovery methods. However, most existing methods make
restrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or
require substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we
propose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed
partial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging
the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.
We prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a
restricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based
algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated
CPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their
adherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To
determine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the
log-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a
sub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in
the partial DAG. We further establish the structural learning consistency of
our algorithm in the large-sample limit. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient,
robust to model misspecification, and consistently outperforms many existing
nonlinear DAG learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural SBI is crucial for Bayesian inference using simulators instead of explicit likelihoods, but its performance can be hindered by computationally expensive simulations.

Method: Proposes leveraging multilevel Monte Carlo techniques in neural SBI for scenarios with several simulators of varying cost and fidelity.

Result: Through theoretical analysis and experiments, the method significantly enhances the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.

Conclusion: The novel approach improves the efficiency and accuracy of neural SBI under computational constraints.

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for
Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator.
These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing
down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a
simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators
are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that
can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI
which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several
simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through
both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can
significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational
budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI methods focus on learning better human-object features, but this paper introduces a novel and complementary approach.

Method: Category query learning explicitly associates queries to interaction categories, converts them to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder, and learns them through an auxiliary image-level classification task.

Result: The method is validated on three representative HOI baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simple, general and effective for human-object interaction classification.

Abstract: Unlike most previous HOI methods that focus on learning better human-object

converted to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder,

motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the

TL;DR: GPT-4V在图像取证领域的初步研究，使用三种提示策略评估其检测图像拼接操作的能力，发现其在零样本设置下具有竞争力的检测性能，能够结合低级视觉伪影和现实世界上下文知识识别不合理的合成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4V）在图像取证领域中的即用能力，特别是在无需特定任务微调的情况下检测图像拼接操作的能力。

Method: 评估GPT-4V使用三种提示策略：零样本（Zero-Shot）、少量样本（Few-Shot）和思维链（Chain-of-Thought），应用在一个精选的CASIA v2.0拼接数据集子集上。

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下达到超过85%的准确率，其中思维链提示提供了最平衡的真实和拼接图像之间的权衡。定性分析表明模型不仅检测低级视觉伪影，还利用对象尺度、语义一致性和建筑事实等现实世界上下文知识来识别不合理的合成图像。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4V落后于专门的最先进的拼接检测模型，但其通用性、可解释性和百科全书式的推理能力突显了其作为图像取证中灵活工具的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Conclusion: This work explores the potential of generative AI in art and cultural heritage, raising important questions about cultural biases, digital images, and the use of deepfakes in education.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research

*Zhuoxuan Cai,Jian Zhang,Xinbin Yuan,Pengtao Jiang,Wenxiang Chen,Bowen Tang,Lujian Yao,Qiyuan Wang,Jinwen Chen,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Recent studies show MLLMs can evaluate visual quality well. However, existing methods treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions separately, leading to a trade-off. This paper proposes a two-stage training framework to address this issue, introducing Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder models. Experiments show Q-Ponder outperforms SOTA models in both score regression and description accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of existing approaches that treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions as separate tasks, which leads to a trade-off between scoring accuracy and interpretability.

Method: A unified two-stage training framework is proposed. The first stage involves distilling high-quality data from a teacher model through expert-designed prompts and initializing reasoning capabilities via cross-entropy loss supervision. The second stage introduces a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency.

Result: Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art performance on quality score regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets. It also significantly outperforms description-based SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, in description accuracy and reasonableness.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage training framework effectively addresses the trade-off between scoring accuracy and interpretability, demonstrating the potential for generalization over diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image
captioning.

*Lianming Huang,Haibo Hu,Yufei Cui,Jiacheng Zuo,Shangyu Wu,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In autonomous driving, using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is common but hindered by high latency and computational overhead. This paper proposes AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that reduces latency by up to 57.58% and enhances object detection accuracy by up to 44%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the inefficiency in real-time application of VLMs in autonomous driving due to high latency and computational overhead, particularly when VLMs exhibit over-inference.

Method: The proposed method is AD-EE, an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs on large-scale real-world datasets show that the method significantly reduces latency (maximum improvements reaching up to 57.58%) and enhances object detection accuracy (maximum gains of up to 44%).

Conclusion: AD-EE effectively addresses the inefficiency issue in VLMs for autonomous driving, significantly reducing latency and enhancing object detection accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

*Mingfei Chen,Zijun Cui,Xiulong Liu,Jinlin Xiang,Caleb Zheng,Jingyuan Li,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAVVY-Bench, a benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio, and proposes SAVVY, a training-free reasoning pipeline to tackle the challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks focus on static or 2D scenes, lacking exploration of 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments.

Method: SAVVY is a two-stage training-free reasoning pipeline: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which tracks object trajectories using both visual and spatial audio cues; and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories into a unified global dynamic map.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that SAVVY significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs in 3D spatial reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench sets a new standard for dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs, and SAVVY demonstrates substantial enhancement in performance.

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method is designed to extract task-relevant features efficiently in vision-based reinforcement learning, which uses weak and strong augmentations in parallel and learns representations by predicting inverse and forward transitions. It outperforms previous studies in complex observations and improves generalization performance for unseen observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based reinforcement learning needs efficient and robust representations of image-based observations, especially when images contain distracting elements that are not exposed during training.

Method: The SPD method designs weak and strong augmentations in parallel and learns representations by predicting inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions.

Result: SPD outperforms previous studies in complex observations and significantly improves the generalization performance for unseen observations in MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA).

Conclusion: SPD is an effective method to extract task-relevant features in vision-based reinforcement learning and can improve the generalization performance for unseen observations.

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dr. G is a novel self-supervised method for zero-shot MBRL that enhances robustness against visual distractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, but fail when faced with visual distractions.

Method: Dr. G trains its encoder and world model with dual contrastive learning to capture task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations, and introduces a recurrent state inverse dynamics model to better understand the temporal structure.

Result: Dr. G yields a performance improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works on DeepMind Control suite and Robosuite respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed methods can enhance the robustness of the world model against visual distractions.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类社会互动的丰富性和多面性（包括多模态线索、不可观察的关系和心理状态以及动态行为）对人工智能提出了重大挑战。为了推动这一领域的研究，需要一个专门的基准来评估多模态大语言模型在社交场景理解、社交状态推理和社交动态预测方面的能力。

Method: 引入了 SIV-Bench，这是一个包含2792个视频片段和8792个精心生成的问题-答案对的新视频基准。数据集来源于 TikTok 和 YouTube，涵盖了广泛的视频类型、展示风格和语言文化背景。还包括一个专门设置，用于分析不同文本提示（原始屏幕文本、添加的对话或无文本）的影响。通过全面实验评估领先多模态大语言模型的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，多模态大语言模型在社交场景理解方面表现出色，但在社交状态推理和社交动态预测方面存在显著困难。关系推理被确认为一个严重的瓶颈。此外，转录对话被证明在帮助理解复杂社交互动方面具有重要作用。

Conclusion: SIV-Bench 系统地识别了当前多模态大语言模型的优势和局限性，为开发更具有社会智能的人工智能提供了重要见解。数据集和代码已公开发布。

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

TL;DR: A generic surrogate model is trained to generate adversarial perturbations for both text and image modalities, which outperforms other multi-modal attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of vision-language models by creating perturbations in both vision and language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies.

Method: Train a generic surrogate model that takes image and text as input to generate joint representation used for generating adversarial perturbations for both modalities.

Result: The proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal and single-modality attacks on visual question and answering and visual reasoning datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Conclusion: This coordinated attack strategy demonstrates effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art pre-trained multi-modal models.

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视频分类模型的鲁棒性具有挑战性，尤其是与基于图像的模型相比，因为视频的时间维度增加导致复杂性和计算成本显著提高。因此需要一种新的方法来最小化扰动以诱导误分类。

Method: 提出一种多智能体强化学习（空间和时间）方法，通过考虑时间连贯性来生成精细的扰动，从而实现更有效且视觉上不易察觉的攻击。该方法允许自定义失真类型，使鲁棒性评估更符合实际使用情况。

Result: 该方法在Lp度量和平均查询次数上优于现有解决方案，并对4个流行的视频动作识别模型进行了广泛评估。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效识别视频中的敏感空间和时间区域，并生成有效的、视觉上不易察觉的扰动，有助于更好地评估视频分类模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

TL;DR: 尽管CLIP视觉表示存在已知的局限性，但它们为语言解码器提供了现成的语义信息。然而，在视觉表示的情境化减少的情况下，语言解码器可以很大程度上弥补这一缺陷并恢复性能。这表明了VLMs中动态的任务分工，并激励了将更多视觉处理任务交给语言解码器的未来架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者们希望探讨在多模态模型（VLMs）中，强大的语言主干网络是否可以通过情境化或丰富可能较弱的视觉特征来弥补其不足。

Method: 通过使用三个基于CLIP的VLMs，在精心设计的探测任务上进行受控的自注意力消融实验。

Result: 研究发现CLIP视觉表示尽管存在局限性，但能为语言解码器提供直接可用的语义信息；当视觉表示的情境化程度降低时，语言解码器能够显著补偿这种缺陷并恢复性能。

Conclusion: 本研究表明VLMs中存在动态的任务分工，并提出了未来可将更多视觉处理任务分配给语言解码器的架构方向。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Conclusion: 这种新方法提供了一种更精确、更有针对性和可解释性的VLM评估方式，有助于深入理解VLM的能力和局限性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise for autonomous driving, but current VLMs have limitations such as unfriendly datasets and high computational costs. This paper introduces NuScenes-S, a structured benchmark dataset, and FastDrive, a compact VLM with 0.9B parameters. FastDrive improves decision-making accuracy by 20% and inference speed by over 10x compared to models with over 7B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gaps between current Vision-Language Models and real-world autonomous driving applications, specifically focusing on making datasets more machine-friendly and reducing the high computational costs associated with large-scale VLMs.

Method: Introduced NuScenes-S, a concise and structured benchmark dataset derived from NuScenes. Also presented FastDrive, a compact VLM with 0.9B parameters that processes structured descriptions and generates efficient driving decisions.

Result: FastDrive achieves competitive performance on structured datasets, improving decision-making accuracy by approximately 20% and achieving over 10x speedup in inference compared to larger models. Ablation studies highlight the importance of scene annotations on decision-making tasks.

Conclusion: FastDrive offers a promising direction for efficient end-to-end autonomous driving solutions with its compact design, improved accuracy, and significant speedup.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: MORSE-500能够随着模型的进步而进化，支持创建更具挑战性的新实例，为透明、可重复和前瞻性的多模态推理研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑部MRI中的颅外组织对于健康状况的描述和临床决策具有重要意义，但目前很少被量化，且现有工具尚未得到广泛验证。

Method: TissUnet是一种基于深度学习的模型，能够从常规的三维T1加权MRI（有或无对比增强）中分割出颅骨、皮下脂肪和肌肉。模型使用155对配对的MRI-CT扫描进行训练，并在涵盖广泛年龄段和包括脑肿瘤患者的九个数据集上进行验证。

Result: 与AI-CT衍生标签相比，TissUnet在健康成人队列中实现了0.79的中位数Dice系数；在专家手动注释验证中，健康个体的中位数Dice系数为0.83，肿瘤病例为0.81，优于先前最先进的方法。接受度测试显示了89%的接受率，且在盲审比较审查中表现出色。

Conclusion: TissUnet能够实现颅外组织的快速、准确和可重复的分割，支持使用标准脑T1w MRI进行的大规模研究，包括头面部形态、治疗效果和心脏代谢风险等方面。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,

*Yuhan Hao,Zhengning Li,Lei Sun,Weilong Wang,Naixin Yi,Sheng Song,Caihong Qin,Mofan Zhou,Yifei Zhan,Peng Jia,Xianpeng Lang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but benchmarks lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. DriveAction is introduced to address these limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for VLA models in autonomous driving lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences.

Method: DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from 2,610 driving scenarios. It leverages real-world driving data collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles, offers high-level discrete action labels from users' actual driving operations, and implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework.

Result: State-of-the-art vision-language models require both vision and language guidance for accurate action prediction: accuracy drops by 3.3% without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without either.

Conclusion: DriveAction provides a rigorous foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

*Meng Fan,Yifan Zuo,Patrick Blaes,Harley Montgomery,Subhasis Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新颖且与模型无关的方法，通过每点时间戳偏移特征和数据增强策略解决传感器数据延迟问题，提升自动驾驶车辆感知系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器融合在自动驾驶车辆的感知系统中至关重要，但不同传感器数据到达时存在的时间延迟（传感器陈旧性）带来了重大挑战。这种时间上的错位导致物体状态估计不一致，严重影响了对轨迹预测的质量，而轨迹预测对于安全至关重要。

Method: 论文提出了两种方法：1) 每点时间戳偏移特征（针对LiDAR和雷达相对于相机），实现传感器融合中的细粒度时间意识；2) 数据增强策略，模拟部署车辆中观察到的真实传感器延迟模式。这些方法被整合进一个视角检测模型，该模型可处理来自多个LiDAR、雷达和相机的传感器数据。

Result: 实验表明，传统模型在一个传感器模态陈旧时表现显著退步，而本文提出的方法在同步和陈旧条件下均能保持良好的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法解决了传感器延迟带来的挑战，在多种条件下提高了传感器融合的性能，从而增强了自动驾驶车辆感知系统的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

*Quansong He,Xiangde Min,Kaishen Wang,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel multi-scale feature fusion method for UNet family models, reformulating the decoding process as an initial value problem and using an adaptive ODE approach to enhance feature interaction and integration. This method improves segmentation performance while reducing network parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of skip connections in UNet architectures, specifically the lack of effective multi-scale feature interaction and reliance on simple operations for information integration.

Method: The method involves reimagining the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. It leverages principles from the linear multistep method and proposes an adaptive ordinary differential equation method for multi-scale feature fusion. This approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures.

Result: Experiments on various datasets (ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, ISIC2017/2018) show improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance in medical image segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-scale feature fusion method effectively enhances the capabilities of U-Net-like networks by improving feature interaction and integration, making it adaptable to different architectures and demonstrating strong performance in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper presents a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation approach for the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence Challenges 2025, proposing a multimodal condition fusion module and a cross-view object alignment module. It ranked second in a large-scale benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the object correspondence task across different views (ego and exo) by predicting corresponding object masks given queries from one perspective.

Method: A multimodal condition fusion module is proposed to enhance object localization using visual masks and textual descriptions. A cross-view object alignment module is also introduced to ensure object-level consistency across perspectives and improve robustness to viewpoint changes.

Result: The method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object correspondence benchmark.

Conclusion: The presented cross-view multi-modal object segmentation approach effectively addresses the object correspondence task, demonstrating strong performance in a major benchmark.

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

TL;DR: HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM) is an end-to-end driving framework that upgrades the slow branch of a fast-slow architecture, with three key innovations leading to high performance in the 2025 Waymo E2E Driving Challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust driving framework that combines low-level vehicle control with high-level decision-making through a large vision-language model, improving on existing methods by reducing latency and enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Method: HMVLM introduces selective five-view prompting with ego kinematics history, multi-stage chain-of-thought prompting for structured reasoning, and spline-based trajectory post-processing to smooth outputs. It leverages the Waymo Open Dataset for training.

Result: Achieved a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, placing second in the 2025 Waymo Vision-based End-to-End Driving Challenge and surpassing the public baseline by 2.77%.

Conclusion: The HMVLM framework successfully implements enhancements to the slow planner in a fast-slow architecture, demonstrating superior performance in autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public
baseline by 2.77%.

### [275] [Rethinking Semi-supervised Segmentation Beyond Accuracy: Reliability and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05917)
*Steven Landgraf,Markus Hillemann,Markus Ulrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a new metric evaluating segmentation models' accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality holistically. It reveals semi-supervised methods often trade reliability for accuracy and advocates for more comprehensive evaluation protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for semi-supervised segmentation focus exclusively on accuracy, ignoring reliability and robustness which are crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving.

Method: The authors propose RSS, a harmonic mean-based metric combining predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures. They evaluate UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a supervised baseline using this metric.

Result: Semi-supervised methods often sacrifice reliability for accuracy. Out-of-domain evaluations show UniMatchV2's robustness but also highlight persistent reliability issues.

Conclusion: The authors recommend adopting more holistic metrics like RSS in evaluation protocols to align semi-supervised learning research with practical deployment requirements.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

*Yixuan Zhu,Haolin Wang,Shilin Ma,Wenliang Zhao,Yansong Tang,Lei Chen,Jie Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new video editing approach named FADE is introduced which overcomes the limitations of conventional methods by leveraging pre-trained video diffusion models through frequency-aware factorization. It provides high-quality, realistic and temporally coherent editing results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches using image diffusion models are not adept at handling video dynamics, especially challenging temporal edits like motion adjustments. Current video diffusion models produce high-quality results but are computationally heavy making it difficult to adapt them for efficient editing.

Method: FADE, a training-free video editing approach, leverages inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization. The method involves analyzing attention patterns within the video model, proposing a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role, and devising spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling trajectory with frequency domain cues.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world videos show that FADE consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: FADE is a highly effective video editing approach that fully utilizes pre-trained video diffusion models, providing efficient and versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and temporal structure.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

*Dongjie Fu,Tengjiao Sun,Pengcheng Fang,Xiaohao Cai,Hansung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOGO, a new autoregressive framework for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation using MoSA-VQ and RQHC-Transformer components. It achieves competitive quality with reduced latency and enhanced semantic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based text-to-motion generation methods struggle to balance high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time responsiveness, and scalability.

Method: MOGO uses MoSA-VQ for hierarchical discretization of motion sequences and RQHC-Transformer for generating multi-layer motion tokens in one pass. A text condition alignment mechanism is also introduced to improve motion decoding under textual control.

Result: MOGO shows competitive or superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets like HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP, with improvements in real-time performance, streaming generation, and zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: MOGO addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality, real-time, scalable 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

*Çağlar Hızlı,Çağatay Yıldız,Pekka Marttinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ODIS, a pretraining method using object-level self-distillation which improves visual representations and achieves high accuracy on ImageNet1k.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision pretraining methods rely on image-level self-distillation from object-centric datasets like ImageNet, but these methods assume single-object images which is not always true and limits scalability to more complex datasets.

Method: ODIS shifts self-distillation granularity from whole images to individual objects by using object-aware cropping and masked attention, transforming scene-level tasks into object-level sub-tasks.

Result: This approach enhances visual representations at both image and patch levels, achieving an 82.6% k-NN accuracy on ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

Conclusion: ODIS improves the quality of visual representations through object-level self-distillation, making it effective for complex, scene-centric datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉-语言基础模型是否具备现实世界模型（观察×动作→观察）和动力学模型（观察×观察→动作），特别是在动作通过语言表达时。

Method: 1. 使用动力学模型为未标记的视频帧观察对注释动作以扩展训练数据；2. 提出新的目标函数，根据识别模型预测的重要性对观察对中的图像标记进行加权；3. 动力学模型为世界模型的多个样本分配奖励以评分，从而在推理时引导搜索。

Result: 最佳模型在Aurora-Bench上的表现与最先进的图像编辑模型相当，并在GPT4o-as-judge评估中提高了15%，且在所有子集上获得了最好的平均人类评价。

Conclusion: 精细调整基础模型以获得动力学模型比获得世界模型更容易，而动力学模型可以通过弱监督学习和推理时间验证来引导世界模型的构建。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

*Shiyi Zhang,Dong Liang,Hairong Zheng,Yihang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new method called HAVIR is proposed to reconstruct visual information from brain activity with better accuracy, especially for complex stimuli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity is a bridge between neuroscience and computer vision, but accurately recovering complex visual stimuli remains challenging due to their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information.

Method: The proposed HAVIR contains two adapters: AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior capturing topological structures; CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image.

Result: Experimental results show that HAVIR can effectively reconstruct both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: HAVIR is an effective approach for reconstructing visual information from brain activity, especially for complex visual stimuli.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based segmentation models for SAR images face challenges related to convergence speed and stability due to the complex statistical distribution of SAR data.

Method: The study integrates mode normalization into U-Net and SegNet models to reduce convergence time while maintaining performance.

Result: Experimental results show that mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence and cross-validation indicates increased stability in different zones.

Conclusion: Normalization is effective in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR
image segmentation.

*Diji Yang,Minghao Liu,Chung-Hsiang Lo,Yi Zhang,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in text-to-image retrieval, but applying this to real-world scenarios is challenging. This study introduces Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), focusing on multi-round user interactions for image search refinement. The proposed GenIR uses diffusion-based image generation to provide clear feedback and improve query refinement. Experiments show GenIR outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs perform well in benchmarks but struggle in practical applications due to the complex, multi-step nature of human search behavior.

Method: The study proposes GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval method using diffusion-based image generation to create synthetic visual feedback. This feedback helps users refine their queries more intuitively. Additionally, an automated pipeline is introduced to generate a high-quality MIR dataset.

Result: Experimental results indicate that GenIR significantly surpasses current interactive retrieval methods in the MIR context.

Conclusion: This work defines a new task called Mental Image Retrieval, provides a corresponding dataset, and presents an effective generative retrieval approach, laying the groundwork for future research in interactive image search.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with

*Zahra Babaiee,Peyman M. Kiasari,Daniela Rus,Radu Grosu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have shown significant promise in visual question answering, but still lack the human ability of 'conceptualization'. To address this, researchers have developed the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset with six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and enhance AI's visual abstraction capabilities. Experiments revealed that while humans performed nearly perfectly, AI models showed severe limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need to bridge the gap in AI systems' ability to conceptualize - recognizing and reasoning about the same concept despite variations in visual form, which is a fundamental human reasoning skill.

Method: The method involves introducing the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset featuring six graph-based tasks that evaluate AI systems' capacity for visual abstraction using diverse graph layouts to test reasoning independent of visual form.

Result: The results show that humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, whereas AI models failed on isomorphism detection and had limited success in path/cycle tasks. Behavioral anomalies were identified suggesting pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual understanding and suggests that VGA provides a framework to drive progress towards human-like conceptualization in AI visual models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method using a Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT) device with 32 images for allergy wheal detection and delineation, showing higher accuracy than conventional single-image methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve consistency and accuracy in diagnosing sensitization to inhalant allergies by utilizing the SPAT device's unique capability of capturing multiple images under distinct lighting conditions.

Method: The method involves manually annotating wheals, using a neural network for pixel-level segmentation, and applying an algorithmic approach for wheal detection and delineation.

Result: The proposed method achieves considerably higher accuracy on a validation set compared to using a single conventionally lighted image.

Conclusion: Using 32 SPAT images under various lighting conditions provides significantly better accuracy than traditional single-image methods.

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

### [286] [Sample-Specific Noise Injection For Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06027)
*Yuhao Sun,Jiacheng Zhang,Zesheng Ye,Chaowei Xiao,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SSNI, a framework that adaptively adjusts the noise level injected into samples during diffusion-based purification (DBP) based on their deviation from clean data distribution, leading to improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DBP methods use a constant noise level for all samples, but the authors discover that the optimal noise level can vary between samples. Cleaner samples should receive less noise injection while noisier samples require more.

Method: SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate deviations from the clean data distribution (score norms). Based on these norms, a reweighting function adaptively adjusts the noise level $t^*$ for each sample.

Result: Empirical results show incorporating SSNI with existing DBP methods improves both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K datasets.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of using distinct noise levels for different samples in DBP methods, and demonstrates SSNI's effectiveness in achieving this.

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

*Joscha Diehl,Rasheed Ibraheem,Leonard Schmitz,Yue Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer using 'corner trees' for efficient tensor-to-tensor processing in deep learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in classification and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of processing high-dimensional image or tensor data efficiently in deep learning applications, aiming to reduce computational cost without sacrificing performance.

Method: Propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost called FIS layer, based on 'corner trees' from permutation counting. This layer generalizes state-space models and iterated integrals, and can be integrated into neural network architectures for tasks like classification and anomaly detection.

Result: Replacing some layers in ResNet with FIS achieved similar accuracy with fewer parameters and operations. Anomaly detection model using FIS reached an average AUROC of 97.3% on MVTec AD dataset.

Conclusion: The FIS layer offers an efficient alternative for processing high-dimensional tensor data, reducing computational resources while maintaining or improving performance in various tasks.

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing

*Taoran Yue,Xiaojin Lu,Jiaxi Cai,Yuanping Chen,Shibing Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Current CNN-based IRSTD methods face challenges due to heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, inefficient collaboration, and lack of systematic modeling for feature fusion. To address these, this paper proposes SDS-Net, a dual-branch architecture that separately models structural characteristics and semantic properties of features while incorporating an adaptive feature fusion module. This design enhances detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and inference speed. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance with low complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in overcoming the limitations of existing CNN-based IRSTD methods that overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to inefficient feature collaboration and underutilized complementarity of multilevel features.

Method: SDS-Net introduces a dual-branch architecture for separately modeling structural characteristics and semantic properties of features. It also incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, improving overall feature collaboration and representation capability.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods with low computational complexity and high inference efficiency.

Conclusion: SDS-Net achieves superior detection performance and broad application prospects in IRSTD tasks by efficiently modeling multilevel feature representations, enhancing both detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

### [289] [A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155)
*Wenyuan Li,Shunlin Liang,Yuxiang Zhang,Liqin Liu,Keyan Chen,Yongzhe Chen,Han Ma,Jianglei Xu,Yichuan Ma,Shikang Guan,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and food security monitoring. The paper introduces H2Crop, a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset combining EnMAP hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series, and proposes a dual-stream Transformer architecture to process these modalities synergistically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research combining phenological dynamics and subtle spectral variations for fine-grained crop classification is scarce due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and annotation costs.

Method: The authors construct the H2Crop dataset by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. They propose a dual-stream Transformer architecture consisting of a spectral-spatial Transformer for hyperspectral data and a temporal Swin Transformer for Sentinel-2 time series, with hierarchy classification heads for multi-level classification.

Result: Experiments show a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%) when adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series. The method outperforms existing deep learning approaches for crop type classification across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Conclusion: H2Crop establishes a vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and hyperspectral image processing. The proposed dual-stream Transformer architecture effectively leverages both hyperspectral and temporal data for improved classification accuracy.

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

TL;DR: 尽管视觉-语言模型(VLMs)近期有所进展，但长篇视频内容的整体理解仍面临重大挑战。为解决当前基准测试的局限性，本文提出了MF$^2$新基准，用于评估模型对全长电影关键叙事信息的理解、整合和回忆能力。MF$^2$包括50多部全长、开放许可的电影，并配有手动构建的850多对声明（事实与虚构），针对核心叙事元素。实验表明，最先进的模型在人类水平上还有很大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的基准测试存在局限性，许多关注细节而非整体理解，或者依赖大规模半自动生成的问题，无法反映真正的理解能力。因此需要一个更全面的基准来评估模型对长篇视频内容的理解能力。

Method: 提出MF$^2$基准，包括50多部全长电影和850多对声明（事实与虚构）。采用二元声明评估协议，要求模型正确识别每对声明中的事实和虚构部分。

Result: 实验表明，无论是开放权重还是封闭状态的最先进模型，在MF$^2$基准上的表现远低于人类水平，显示出模型在保留和推理关键叙事信息方面的能力不足。

Conclusion: 当前的VLMs在理解和推理长篇视频内容的关键叙事信息方面存在明显不足，而人类在这方面表现出色。MF$^2$提供了一个新的基准来更好地评估和推动这一领域的发展。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

TL;DR: The paper presents QualitEye, a method for verifying image-based gaze data quality that addresses data quality and privacy concerns when collecting large datasets. It uses a new semantic representation of eye images and private set intersection protocols, achieving high verification performance on MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaze-based applications are advancing rapidly due to the availability of large datasets, but ensuring data quality is a major challenge when collecting data at scale. Collaboration between different parties is necessary, which raises privacy concerns.

Method: QualitEye employs a new semantic representation of eye images that includes necessary information for verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain adaptation. It covers both a public setting where parties can freely exchange data and a privacy-preserving setting where raw data cannot be revealed nor can gaze features/labels of others be derived using adapted private set intersection protocols.

Result: Evaluated on the MPIIFaceGaze and GazeCapture datasets, QualitEye achieves high verification performance with only a small runtime overhead for privacy-preserving versions.

Conclusion: QualitEye addresses significant challenges in gaze-based application development by ensuring data quality and preserving privacy. It opens up possibilities for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning, human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Abstract: Gaze-based applications are increasingly advancing with the availability of
large datasets but ensuring data quality presents a substantial challenge when
collecting data at scale. It further requires different parties to collaborate,
therefore, privacy concerns arise. We propose QualitEye--the first method for
verifying image-based gaze data quality. QualitEye employs a new semantic
representation of eye images that contains the information required for
verification while excluding irrelevant information for better domain
adaptation. QualitEye covers a public setting where parties can freely exchange
data and a privacy-preserving setting where parties cannot reveal their raw
data nor derive gaze features/labels of others with adapted private set
intersection protocols. We evaluate QualitEye on the MPIIFaceGaze and
GazeCapture datasets and achieve a high verification performance (with a small
overhead in runtime for privacy-preserving versions). Hence, QualitEye paves
the way for new gaze analysis methods at the intersection of machine learning,
human-computer interaction, and cryptography.

Motivation: The shift to online learning platforms due to the pandemic has impacted teacher-student communication, especially non-verbal communication, leading to a reliance on verbal feedback which lessens educational efficacy.

Method: Involves data preparation, feature selection, and development of a deep neural network model with word embedding, LSTM, and attention mechanisms for sentiment analysis of student feedback in LMS.

Result: The deep neural network model is compared against a logistic regression baseline to assess its effectiveness in understanding student feedback.

Conclusion: This study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students in online learning environments by providing insights into the emotional context of student feedback, thereby improving online education quality.

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field of computer science and identify possible traditional uses of scenarios that are not yet covered but have the potential to enrich the field.

Method: Conducting a systematic literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science over the last decade (n = 59).

Result: Uncovered how scenarios are used in computing literature, focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used and dived deeper into the participatory element of the existing scenario building literature in computer science.

Conclusion: The use of scenario building methods in computer science has the potential to enhance inclusivity in research.

Abstract: Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of
emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future
trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following
this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can
be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer
science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play
such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how
scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what
possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the
potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic
literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science
over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions.
First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature,
focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in
following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in
research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing

TL;DR: This study explores how high school students perceive AI-generated characters in a scenario-based assessment (SBA) context, focusing on trust, social presence, and effectiveness. Through PLS-SEM analysis and qualitative methods, it finds that trust influences social presence and perceived effectiveness of AI characters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the gap between classroom learning and individualized learning/assessment practices, along with advancements in multimodal AI technology. This drives the exploration of using AI-generated characters in educational scenarios to foster complex competencies.

Method: Mixed-methods approach including Likert scale responses from 56 high school students regarding trust, social presence, and effectiveness of AI characters in an SBA context. PLS-SEM was used for quantitative analysis, and qualitative analysis further explored factors fostering trust and the role of social presence.

Result: Quantitative results showed learners' trust impacts their sense of social presence with AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative findings highlighted material credibility and alignment with learning goals as trust-building factors.

Conclusion: AI-generated characters can play effective roles as mentors and teammates in SBAs, promoting collaborative learning experiences. The study underscores the importance of trust and social presence in integrating AI characters into educational settings.

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical
approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between
in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment
practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated
characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment
(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of
competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents
to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the
assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability
of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as
text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated
characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI
characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the
context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the
Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,
and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and
their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our
findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence
with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis
further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and
alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence
in creating a collaborative context.

Conclusion: Designing effective AI literacy education for older adults presents challenges and opportunities, highlighting the need for further exploration in this area.

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.

*Lama Alqazlan,Zheng Fang,Michael Castelle,Rob Procter*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Big data impacts social science research. Qualitative analysis faces challenges with large datasets. Integrating computational methods can help, but trustworthiness is a concern. A 'human-in-the-loop' methodology is proposed for Computational Grounded Theory (CGT) to maintain rigour while analysing large qualitative datasets. It was tested on a Reddit dataset to understand tutors' experiences in the gig economy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of applying conventional qualitative data analysis methods to large datasets and ensure the trustworthiness of results when using ML and NLP tools.

Method: Proposing a 'human-in-the-loop' methodology within a novel Computational Grounded Theory (CGT) framework for analysing large qualitative datasets.

Result: The framework was tested on a Reddit dataset, demonstrating its potential value in maintaining the rigour of Grounded Theory methodologies while enabling the analysis of large datasets.

Conclusion: A 'human-in-the-loop' approach in CGT can support robust and credible analysis of large qualitative datasets, as shown by its application in understanding tutors' experiences in the gig economy.

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: ALLMs can be used as judges to assess speaking styles of speeches generated by SLMs, with Gemini showing comparable agreement to human judges. Current SLMs still need improvement in controlling speaking style and generating natural dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of ALLMs as automatic judges for evaluating speaking styles in speeches generated by SLMs, focusing on aspects like emotion, volume, pace, emphasis, pitch, and non-verbal elements.

Method: Using four SLMs to complete two tasks (voice style instruction following and role-playing) and evaluating their responses with both human judges and two ALLM judges (GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro).

Result: Gemini-2.5-pro shows agreement with human judges comparable to the agreement between human evaluators, indicating the viability of ALLMs as judges. However, current SLMs, including GPT-4o-audio, require improvement in controlling speaking style and generating natural dialogues.

Conclusion: ALLMs can effectively serve as judges for evaluating speaking styles in generated speeches, but there is still room for improvement in SLMs' abilities to control speaking style and produce natural dialogues.

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

### [298] [Improving Neural Diarization through Speaker Attribute Attractors and Local Dependency Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05593)
*David Palzer,Matthew Maciejewski,Eric Fosler-Lussier*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper enhances the EDA model for speaker diarization by focusing on speaker attributes and using conformers, showing improved performance on the CALLHOME dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end approaches have made significant progress in speaker diarization, but there is still room for improvement in handling variable speaker counts and guiding the network during training. The EDA model addresses some of these issues, but this study aims to further enhance it.

Method: The method involves extending the attractor paradigm beyond direct speaker modeling to represent more detailed speaker attributes through a multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, the architecture is enhanced by replacing transformers with conformers to better model local dependencies.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed enhancements lead to improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

Conclusion: The extension of the attractor paradigm and the use of conformers result in a more effective model for speaker diarization, as evidenced by the improved performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in
addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and
identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach,
Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker
counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we
extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and
instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a
multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance
the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a
convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments
demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

*Jakaria Islam Emon,Kazi Tamanna Alam,Md. Abu Salek*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper presents WhisQ, a multimodal architecture for predicting Mean Opinion Score (MOS) in text-to-music systems. It uses sequence level co-attention and optimal transport regularization, achieving significant improvements over the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment in text-to-music systems using MOS prediction.

Method: WhisQ employs Whisper Base for audio encoding and Qwen 3 for text encoding, with specialized prediction pathways OMQ and TA. It uses Sinkhorn optimal transport loss to enforce semantic alignment.

Result: On the MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ shows 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA compared to the baseline. Optimal transport regularization provides a 10% SRCC improvement.

Conclusion: Optimal transport regularization significantly enhances performance, highlighting the importance of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.

Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires
evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper
introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment
challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport
regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal
audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text
encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal
modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is
predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional
sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss
further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the
MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the
baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA.
Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the
largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance
of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.

*Keinichi Fujita,Shota Horiguchi,Yusuke Ijima*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Analyze the abstract of a paper about zero-shot TTS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is important for listeners' impression, but modulating it in zero-shot TTS remains challenging.

Method: Developed a voice impression control method using a low-dimensional vector to represent voice impression pairs intensities and used a large language model to generate this vector from natural language descriptions.

Result: Objective and subjective evaluations showed the effectiveness of the method in impression control.

Conclusion: The developed method successfully controls voice impressions in zero-shot TTS and allows target-impression generation from natural language without manual optimization.

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

*Zijian Yang,Minh-Nghia Phan,Ralf Schlüter,Hermann Ney*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores how connectionist temporal classification (CTC) can learn context-dependent internal language models (ILMs) despite its label context independence assumption, proposing novel ILM estimation methods based on knowledge distillation and two regularization techniques. Experiments indicate that context-dependent ILMs outperform context-independent ones in cross-domain evaluations, with significant improvements in word error rate when using the proposed methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the internal language model (ILM) of CTC, challenging the label context independence assumption.

Method: Propose new context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on knowledge distillation (KD), introduce two regularization methods for KD, and conduct experiments on Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain evaluation.

Result: Context-dependent ILMs outperform context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation, showing that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD with smoothing surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, achieving over 13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

Conclusion: CTC can implicitly learn context-dependent ILMs due to powerful encoders, and the proposed knowledge distillation-based methods with regularization significantly enhance performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

### [302] [Designing DSIC Mechanisms for Data Sharing in the Era of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05379)
*Seyed Moein Ayyoubzadeh,Kourosh Shahnazari,Mohammmadali Keshtparvar,MohammadAmin Fazli*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a mechanism-design framework for data sharing in training large language models (LLMs), which includes Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), Marginal Utility Token (MUT), and Mixed-MIA. These mechanisms ensure truthful data sharing, consider both quality and cost of data, and outperform existing methods theoretically and empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training LLMs requires massive high-quality data but current data procurement methods either rely on unverifiable trust or ignore heterogeneous provider costs.

Method: A model is formalized where providers privately know their data cost and quality. Based on this, Q-MIA ranks providers using a virtual cost metric and ensures DSIC and budget feasibility via Myerson-style payments. MUT allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. Mixed-MIA balances upfront payments and deferred rewards.

Result: The proposed mechanisms outperform volume-based and trust-based baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while remaining robust to misreporting and collusion.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a principled foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality
data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints.
Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore
heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for
truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive
compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while
rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model
where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises
solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we
propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks
providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure
DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or
long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which
allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in
Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards.
All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation.
Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based
baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while
remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled
foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯说服在一次性场景中有效，但在长期互动中面临计算复杂性（NP难）问题，需要一种新的方法来处理这种情况。

Method: 引入讨价还价视角，提供统一的框架和结构良好的解决方案概念，明确发送者的信息优势和先发提议优势之间的区别，并通过两阶段验证和推理范式进行验证。

Result: 提出了一种平衡的信息讨价还价框架，能够处理长期互动中的复杂性，并且通过实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 讨价还价视角为长期说服提供了一个公平和帕累托有效的解决方案，并重新解释了经典的单边说服为平衡信息讨价还价框架。

Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an
informed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's
actions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver
to verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating
cooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces
computational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions,
where the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes
and future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the
bargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and
well-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable
properties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction
between two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational
advantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the
standard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the
game structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,
thereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information
bargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage
validation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and
DeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We
then apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with
what our information-bargaining framework suggests. All code, results, and
terminal logs are publicly available at

### [304] [Microgrids Coalitions for Energy Market Balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06058)
*Viorica Chifu,Cristina Bianca Pop,Tudor Cioara,Ionut Anghel*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method that identifies an optimal coalition of microgrids to address energy market dynamics using a combination of cooperative game theory and a memetic algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution networks has created a need for intelligent mechanisms to balance the energy market, preventing imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability at the grid level.

Method: The method models the problem of identifying the optimal coalition as an optimization problem. It combines a strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and evolves over generations through recombination and mutation. The fitness function considers the total value generated by the coalition and penalties applied when the energy traded exceeds the available/demanded energy on the market.

Result: The proposed method successfully identifies an optimal coalition of microgrids capable of addressing the dynamics of the energy market, considering both profit from selling energy during deficit periods and savings from buying energy during surplus periods, while dividing the collective value equitably among members based on their contributions.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective way to manage the energy market dynamics through optimal coalition formation of microgrids, ensuring efficient energy trading and equitable value distribution.

Abstract: With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution
networks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy
market has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may
face imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability
at the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal
coalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or
supply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient
management of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that
identify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of
the energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the
optimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a
strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An
individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of
population of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and
mutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total
value generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when
the energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the
energy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the
profit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during
periods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy
on the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the
trading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,
according to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to
the formation of collective value.

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions
from the perspective of a single value-maximizing buyer who aims to maximize
their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to return-on-investment
(RoI) constraints in each round. Buyers adopt $m$-uniform bidding format, where
they submit $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid
$b_i$. We introduce safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy RoI
constraints in every auction, regardless of competing bids. We show that these
strategies depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can
focus on a finite subset of this class without loss of generality. While the
number of strategies in this subset is exponential in $m$, we develop a
polynomial-time algorithm to learn the optimal safe strategy that achieves
sublinear regret in the online setting, where regret is measured against a
clairvoyant benchmark that knows the competing bids a priori and selects a
fixed hindsight optimal safe strategy. We then evaluate the performance of safe
strategies against a clairvoyant that selects the optimal strategy from a
richer class of strategies in the online setting. In this scenario, we compute
the richness ratio, $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ for the class of strategies chosen by the
clairvoyant and show that our algorithm, designed to learn safe strategies,
achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger
benchmarks. Experiments on semi-synthetic data from real-world auctions show
that safe strategies substantially outperform the derived theoretical bounds,
making them quite appealing in practice.

*Vladimir Braverman,Jon C. Ergun,Chen Wang,Samson Zhou*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of a splitting oracle in hierarchical clustering to overcome approximation hardness, achieving improved approximations for Dasgupta and Moseley-Wang objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing hierarchical clustering algorithms due to hardness of approximation, this work introduces auxiliary information from oracles to enhance algorithm performance.

Method: A splitting oracle is employed to identify which vertex separates from others in an optimal tree. Using this oracle, polynomial-time and near-linear time algorithms are developed to approximate Dasgupta and Moseley-Wang objectives respectively.

Result: Achieves $O(1)$-approximation for Dasgupta objective and $(1-o(1))$-approximation for Moseley-Wang objective, demonstrating superior performance compared to standard methods under plausible computational assumptions.

Conclusion: The incorporation of splitting oracles significantly improves hierarchical clustering algorithms' ability to overcome approximation hardness barriers, with extensions to sublinear settings such as streaming and PRAM models.

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering (HC) is an important data analysis technique in which
the goal is to recursively partition a dataset into a tree-like structure while
grouping together similar data points at each level of granularity.
Unfortunately, for many of the proposed HC objectives, there exist strong
barriers to approximation algorithms with the hardness of approximation. Thus,
we consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information
from natural oracles. Specifically, we focus on a *splitting oracle* which,
when provided with a triplet of vertices $(u,v,w)$, answers (possibly
erroneously) the pairs of vertices whose lowest common ancestor includes all
three vertices in an optimal tree, i.e., identifying which vertex ``splits
away'' from the others. Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:
  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).
  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang
[NeurIPS'17]).
  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time
algorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or
$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.
As such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms
to outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.
Furthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new
streaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees.

*Boyuan Deng,Luca Rossini,Jin Wang,Weijie Wang,Nikolaos Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a learning-based framework for adaptive recovery of wheeled-legged robots using Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping, curriculum learning, and asymmetric actor-critic architecture. Synergistic wheel-leg coordination reduces joint torque consumption and improves stabilization. Evaluations on two quadruped platforms achieve high recovery success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents is crucial for the practical deployment of wheeled-legged robots, but traditional methods often fail to produce robust recovery policies due to reliance on preplanned motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards.

Method: The method integrates Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and curriculum learning to balance exploration with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic architecture is used to accelerate training with privileged information in simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against uncertainties. Synergistic wheel-leg coordination is also employed to reduce joint torque consumption and improve stabilization.

Result: Evaluations on two distinct quadruped platforms achieved recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8% without platform-specific tuning. Joint torque consumption was reduced by 15.8% and 26.2%, and stabilization was improved through energy transfer mechanisms.

Conclusion: The proposed learning-based framework successfully enables robust adaptive recovery for wheeled-legged robots by integrating advanced reward shaping, curriculum learning, and synergistic wheel-leg coordination.

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical
deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs
with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods
relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards
often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a
learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and
curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery
maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic
architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in
simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against
uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination
reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization
through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct
quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%

*Chongshang Yan,Jiaxuan He,Delun Li,Yi Yang,Wenjie Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve success rate and efficiency in zero-shot object navigation tasks. Experimental results show significant improvements over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges faced by zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments, which often suffer from performance decline due to neglecting high-dimensional implicit scene information and long-range target searching tasks.

Method: The proposed method includes two main components: EAM and MHR. EAM constructs environmental maps by reasoning observed environments with SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, leveraging human space regularities underlying object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR performs frontier exploration decision-making inspired by EAM, avoiding circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to enhance path efficiency.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5% scene mapping accuracy on the MP3D dataset. In terms of navigation task performance, it attains SPLs of 28.4% and 26.3% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively, representing absolute improvements of 21.4% and 46.0% over baseline methods.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed active object navigation framework with EAM and MHR effectively improves the success rate and efficiency of ZSON tasks, as evidenced by the significant performance improvements over baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments

rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.

Abstract: Efficient Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is necessary for autonomous robotic
lawnmowers to effectively navigate and maintain lawns with diverse and
irregular shapes. This paper introduces a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for

TL;DR: Astra is a dual-model architecture for mobile robot navigation which includes Astra-Global and Astra-Local. Astra-Global uses multimodal LLM for self and goal localization while Astra-Local handles local path planning and odometry estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern robot navigation systems face challenges in diverse and complex indoor environments due to reliance on multiple modules with small models or rule-based systems, leading to lack of adaptability to new environments.

Method: Astra-Global, a multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map. Astra-Local, a multitask network, has a 4D spatial-temporal encoder trained through self-supervised learning for robust 4D features. The planning head uses flow matching and a novel masked ESDF loss for trajectory generation, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor inputs via a transformer encoder for relative pose prediction.

Conclusion: Astra addresses the difficulties faced by modern robot navigation systems in diverse and complex indoor environments through its comprehensive dual-model architecture.

Abstract: Modern robot navigation systems encounter difficulties in diverse and complex
indoor environments. Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small
models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To
address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture,
Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a
multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal
localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and
outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a
multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D
spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates
robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow
matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for
generating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor
inputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot.
Deployed on real in-house mobile robots, Astra achieves high end-to-end mission
success rate across diverse indoor environments.

*Hongyi Zhou,Weiran Liao,Xi Huang,Yucheng Tang,Fabian Otto,Xiaogang Jia,Xinkai Jiang,Simon Hilber,Ge Li,Qian Wang,Ömer Erdinç Yağmurlu,Nils Blank,Moritz Reuss,Rudolf Lioutikov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces BEAST, a new action tokenizer using B-splines that requires no separate training and produces uniform tokens enabling fast generation of smooth trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing action tokenizers which require separate training and do not produce tokens of uniform length, leading to challenges in parallel decoding and trajectory smoothness.

Method: BEAST uses B-splines to encode action sequences into compact discrete or continuous tokens. It is integrated with three model architectures: VAE, decoder-only Transformer, and Florence-2 for evaluation.

Result: BEAST reduces computational costs, generates smooth high-frequency control signals, and achieves competitive task success rates across benchmarks and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: BEAST offers an efficient method for action sequence tokenization, providing advantages in both computational efficiency and trajectory quality.

Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel
action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or
continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers
based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate
tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling
fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline
formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without
discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by
integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with
discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an
encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and
scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three
established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct
robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference
computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency
control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably
achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Elim Kwan,Rehman Qureshi,Liam Fletcher,Colin Laganier,Victoria Nockles,Richard Walters*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper presents a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models to solve the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem, a novel variant of multiple TSP. The model shows consistent performance close to the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic solver but runs significantly faster, enhancing resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems often operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous environments, necessitating rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile or slow communication links to centralised compute. This requires fast, on-board replanning algorithms for enhanced resilience.

Method: The authors define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a novel variant of multiple Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs) and develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently.

Result: Using a simple example of cooperative drones, the replanner consistently (90% of the time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems by providing a faster and efficient solution for mission replanning.

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for
executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime
domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous
environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile
or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning
algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning
shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when
formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)
are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;
2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with
variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board
deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a
novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and
develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and
Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple
example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the
time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic
solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves
the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of geometric assembly by leveraging point-level affordance for bimanual collaboration, introducing a real-world benchmark to evaluate performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geometric assembly tasks, such as reconstructing shattered objects, are crucial robotic skills with real-world applications but remain challenging due to the need for recognizing geometric cues and executing complex manipulation.

Method: The authors exploit the geometric generalization of point-level affordance to learn bimanual collaboration in geometric assembly tasks. They also introduce a real-world benchmark to address evaluation ambiguity caused by the geometry diversity of broken parts.

Result: Extensive experiments show that their approach outperforms previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods in geometric assembly tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully leverages point-level affordance for bimanual geometric assembly and establishes a reproducible benchmark for evaluating such tasks.

Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a
crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various
assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into
their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly
challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,
assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied
fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of
point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in
geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the
evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce
a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both
previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces ScaleRTL, a reasoning LLM for RTL coding that overcomes data bottlenecks and supports test-time scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs have limited effectiveness in RTL code generation due to lack of high-quality training data and non-reasoning nature which restricts test-time scaling.

Method: Curated a large dataset of long chain-of-thought reasoning traces for RTL knowledge. Fine-tuned a general-purpose reasoning model on this dataset to create ScaleRTL. Enhanced ScaleRTL's performance with a novel test-time scaling strategy involving iterative reflection and self-correction.

Result: ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

Conclusion: ScaleRTL is the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that effectively scales high-quality reasoning data and test-time compute, significantly improving performance in RTL tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human
performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code
generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not
fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time
scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL,
the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality
reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of
long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in
a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a
general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable
of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of
ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning
process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning
steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by
up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to improve query performance and opens new directions for training-free, embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for
database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained

validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint
space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors conduct a systematic study of disaggregated inference in large-scale deployments. They evaluate many design points across various workloads and hardware configurations, revealing that disaggregation is particularly effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger models. Key to achieving optimal performance are dynamic rate matching and elastic scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to explore the practicality and benefits of disaggregated inference in multi-node deployments, given its potential to enhance the trade-off between throughput and interactivity in machine learning systems.

Method: The researchers conducted an extensive evaluation of hundreds of thousands of design points under diverse workloads and hardware setups. This allowed them to systematically analyze the effectiveness of disaggregated inference.

Result: They found that disaggregation significantly improves performance for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger models. Additionally, dynamic rate matching and elastic scaling play crucial roles in reaching Pareto-optimal performance.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable guidance for implementing efficient disaggregated serving strategies, helping to balance system throughput with interactivity.

Abstract: As inference scales to multi-node deployments, disaggregation - splitting
inference into distinct phases - offers a promising path to improving the
throughput-interactivity Pareto frontier. Despite growing enthusiasm and a
surge of open-source efforts, practical deployment of disaggregated serving
remains limited due to the complexity of the optimization search space and
system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of disaggregated inference at scale, evaluating hundreds of thousands of design
points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. We find that
disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the
trade-off between system throughput and interactivity.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于相似性匹配网络的连续时间神经网络模型，用于主子空间投影，并通过多级优化框架证明了其离线设置下的收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于相似性匹配成本函数和低秩矩阵近似问题的降维框架在生物学上有明确的解释并已成功应用于多个领域，但其完整的收敛性分析尚未完善。

Method: 研究构建了一个连续时间神经网络——相似性匹配网络，该网络由三个在不同时间尺度上耦合的动力学组成：快速时间尺度上的神经动力学、中间时间尺度上的横向突触动力学以及慢速时间尺度上的前馈突触动力学。分别使用Hebbian和反Hebbian学习规则来处理前馈和横向突触动力学。利用多级优化框架，在离线设置下证明了这些动力学的收敛性。

Result: 在第一级（快速时间尺度）上，展示了成本函数的强凸性及其对应的梯度流动力学的全局指数收敛性；第二级（中间时间尺度）上，证明了成本函数的强凹性和对应梯度流动力学在正定矩阵空间内的指数收敛性；第三级（慢速时间尺度）上，研究了非凸且非光滑的成本函数，提供了其全局最小值的显式表达式，并证明了相应梯度流动力学几乎必然收敛到全局最小值。

Conclusion: 通过一个多级优化框架，本研究成功证明了相似性匹配网络在离线设置下的收敛性，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in biologically-plausible normative frameworks for
dimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function
and the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological
interpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental
validation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on
this framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the
\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived
from a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of
three coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,
lateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,
intermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral
synaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,
respectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove
convergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first
level (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and
global exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At
the second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the
cost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow
dynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final
level (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,
provide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure
convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.
These results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported
by thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our approach via a numerical example.

Motivation: To discover new exoplanets and detect variable stars, particularly short-period eclipsing binaries which are valuable for studying stellar formation and evolution.

Method: Surveyed TESS Full-Frame Image data using a neural network to identify stars with eclipse-like features, followed by an in-depth automated analysis and manual inspection of selected targets.

Result: A catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and validated eclipsing binary stars was created, consisting of 7936 newly discovered systems and updates for 2065 known ones. Additionally, ~900,000 unvetted/unvalidated targets were provided for further study.

Conclusion: This work significantly contributes to the understanding of eclipsing binary systems and provides a rich resource for future investigations into stellar astrophysics.

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the
entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30

goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting

relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful
astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and
evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for
eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million
stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth
analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by
citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and

Abstract: Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world
data science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine
learning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost
all physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks
that often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general
problem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we
address the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with
the discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant
vulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we
dubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally
illustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle
suppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of
parameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data
processing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting
for invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish
between continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with
regression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings
align with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and
to a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for
inversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding
perceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation
objective. It is our hope that this paper will provide practitioners with
deeper insights that may be leveraged in the future for the development of more
efficient and informed strategic system planning, critical in safety-sensitive
applications.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces PnP, an optimization-free watermark forgery method using regenerative diffusion models, which can successfully forge watermarks with high detectability while maintaining visual quality, posing a significant challenge to current watermarking techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal a greater risk in watermark forgery by developing a method that does not require optimization or knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes, thus broadening the scope of forgery attacks.

Method: PnP (Plug-and-Plant) extracts and integrates target watermarks via image regeneration using existing regenerative diffusion models, utilizing watermarked latent from the target image and visual-textual context of cover images as priors without additional optimization.

Result: PnP successfully forges watermarks with up to 100% detectability and good user attribution while maintaining the best visual perception across 24 scenarios of model-data-watermark combinations.

Conclusion: PnP significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks, bypassing model retraining and being adaptable to any image, challenging the security of current watermarking techniques and the authority of watermarking schemes.

Abstract: Watermarking becomes one of the pivotal solutions to trace and verify the
origin of synthetic images generated by artificial intelligence models, but it
is not free of risks. Recent studies demonstrate the capability to forge
watermarks from a target image onto cover images via adversarial optimization
without knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes. In this
paper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal
watermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models. Our
proposed forgery attack, PnP (Plug-and-Plant), seamlessly extracts and
integrates the target watermark via regenerating the image, without needing any
additional optimization routine. It allows for universal watermark forgery that
works independently of the target image's origin or the watermarking model
used. We explore the watermarked latent extracted from the target image and
visual-textual context of cover images as priors to guide sampling of the
regenerative process. Extensive evaluation on 24 scenarios of
model-data-watermark combinations demonstrates that PnP can successfully forge
the watermark (up to 100% detectability and user attribution), and maintain the
best visual perception. By bypassing model retraining and enabling adaptability
to any image, our approach significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks,
presenting a greater challenge to the security of current watermarking
techniques for diffusion models and the authority of watermarking schemes in

Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic
manipulated video and audio. This progress presents a significant security and
ethical threat, as malicious users can exploit DeepFake techniques to spread
misinformation. Recent DeepFake detection approaches explore the multimodal
(audio-video) threat scenario. In particular, there is a lack of
reproducibility and critical issues with existing datasets - such as the
recently uncovered silence shortcut in the widely used FakeAVCeleb dataset.
Considering the importance of this topic, we aim to gain a deeper understanding
of the key issues affecting benchmarking in audio-video DeepFake detection. We
examine these challenges through the lens of the three core benchmarking
pillars: datasets, detection methods, and evaluation protocols. To address
these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to
propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce
SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach
that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights
into the issue of audio shortcuts and present a promising mitigation strategy.
Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used
FakeAVCeleb dataset. Our findings offer a way forward in the complex area of
audio-video DeepFake detection.

*Anarya Ray*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: Normalizing flows can emulate binary parameter distribution functions for gravitational wave observations, guiding population models and data amplification. Uncertainties are addressed via Bayesian Normalizing flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences are crucial for extracting astrophysical insights from gravitational wave observations, but realistic simulations are costly.

Method: The author develops a Bayesian Normalizing flow method using conditional density estimators constructed from Bayesian neural networks to quantify and marginalize uncertainties in emulators.

Result: The method demonstrates accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification impacts for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution.

Conclusion: This methodology has applications in simulation-based inference from growing gravitational wave catalogs and other uses for general simulation-based approaches in gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a
crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of
gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly
to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can
emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary
parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical
initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given
data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data
amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the
development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable
systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a
prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with
uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a
method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by
introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator
constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function
associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow
parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow
uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification
impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole
populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of
the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and
sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: To tackle the low performance in uncommon human-centric domains due to lack of input data, this paper introduces Gen4D, an automated pipeline for generating diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Also, SportPAL, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning three sports is presented.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities leads to low performance across various computer vision tasks, especially in uncommon human-centric domains like sports.

Method: The method involves introducing Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline that integrates expert-driven motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian splatting, and human-aware background synthesis. Based on Gen4D, SportPAL, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning three sports is created.

Result: Gen4D can generate diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. SportPAL provides a scalable foundation for constructing synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks without manual 3D modeling or scene design.

Conclusion: Gen4D and SportPAL together provide a scalable solution to the challenge of limited data in uncommon human-centric domains.

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low
performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets
offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from
limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to
their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and
lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale
synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer.
Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing
synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no
need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.

*Daniel Wang,Patrick Rim,Tian Tian,Alex Wong,Ganesh Sundaramoorthi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: An abstract about a new method called ODE-GS that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for predicting dynamic 3D scenes beyond training time span.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural rendering systems fail to predict the future as they embed time directly in a deformation network, leading to collapse when timestamps are out-of-distribution.

Method: ODE-GS learns a high-fidelity, time-conditioned deformation model for the training window and then trains a Transformer encoder summarizing past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state governed by a neural ODE.

Result: ODE-GS achieves state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) compared to strongest baselines.

Conclusion: Continuous-time latent dynamics offer a powerful and practical approach for photorealistic prediction of complex 3D scenes.

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: The paper presents DART-Vetter, a Convolutional Neural Network designed to distinguish planetary candidates from false positives using light curves data from transit surveys like TESS and Kepler. It achieves competitive performance with a recall rate of 91% on combined TESS and Kepler data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the robustness of Deep Learning models in identifying planetary candidates by utilizing data complementarity from various transit surveys.

Method: Development of a Convolutional Neural Network named DART-Vetter that processes folded light curves to differentiate planetary candidates from false positives.

Result: DART-Vetter demonstrates competitive triaging performance with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and Kepler data, showing good generalization for specific TCEs.

Conclusion: DART-Vetter is a compact, open-source tool that can automate triaging procedures or assist human vetters effectively.

Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the
employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently
analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further
improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the
complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's
Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future,
the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this
work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish
planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any
potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that
processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,
featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other
triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and
tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously
labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of
our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive
triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and
Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open
source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly
useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters,
showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) >
20 and orbital period < 50 days.

*Yinchao Zhang,Su Yao,Yong Feng,Kang Chen,Tong Li,Zhuotao Liu,Yi Zhao,Lexuan Zhang,Xiangyu Gao,Feng Xiong,Qi Li,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Pegasus is proposed to overcome the limitations of current use of match-action table abstraction in Intelligent DataPlane by translating deep learning operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives: Partition, Map, and SumReduce. It also employs Primitive Fusion and uses full precision weights with fixed-point activations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current use of match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the dataplane for deep learning inference, which includes accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality.

Method: Pegasus translates DL operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives: Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Partition divides high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors; Map conquers computations on the low-dimensional vectors in parallel using fuzzy matching; SumReduce combines the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs Primitive Fusion to merge computations and adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations.

Result: Pegasus can effectively support various types of DL models on the dataplane, including MLP, RNN, CNN, and AutoEncoder models. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to 22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

Conclusion: Pegasus successfully addresses the limitations of current use of MAT abstraction for DL inference on the dataplane, providing a more general, scalable, and accurate solution.

Abstract: The paradigm of Intelligent DataPlane (IDP) embeds deep learning (DL) models
on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed.
However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the
dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations,
including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This
paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL
operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality:
Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides"
high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them
more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the
low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while
SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs
Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus
adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.
Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively
support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and
AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to
22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

### [329] [Adaptive stable distribution and Hurst exponent by method of moments moving estimator for nonstationary time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05354)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: This paper introduces a moving estimator method for adapting models to nonstationary real-life time series, focusing on applications for alpha-Stable distribution and adaptive estimation of Hurst exponent. It demonstrates the method's application on financial data (DJIA time series) to continuously evaluate market stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-life time series are nonstationary, requiring model adaptation. Classical approaches assume arbitrary dependence types which may introduce bias.

Method: The paper proposes a moving estimator method that estimates parameters separately for every time point by optimizing local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of old values. This is achieved through Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of some parameters, such as absolute central moments.

Result: The method was applied to DJIA financial time series, estimating not only the evolution of center and scale parameters but also the alpha parameter, allowing continuous evaluation of market stability and probability of extreme events.

Conclusion: The moving estimator approach provides an agnostic way to adapt models to nonstationary time series, offering insights into market stability via the alpha parameter.

Abstract: Nonstationarity of real-life time series requires model adaptation. In
classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH there is assumed some arbitrarily chosen
dependence type. To avoid their bias, we will focus on novel more agnostic
approach: moving estimator, which estimates parameters separately for every
time $t$: optimizing $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta
(x_\tau))$ local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of the old
values. In practice such moving estimates can be found by EMA (exponential
moving average) of some parameters, like $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ absolute central
moments, updated by $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. We
will focus here on its applications for alpha-Stable distribution, which also
influences Hurst exponent, hence can be used for its adaptive estimation. Its
application will be shown on financial data as DJIA time series - beside
standard estimation of evolution of center $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$,
there is also estimated evolution of $\alpha$ parameter allowing to
continuously evaluate market stability - tails having $\rho(x) \sim
1/|x|^{\alpha+1}$ behavior, controlling probability of potentially dangerous
extreme events.

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The {fairmetrics} R package provides a framework for evaluating group-based fairness criteria in ML models, offering point and interval estimates for multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of systematically biased outcomes in ML models for specific groups defined by protected attributes.

Method: Providing both point and interval estimates for numerous group-based fairness criteria, including independence, separation, and sufficiency, using a convenient wrapper function.

Result: Users can rigorously evaluate ML model fairness and implement appropriate bias mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: The {fairmetrics} R package is a valuable tool for ensuring ML models do not perpetuate structural inequalities.

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring
models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups,
particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or
age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as
biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R
package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous
group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g.,
statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g.,
predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is
equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that
appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics}
provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a
convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database
(Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Embodied AI systems face safety challenges in complex environments, hindering large-scale deployment. While deterministic safety is ideal, it's impractical for scalable systems. This paper introduces provable probabilistic safety, ensuring residual risk remains below a threshold, enhancing feasibility and scalability through statistical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safer, large-scale deployment of embodied AI systems in safety-critical domains by addressing the impracticality of achieving deterministic safety due to the rarity and complexity of corner cases.

Method: Introduce the concept of provable probabilistic safety, which establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on system performance using statistical methods, focusing on three core questions: definition, proof, and achievement of probabilistic safety.

Result: Provides a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems by bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment.

Conclusion: Provable probabilistic safety offers a feasible approach to enhance the safety of embodied AI systems, enabling their deployment in safety-critical applications while allowing for continuous refinement of safety guarantees.

Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are
increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system
failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a
major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in
safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and
robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system
safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity
and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable
embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable
probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of
large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of
attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm
establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance,
leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A
well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be
deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety
guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable
probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve
the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical
safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward
safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着淡水资源的需求不断增加，水资源的再利用和清洁水回归自然环境变得越来越重要。然而，废水处理厂虽然生成了大量历史数据，但这些数据中嵌入的信息往往难以被管理者有效整合和理解。因此，需要一种方法来帮助管理者快速掌握废水处理厂的运行状态。

Result: 该方法成功地将大量的历史数据简化为几个可解释的操作模式，清晰地展示了每个模式下的相关变量和设施单元，从而提高了管理者对废水处理厂整体运行的理解和掌控能力。

Conclusion: 基于XAI的方法可以有效地从复杂的废水处理厂数据中提取可解释的服务知识，帮助管理者更好地理解工厂的运行模式，为优化废水处理厂的运营提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater
demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return
of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore,
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on
these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve
their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases
of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a
large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant
managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to
know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the
intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that
need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable
and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is
proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service
knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which
is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council
of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of
XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize
a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes
of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and
facility units involved in each case.
