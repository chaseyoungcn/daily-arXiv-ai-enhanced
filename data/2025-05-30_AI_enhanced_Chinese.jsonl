This\nparadigm involves deploying a model provided by a third party on local devices\nto perform inference tasks. However, it exposes the private model to two\nprimary security threats: model stealing (MS) and membership inference attacks\n(MIA). To mitigate these risks, existing wisdom deploys models within Trusted\nExecution Environments (TEEs), which is a secure isolated execution space.\nNonetheless, the constrained secure memory capacity in TEEs makes it\nchallenging to achieve full model security with low inference latency. This\npaper fills the gap with TensorShield, the first efficient on-device inference\nwork that shields partial tensors of the model while still fully defending\nagainst MS and MIA. The key enabling techniques in TensorShield include: (i) a\nnovel eXplainable AI (XAI) technique exploits the model's attention transition\nto assess critical tensors and shields them in TEE to achieve secure inference,\nand (ii) two meticulous designs with critical feature identification and\nlatency-aware placement to accelerate inference while maintaining security.\nExtensive evaluations show that TensorShield delivers almost the same security\nprotection as shielding the entire model inside TEE, while being up to\n25.35$\\times$ (avg. 5.85$\\times$) faster than the state-of-the-art work,\nwithout accuracy loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "TensorShield is an efficient on-device inference method that partially shields model tensors to defend against model stealing and membership inference attacks while maintaining low latency and accuracy.", "motivation": "On-device inference has become crucial for safeguarding user data privacy on mobile and IoT devices, but existing methods using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) face challenges with secure memory capacity and inference latency.", "method": "TensorShield uses a novel eXplainable AI (XAI) technique to assess critical tensors and shield them in TEEs.

Our custom\nattention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial\ncompression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer\ncontext length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to\ndense inference.

In artificial neural networks, this\nis typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by\ninjecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters\nthemselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as\nserotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn\nweights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.\nRather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we\noptimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To\naccomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as\nthe minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric\nmovement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects\na single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for\na particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.\nFirst, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a\nconvenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.\nSecond, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging\ngeneralization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several\ntopologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.\nnoise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their\nsimplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks\nby input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.\nThese results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds\noffers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d7\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5927\u8111\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u53c2\u6570\u672c\u8eab\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u5404\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u5242\uff08\u5982\u8840\u6e05\u7d20\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7075\u611f\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5b66\u4e60\u6743\u91cd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u6743\u91cd\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u662f\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u786e\u5b9a\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u76f4\u7ebf\u3001\u692d\u5706\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u8fde\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6837\u672c\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c03\u5236\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65b9\u4fbf\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

While AI methods like AlphaFold\ncan predict accurate structural models for many protein complexes, reliably\nestimating the quality of these predicted models (estimation of model accuracy,\nor EMA) for model ranking and selection remains a major challenge. A key\nbarrier to developing effective machine learning-based EMA methods is the lack\nof large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets for training and evaluation. To\naddress this gap, we introduce PSBench, a benchmark suite comprising four\nlarge-scale, labeled datasets generated during the 15th and 16th community-wide\nCritical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15 and CASP16).\nPSBench includes over one million structural models covering a wide range of\nprotein sequence lengths, complex stoichiometries, functional classes, and\nmodeling difficulties. Each model is annotated with multiple complementary\nquality scores at the global, local, and interface levels. PSBench also\nprovides multiple evaluation metrics and baseline EMA methods to facilitate\nrigorous comparisons. To demonstrate PSBench's utility, we trained and\nevaluated GATE, a graph transformer-based EMA method, on the CASP15 data. GATE\nwas blindly tested in CASP16 (2024), where it ranked among the top-performing\nEMA methods.

However, the extent to which this ability\ngeneralizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains\nunclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in\nLLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be\nrecalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset\nof 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English\noriginals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new\ntranslations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,\nMalagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families\nand sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to\nidentify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting\nmasked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating\ncontinuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,\neven for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for\nexample, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%\nof the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking\ncharacters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop\nfor shuffled official translations).

As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and\nare deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend\nnegation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual\nquestion answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions\ncovering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We\nconstruct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated\nversions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20\nstate-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models\nstruggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop\ncompared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover\na U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades\nperformance on NegVQA before leading to improvements.

This has motivated the\ndevelopment of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific\nknowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these\nadvancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a\nchallenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this\nwork, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning\nevaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and\nfive prompt-based auditing methods.

Through\nextensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully\ndesigned regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance\nbut also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their\noriginal performance.

During inference, this training scheme\nenables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying\nthem into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with\neach prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution\nand OOD inputs.

Existing methods typically employ\ndynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However,\ntheir reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture\nglobal contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent\ninternal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address\nthese limitations, we propose \\textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware,\ndynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical\nattention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global\ncontextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy.

However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those\nin psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with\nobjective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on\nsubjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment\nwith human preferences, for which strict \"correctness\" criteria are\nill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce\nmisaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS\nframework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation\nis \"domain alignment\", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined\nend-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain\nprinciples (e.g., empathy in counseling).

GRPO, which uses reinforcement learning with execution feedback, significantly improves both the pass rate and efficiency of the generated code.", "motivation": "The motivation is to improve the code efficiency of Large Language Models' outputs since functional correctness alone is insufficient for real-world deployment.", "method": "The method involves introducing a novel test-time iterative optimization framework that employs a closed-loop system. In this system, LLMs iteratively refine code based on empirical performance feedback from an execution sandbox. The study explores three training strategies: SFT, DPO, and GRPO.", "result": "Experiments show that SFT and DPO quickly reach a plateau in efficiency gains. However, GRPO continuously optimizes code performance, leading to significant improvements in both pass@1 rates (from 47% to 62%) and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in terms of efficiency (from 31% to 45%).", "conclusion": "This work successfully demonstrates effective improvements in test-time code efficiency and highlights the potential of reinforcement learning in enabling LLMs to self-improve their code efficiency."}}

We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform\nAutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor\nDoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems.

For\nexample, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be\nboth surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper\ncrafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical\nfor a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion\nfor Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the\nnew task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with\natypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts\natypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their\nuser-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to\nrerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system\ndevelopment and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are\nmanually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially\ngenerated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect\nutility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic\nselection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based\njudgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that\nserendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with\nground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual\nannotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we\nhope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in\nthis paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go\nbeyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.\n  The datasets and the code are made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/ramituncc49er/ATARS .", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u8350\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5178\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u5916\u60ca\u559c\uff08serendipity\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u624b\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7528\u6237\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u610f\u5916\u60ca\u559c\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6392\u540d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u987e\u5ba2\u5728\u9910\u5385\u6216\u9152\u5e97\u9047\u5230\u4e0e\u81ea\u5df1\u5174\u8da3\u76f8\u7b26\u7684\u975e\u5178\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u96be\u5fd8\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u559c\u6b22\u6298\u7eb8\u7684\u987e\u5ba2\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u88ab\u9910\u5385\u7b49\u5019\u533a\u7684\u6298\u7eb8\u5236\u4f5c\u7ad9\u6240\u5438\u5f15\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u5df4\u6d1b\u514b\u97f3\u4e50\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u5ba2\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bf9\u9152\u5e97\u5927\u5802\u5c55\u793a\u768418\u4e16\u7eaa\u5927\u952e\u7434\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u8350\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5178\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u5916\u60ca\u559c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u9053\u4ece\u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u975e\u5178\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6548\u7528\u503c\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u610f\u5916\u60ca\u559c\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b3) \u6839\u636e\u610f\u5916\u60ca\u559c\u6f5c\u529b\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u63a8\u8350\u5217\u8868\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5bf9\u975e\u5178\u578b\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7528\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff1b5) \u5229\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u624b\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684Yelp\u8bc4\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7528\u6237\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u5916\u60ca\u559c\u7684\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u624b\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6392\u540d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8d85\u8d8a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While\nthere is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence\nfor average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding\ntools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the\nclassical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness\nof inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree\npolynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.\n  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree\nhardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for\nlearning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it\nto prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a\nchallenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To\nour knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework\nwas open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree\nhardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with\nsingle-qubit measurements.\n  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and\nidentify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for\nprotocols that perform local measurements.

While\nsmaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational\ncost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches\nprimarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is\nexpensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating\nmultiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.\nAlthough effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly\nscoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time\nScaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an\nevolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and\nmutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring\nregions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To\nreduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model\nto self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL).

Additionally,\noff-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose\ngeometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput\ngeneration of novel proteins with functionality comparable to natural proteins,\nwhile achieving a high success rate in designing multifunctional proteins.

Notably,\nwhile humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions\nproactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind\n(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader\n(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by\nincorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness\nand analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by\nprompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central\nclaim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to\npredict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully\ndesigned reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to\nanalyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective\narguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B\nparameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative\ngain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,\nToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,\nwhich leads to more diverse and effective arguments.

We theoretically motivate the efficiency of JAPAN and empirically\nvalidate it across multivariate regression and forecasting tasks, demonstrating\ngood calibration and tighter prediction areas compared to existing baselines.\nWe also provide several \\emph{extensions} adding flexibility to our proposed\nframework.", "AI": {"tldr": "JAPAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86JAPAN\uff08\u8054\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0cJAPAN\u4f30\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u9608\u503c\u5904\u7406\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u76f8\u8fde\u7684\u3001\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86JAPAN\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "JAPAN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b26\u5408\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

As\nthese LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,\nwhether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination\nin fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1\nreports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while\nOpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally\nraises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to\nhallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)\nWe first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our\nanalysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold\nstart supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate\ntheir hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training\nwithout cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To\nexplore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on\nhallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two\ncritical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw\nRepetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the\nsame underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer\nfails to faithfully match the previous CoT process.

Linear attention methods are efficient\nalternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of\nsoftmax attention.

LoLA separately stores\nadditional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative\nmemories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models\nand transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of\nmemory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize\npairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent\nhidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables\npass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks\nfrom RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to\n97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1\n8B.

Our\nexperimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff08GD\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Muon\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u56e0\u80fd\u5229\u7528Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1Muons\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u6536\u655b\u7279\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6240\u5728\u53ca\u9002\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86Muon\u4f18\u4e8eGD\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cMuon\u53ef\u4ee5\u4eceHessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u53c2\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}
