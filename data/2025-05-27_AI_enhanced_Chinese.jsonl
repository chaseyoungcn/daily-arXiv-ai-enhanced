Overrefusal typically stems from\nover-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable\nprompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe\nand leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate\noverrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to\nmisalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish\nsubtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these\ninsights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and\nselection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety\nboundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS\nefficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more\neffective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only\nprovides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but\nalso seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety\ndecision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set\nto facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple\nlanguages.

While demonstrably malicious, the immediate\nreal-world impact of such prediction-altering attacks has remained unclear. In\nthis paper we introduce a novel and significantly more potent class of\nbackdoors that builds upon recent advancements in architectural backdoors. We\ndemonstrate how these backdoors can be specifically engineered to exploit\nbatched inference, a common technique for hardware utilization, enabling\nlarge-scale user data manipulation and theft. By targeting the batching\nprocess, these architectural backdoors facilitate information leakage between\nconcurrent user requests and allow attackers to fully control model responses\ndirected at other users within the same batch. In other words, an attacker who\ncan change the model architecture can set and steal model inputs and outputs of\nother users within the same batch. We show that such attacks are not only\nfeasible but also alarmingly effective, can be readily injected into prevalent\nmodel architectures, and represent a truly malicious threat to user privacy and\nsystem integrity. Critically, to counteract this new class of vulnerabilities,\nwe propose a deterministic mitigation strategy that provides formal guarantees\nagainst this new attack vector, unlike prior work that relied on Large Language\nModels to find the backdoors. Our mitigation strategy employs a novel\nInformation Flow Control mechanism that analyzes the model graph and proves\nnon-interference between different user inputs within the same batch. Using our\nmitigation strategy we perform a large scale analysis of models hosted through\nHugging Face and find over 200 models that introduce (unintended) information\nleakage between batch entries due to the use of dynamic quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u540e\u95e8\u8fd1\u5341\u5e74\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u7a83\u53d6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u6279\u91cf\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u67b6\u6784\u540e\u95e8\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba9\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u63a7\u5236\u540c\u4e00\u6279\u6b21\u4e2d\u5176\u4ed6\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u5e72\u6270\u6027\u3002\u5728Hugging Face\u6258\u7ba1\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7200\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e4b\u524d\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6076\u610f\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u6539\u53d8\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5177\u5b9e\u9645\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u65b0\u540e\u95e8\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u7a83\u53d6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u4e00\u6279\u6b21\u5185\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0e\u7a83\u53d6\u3002\n2. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\uff08Information Flow Control\uff09\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u95f4\u65e0\u5e72\u6270\u3002\n3. \u5bf9Hugging Face\u6258\u7ba1\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "1. \u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u8f7b\u6613\u6ce8\u5165\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002\n2. \u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7200\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u540e\u95e8\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6784\u6210\u91cd\u5927\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6279\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u9632\u62a4\u3002"}}

However,\ntheir tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their\nreliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and\ntrustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and\nmitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking\nthe potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we\nadvance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea\nis to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to\ncustomize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner,\nsupporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we\ndesign a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime\nverification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific\nconstraints defined in ESL.

Recent studies suggest\nthat LLMs exhibit sparsity, which can be used for pruning. Previous pruning\nmethods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned parts\nstill contain valuable information, statically removing them without updating\nthe remaining parameters often results in irreversible performance degradation,\nrequiring costly recovery fine-tuning (RFT) to maintain performance. To address\nthis, we propose a novel paradigm: first apply regularization, then prune.\nBased on this paradigm, we propose ELDeR: Getting Efficient LLMs through\nData-Driven Regularized Layer-wise Pruning. We multiply the output of each\ntransformer layer by an initial weight, then we iteratively learn the weights\nof each transformer layer by using a small amount of data in a simple way.\nAfter that, we apply regularization to the difference between the output and\ninput of the layers with smaller weights, forcing the information to be\ntransferred to the remaining layers. Compared with direct pruning, ELDeR\nreduces the information loss caused by direct parameter removal, thus better\npreserving the model's language modeling ability. Experimental results show\nthat ELDeR achieves superior performance compared with powerful layer-wise\nstructured pruning methods, while greatly reducing RFT computational costs.\nSince ELDeR is a layer-wise pruning method, its end-to-end acceleration effect\nis obvious, making it a promising technique for efficient LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ELDeR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9010\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u5fae\u8c03\uff08RFT\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5148\u526a\u679d\u540e\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u5730\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6062\u590d\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5148\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u540e\u526a\u679d\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ELDeR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2aTransformer\u5c42\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e58\u4ee5\u4e00\u4e2a\u521d\u59cb\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u63a5\u7740\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5c42\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u65bd\u52a0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5269\u4f59\u5c42\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u76f4\u63a5\u53c2\u6570\u79fb\u9664\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cELDeR\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eRFT\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9010\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u662f\u9010\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "ELDeR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684LLMs\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u9ad8\u6548LLMs\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We ask: Can deception be intercepted while the model is\nthinking? We answer this question, the first framework that embeds a\nSelf-Monitor inside the CoT process itself, named CoT Monitor+. During\ngeneration, the model produces (i) ordinary reasoning steps and (ii) an\ninternal self-evaluation signal trained to flag and suppress misaligned\nstrategies. The signal is used as an auxiliary reward in reinforcement\nlearning, creating a feedback loop that rewards honest reasoning and\ndiscourages hidden goals. To study deceptive alignment systematically, we\nintroduce DeceptionBench, a five-category benchmark that probes covert\nalignment-faking, sycophancy, etc. We evaluate various LLMs and show that\nunrestricted CoT roughly aggravates the deceptive tendency. In contrast, CoT\nMonitor+ cuts deceptive behaviors by 43.8% on average while preserving task\naccuracy. Further, when the self-monitor signal replaces an external weak judge\nin RL fine-tuning, models exhibit substantially fewer obfuscated thoughts and\nretain transparency.

Our main conceptual contribution is a novel guidance method,\nwhere guidance (which is a function of $w$) comes from the same diffusion\nmodel, therefore, our proposal is termed Self-Weighted Guidance (SWG).

However, they\noften struggle to balance efficiency and effectiveness, frequently generating\nunnecessarily lengthy reasoning chains for simple problems. In this work, we\npropose AdaCtrl, a novel framework to support both difficulty-aware adaptive\nreasoning budget allocation and explicit user control over reasoning depth.\nAdaCtrl dynamically adjusts its reasoning length based on self-assessed problem\ndifficulty, while also allowing users to manually control the budget to\nprioritize either efficiency or effectiveness. This is achieved through a\ntwo-stage training pipeline: an initial cold-start fine-tuning phase to instill\nthe ability to self-aware difficulty and adjust reasoning budget, followed by a\ndifficulty-aware reinforcement learning (RL) stage that refines the model's\nadaptive reasoning strategies and calibrates its difficulty assessments based\non its evolving capabilities during online training.

Rather than attributing unpredictability to intrinsic randomness or\nemergent nonlinearity, ULP asserts that every analyzable system is governed by\na structurally unique, deterministic generative mechanism, one that remains\nhidden not due to ontological indeterminacy, but due to epistemic constraints.\nThe theory is formalized using a non-universal generative mapping \\(\n\\mathcal{F}_S(P_S, t) \\), where each system \\( S \\) possesses its own latent\nstructure \\( P_S \\), irreducible and non-replicable across systems. Observed\nirregularities are modeled as projections of this generative map through\nobserver-limited interfaces, introducing epistemic noise \\( \\varepsilon_S(t) \\)\nas a measure of incomplete access. By shifting the locus of uncertainty from\nthe system to the observer, ULP reframes chaos as a context-relative failure of\nrepresentation. We contrast this position with foundational paradigms in chaos\ntheory, complexity science, and statistical learning. While they assume or\nmodel shared randomness or collective emergence, ULP maintains that every\ninstance harbors a singular structural identity. Although conceptual, the\ntheory satisfies the criterion of falsifiability in the Popperian sense, it\ninvites empirical challenge by asserting that no two systems governed by\ndistinct latent mechanisms will remain indistinguishable under sufficient\nresolution.

Deep learning is currently the predominant approach for\nencrypted traffic classification through feature analysis. However, these\nmethods face limitations due to their high dependence on labeled data and\ndifficulties in detecting attack variants. First, their performance is highly\nsensitive to data quality, where the highcost manual labeling process and\ndataset imbalance significantly degrade results. Second, the rapid evolution of\nattack patterns makes it challenging for models to identify new types of\nattacks. To tackle these challenges, we present GBC, a generative model based\non pre-training for encrypted traffic comprehension. Since traditional\ntokenization methods are primarily designed for natural language, we propose a\nprotocol-aware tokenization approach for encrypted traffic that improves model\ncomprehension of fields specific to network traffic. In addition, GBC employs\npretraining to learn general representations from extensive unlabeled traffic\ndata.

In many\nscenarios, e.g., mobile networks or static deployments distributed over a large\ngeographical area, it is often desired to detect jamming at the early stage,\nwhen it affects the communication link enough to be detected but not\nsufficiently to disrupt it (detection of weak jamming signals). Under such\nassumptions, devices can enhance situational awareness and promptly apply\nmitigation, e.g., moving away from the jammed area in mobile scenarios or\nchanging communication frequency in static deployments, before jamming fully\ndisrupts the communication link. Although some contributions recently\ndemonstrated the feasibility of detecting low-power and weak jamming signals,\nthey make simplistic assumptions far from real-world deployments. Given the\ncurrent state of the art, no evidence exists that detection of weak jamming can\nbe considered with real-world communication technologies. In this paper, we\nprovide and comprehensively analyze new general-purpose strategies for\ndetecting weak jamming signals, compatible by design with one of the most\nrelevant communication technologies used by commercial-off-the-shelf devices,\ni.e., IEEE 802.11. We describe two operational modes: (i) binary classification\nvia Convolutional Neural Networks and (ii) one-class classification via Sparse\nAutoencoders. We evaluate and compare the proposed approaches with the current\nstate-of-the-art using data collected through an extensive real-world\nexperimental campaign in three relevant environments.

While\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious\nalternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to\narchitectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose\nUniversal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and\nplug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it\nwith specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the\nreward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using\npredefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into\ntoken-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at\ninference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone.\nThis additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR\nmodules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their\nlogits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on\nmathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR\nsignificantly outperforms \\add{existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the\nLlama3.2 model}. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong\ngeneralization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide\nmuch larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust\nsolution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core\ncapabilities.

To handle this study at the GitHub scale, we developed an\nautomated pipeline that scans GitHub for the targeted vulnerable pattern,\nconfirms the vulnerability by first running a static analysis and then\nexploiting the vulnerability in the context of the studied project, assesses\nits impact by calculating the CVSS score, generates a patch using GPT-4, and\nreports the vulnerability to the maintainers.\n  Using our pipeline, we identified 1,756 vulnerable open-source projects, some\nof which are very influential. For many of the affected projects, the\nvulnerability is critical (CVSS score higher than 9.0), as it can be exploited\nremotely without any privileges and critically impact the confidentiality and\navailability of the system. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to\nthe maintainers, and 14\\% of the reported vulnerabilities have been remediated.\n  We also investigated the root causes of the vulnerable code pattern and\nassessed the side effects of the large number of copies of this vulnerable\npattern that seem to have poisoned several popular LLMs. Our study highlights\nthe urgent need to help secure the open-source ecosystem by leveraging scalable\nautomated vulnerability management solutions and raising awareness among\ndevelopers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728GitHub\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u786e\u8ba4\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8def\u5f84\u904d\u5386\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08CWE-22\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u53d1\u73b0\u4e861,756\u4e2a\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5e76\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u5411\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d14%\u5df2\u88ab\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u52a0\u5f3a\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7ecf\u5e38\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb8\u591a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u5bf9\u624b\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u6269\u5c55\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u4e86\u89e3\u7279\u5b9a\u6613\u53d7\u8def\u5f84\u904d\u5386\u653b\u51fb\uff08CWE-22\uff09\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u5f00\u6e90GitHub\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\n1. \u5728GitHub\u4e0a\u626b\u63cf\u76ee\u6807\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\n2. \u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u786e\u8ba4\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\n3. \u5728\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u6027\u3002\n4. \u8ba1\u7b97CVSS\u5206\u6570\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n5. \u4f7f\u7528GPT-4\u751f\u6210\u8865\u4e01\u3002\n6. \u5411\u9879\u76ee\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa1,756\u4e2a\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6027\u7684\uff08CVSS\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u4e8e9.0\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5229\u7528\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u7279\u6743\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u5df2\u5411\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u62ab\u9732\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d14%\u5df2\u88ab\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u8def\u5f84\u904d\u5386\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5e2e\u52a9\u4fdd\u62a4\u5f00\u6e90\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u3002"}}

Existing\nmethods typically rely on fine-tuning with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)\ndata. However, these methods face significant practical limitations due to (1)\nthe difficulty of obtaining high-quality CoT data in recommendation and (2) the\nhigh inference latency caused by generating CoT reasoning. In this work, we\nexplore an alternative approach that shifts from explicit CoT reasoning to\ncompact, information-dense latent reasoning. This approach eliminates the need\nfor explicit CoT generation and improves inference efficiency, as a small set\nof latent tokens can effectively capture the entire reasoning process. Building\non this idea, we propose $\\textit{\\underline{R}einforced \\underline{Latent}\n\\underline{R}easoning for \\underline{R}ecommendation}$ (LatentR$^3$), a novel\nend-to-end training framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to\noptimize latent reasoning without relying on any CoT data.LatentR$^3$ adopts a\ntwo-stage training strategy: first, supervised fine-tuning to initialize the\nlatent reasoning module, followed by pure RL training to encourage exploration\nthrough a rule-based reward design. Our RL implementation is based on a\nmodified GRPO algorithm, which reduces computational overhead during training\nand introduces continuous reward signals for more efficient learning. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LatentR$^3$ enables effective latent reasoning\nwithout any direct supervision of the reasoning process, significantly\nimproving performance when integrated with different LLM-based recommendation\nmethods.

A new\ngeneration of location encoders have emerged with the goal of capturing\nattributes present at any given location for downstream use in predictive\nmodeling. Being a nascent area of research, their evaluation has remained\nlargely limited to static tasks such as species distributions or average\ntemperature mapping. In this paper, we discuss and quantify the impact of\nincorporating geolocation into deep learning for a real-world application\ndomain that is characteristically dynamic (with fast temporal change) and\nspatially heterogeneous at high resolutions: estimating surface-level daily\nPM2.5 levels using remotely sensed and ground-level data. We build on a\nrecently published deep learning-based PM2.5 estimation model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on data observed in the contiguous United States.\nWe examine three approaches for incorporating geolocation: excluding\ngeolocation as a baseline, using raw geographic coordinates, and leveraging\npretrained location encoders.

In-context learning (ICL), a recent paradigm\nwhere a few representative examples guide content generation has also led to\nstrong improvements in generation quality of LLM generated content. This idea\nhas been applied to great effect in synthetic tabular data generation, where\nLLMs, through effective use of ICL and prompt optimization, can generate data\nthat approximate samples from complex, heterogeneous distributions based on\nrepresentative examples. However, ensuring high-fidelity synthetic data often\nrequires a very large number of ICL examples which may be unavailable or costly\nto obtain. At the same time, as LLMs get larger and larger, their in-built\nprior knowledge becomes vast and can potentially substitute for specific data\nexamples. In this paper, we introduce Knowledge-Guided Prompting (KGP) as a new\nknob in prompt optimization and explore the ability of KGP-based prompt\noptimization to offset the cost of ICL.

This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging\nmultiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction.

The input predictions and the\nlearned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic\nprogram.

Through extensive experiments on a simulated\naerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we\ndemonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models\nand standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative\nimprovements of approximately 13.6% in F1-score and 16.6% in accuracy across 15\ndiverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model.

This inefficiency stems from the\nfact that training on simple questions yields limited gains, whereas more\nrollouts are needed for challenging questions to sample correct answers.\nFurthermore, while RL improves response precision, it limits the model's\nexploration ability, potentially resulting in a performance cap below that of\nthe base model prior to RL. To address these issues, we propose a mechanism for\ndynamically allocating rollout budgets based on the difficulty of the problems,\nenabling more efficient RL training.

Speculative decoding accelerates inference by\ngenerating multiple draft tokens using a lightweight model and verifying them\nin parallel. However, existing verification methods rely heavily on\ndistributional consistency while overlooking semantic correctness, thereby\nlimiting the potential speedup of speculative decoding. While some methods\nemploy additional models for relaxed verification of draft tokens, they often\nfail to generalize effectively to more diverse or open-domain settings. In this\nwork, we propose Reflective Verification, a training-free and semantics-aware\napproach that achieves a better trade-off between correctness and efficiency.\nSpecifically, we leverage the inherent reflective capacity of LLMs to\nsemantically assess the correctness of draft tokens in parallel during\nverification. Using prompt-based probing, we obtain both the original and\nreflective distributions of draft tokens in a single forward pass. The fusion\nof these distributions enables semantic-level verification of draft tokens that\nincorporates both consistency and correctness. Experiments across multiple\ndomain benchmarks and model scales demonstrate that our method significantly\nincreases the acceptance length of draft tokens without compromising model\nperformance.

To address this, we introduce BizFinBench, the first\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in real-world financial\napplications. BizFinBench consists of 6,781 well-annotated queries in Chinese,\nspanning five dimensions: numerical calculation, reasoning, information\nextraction, prediction recognition, and knowledge-based question answering,\ngrouped into nine fine-grained categories. The benchmark includes both\nobjective and subjective metrics. We also introduce IteraJudge, a novel LLM\nevaluation method that reduces bias when LLMs serve as evaluators in objective\nmetrics. We benchmark 25 models, including both proprietary and open-source\nsystems. Extensive experiments show that no model dominates across all tasks.\nOur evaluation reveals distinct capability patterns: (1) In Numerical\nCalculation, Claude-3.5-Sonnet (63.18) and DeepSeek-R1 (64.04) lead, while\nsmaller models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B (15.92) lag significantly; (2) In Reasoning,\nproprietary models dominate (ChatGPT-o3: 83.58, Gemini-2.0-Flash: 81.15), with\nopen-source models trailing by up to 19.49 points; (3) In Information\nExtraction, the performance spread is the largest, with DeepSeek-R1 scoring\n71.46, while Qwen3-1.7B scores 11.23; (4) In Prediction Recognition,\nperformance variance is minimal, with top models scoring between 39.16 and\n50.00. We find that while current LLMs handle routine finance queries\ncompetently, they struggle with complex scenarios requiring cross-concept\nreasoning.

Long reasoning traces significantly increase inference costs, and\nuniform-length solutions prevent base models from learning adaptive reasoning\nstrategies. To address these issues, we propose a difficulty-aware prompting\n(DAP) method to dynamically shorten reasoning traces without performance loss.\nIn our approach, a large teacher model first judges each problem's difficulty\nand then rewrites its reasoning traces to an appropriate shorter length,\nyielding concise yet complete reasoning traces. Leveraging the DAP pipeline, we\ncurate a distilled dataset called LiteCoT consisting of 100K concise reasoning\nexamples, with solutions averaging only 720 tokens (an order of magnitude\nshorter than typical CoTs). Using LiteCoT, we distilled a new family of\nreasoning models called Liter (1.5B, 7B, and 32B) based on the Qwen2.5\narchitecture. Experiments show that a student model fine-tuned on just 100K of\nthese difficulty-pruned CoT samples outperforms a model distilled on 800K\noriginal Long CoT samples, while significantly reducing training and inference\ncosts.

We evaluate more\nthan 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic\nhuman red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three\nstrong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack\nsuccess drops sharply once the target's capability exceeds the attacker's, and\n(iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science\nsplits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking\nscaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on\nattacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability\nattackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models,\nincreasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and\nmodel providers must accurately measure and control models' persuasive and\nmanipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.", "AI": {"tldr": "As large language models grow, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes crucial.

For\nabout a decade, countless attack and defense methods have been proposed,\nleading to robustified classifiers and better understanding of models. Among\nthese methods, curvature-based approaches have attracted attention because it\nis assumed that high curvature may give rise to rough decision boundary.\nHowever, the most commonly used \\textit{curvature} is the curvature of loss\nfunction, scores or other parameters from within the model as opposed to\ndecision boundary curvature, since the former can be relatively easily formed\nusing second order derivative. In this paper, we propose a new query-efficient\nmethod, dynamic curvature estimation(DCE), to estimate the decision boundary\ncurvature in a black-box setting.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which\nempowers LLMs to generate more qualified responses with retrieved external data\nand knowledge, has shown its high promise. However, traditional semantic\nsimilarity-based RAGs struggle to return concise yet highly relevant\ninformation for domain knowledge-intensive tasks, such as scientific\nquestion-answering (QA). Built on a multi-dimensional (cube) structure called\nHypercube, which can index documents in an application-driven, human-defined,\nmulti-dimensional space, we introduce the Hypercube-RAG, a novel RAG framework\nfor precise and efficient retrieval. Given a query, Hypercube-RAG first\ndecomposes it based on its entities and topics and then retrieves relevant\ndocuments from cubes by aligning these decomposed components with hypercube\ndimensions. Experiments on three in-domain scientific QA datasets demonstrate\nthat our method improves accuracy by 3.7% and boosts retrieval efficiency by\n81.2%, measured as relative gains over the strongest RAG baseline.

Such objectives inherently exhibit\nmode-seeking behavior, potentially leading to incomplete representation of the\nunderlying distribution.

We start with the basics of\nassociative memory (think simple linear attention) and then dive into two\ndimensions:\n  Memory Capacity: How much can a Transformer really remember, and how well? We\nintroduce retrieval SNR to measure this and use a kernel perspective to\nmathematically reveal why Softmax Attention is so effective. We also show how\nFFNs can be seen as a type of associative memory, leading to insights on their\ndesign and potential improvements.\n  Memory Update: How do these memories learn and evolve? We present a unified\nframework for understanding how different Transformer variants (like DeltaNet\nand Softmax Attention) update their \"knowledge base\".

For embodied AI, our results emphasize the importance of\nrecurrent EAD architectures to handle realistic tactile inputs, along with\ntailored self-supervised learning methods for achieving robust tactile\nperception with the same type of sensors animals use to sense in unstructured\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "EAD\u6846\u67b6\u88ab\u5f15\u5165\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0cConvRNNs\u88ab\u786e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u89e6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4f18\u79c0\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u556e\u9f7f\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u611f\u76ae\u5c42\u7d27\u5bc6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u7684ConvRNN-EAD\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5faa\u73af\u5904\u7406\u5728\u4f53\u611f\u76ae\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5faa\u73afEAD\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u89e6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7b49\u6210\u719f\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684Encoder-Attender-Decoder\uff08EAD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u556e\u9f7f\u52a8\u7269\u80e1\u987b\u9635\u5217\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u89e6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5377\u79ef\u9012\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ConvRNNs\uff09\u662f\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u524d\u9988\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u5229\u7528EAD\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4e0e\u556e\u9f7f\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u611f\u76ae\u5c42\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u7684ConvRNN-EAD\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "ConvRNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u7840\u7684EAD\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u556e\u9f7f\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u611f\u76ae\u5c42\u7d27\u5bc6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9971\u548c\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u7684ConvRNN-EAD\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u5730\u5339\u914d\u76d1\u7763\u795e\u7ecf\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5faa\u73af\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f53\u611f\u76ae\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u89e6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\uff0c\u5faa\u73afEAD\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u89e6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we address the fundamental long-standing question about the\nconcentration of distances in high dimension for fractional quasi $p$-norms,\n$p\\in(0,1)$. The topic has been at the centre of various theoretical and\nempirical controversies. Here we, for the first time, identify conditions when\nfractional quasi $p$-norms concentrate and when they don't. We show that\ncontrary to some earlier suggestions, for broad classes of distributions,\nfractional quasi $p$-norms admit exponential and uniform in $p$ concentration\nbounds. For these distributions, the results effectively rule out previously\nproposed approaches to alleviate concentration by \"optimal\" setting the values\nof $p$ in $(0,1)$.

Clinical data used to support these decisions are often irregularly\nsampled, sparse, and noisy.

Moreover, they often overlook the clinical\nsignificance of irregular recording frequencies, filtering out patterns in how\nand when data is collected. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a natural fit for\nclinical decision-making, enabling sequential, long-term optimization in\ndynamic, uncertain environments.

An Empirical Study", "categories": ["cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown significant potential\nfor embodied AI. However, their predominant training via supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) limits generalization due to susceptibility to compounding errors under\ndistribution shifts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a path to overcome\nthese limitations by optimizing for task objectives via trial-and-error, yet a\nsystematic understanding of its specific generalization benefits for VLAs\ncompared to SFT is lacking. To address this, our study introduces a\ncomprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLA generalization and systematically\ninvestigates the impact of RL fine-tuning across diverse visual, semantic, and\nexecution dimensions. Our extensive experiments reveal that RL fine-tuning,\nparticularly with PPO, significantly enhances generalization in semantic\nunderstanding and execution robustness over SFT, while maintaining comparable\nvisual robustness. We identify PPO as a more effective RL algorithm for VLAs\nthan LLM-derived methods like DPO and GRPO. We also develop a simple recipe for\nefficient PPO training on VLAs, and demonstrate its practical utility for\nimproving VLA generalization.

However, even with\nsignificant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor\naccelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential\nunderutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts\nof code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization\ntasks, but generating low-resource languages like specialized tensor\naccelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge\nwith Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage\ndomain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated\nLLM-driven search.

Traditional silhouette- and\npose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such\ndistractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less\ninformative inputs. Emerging end-to-end methods address this by directly\ndenoising RGB videos using human priors. Building on this trend, we propose\nDenoisingGait, a novel gait denoising method. Inspired by the philosophy that\n\"what I cannot create, I do not understand\", we turn to generative diffusion\nmodels, uncovering how they partially filter out irrelevant factors for gait\nunderstanding. Additionally, we introduce a geometry-driven Feature Matching\nmodule, which, combined with background removal via human silhouettes,\ncondenses the multi-channel diffusion features at each foreground pixel into a\ntwo-channel direction vector.

Despite this promise, practical AIF agents still rely on\naccurate immediate predictions and exhaustive planning, a limitation that is\nexacerbated in delayed environments requiring plans over long horizons, tens to\nhundreds of steps. Moreover, most existing agents are evaluated on robotic or\nvision benchmarks which, while natural for biological agents, fall short of\nreal-world industrial complexity. We address these limitations with a\ngenerative-policy architecture featuring (i) a multi-step latent transition\nthat lets the generative model predict an entire horizon in a single\nlook-ahead, (ii) an integrated policy network that enables the transition and\nreceives gradients of the expected free energy, (iii) an alternating\noptimization scheme that updates model and policy from a replay buffer, and\n(iv) a single gradient step that plans over long horizons, eliminating\nexhaustive planning from the control loop. We evaluate our agent in an\nenvironment that mimics a realistic industrial scenario with delayed and\nlong-horizon settings. The empirical results confirm the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach, demonstrating the coupled world-model with the AIF formalism\nyields an end-to-end probabilistic controller capable of effective decision\nmaking in delayed, long-horizon settings without handcrafted rewards or\nexpensive planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u6f5c\u5728\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5355\u68af\u5ea6\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff08AIF\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u73af\u5883\u548c\u9700\u8981\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5de5\u4e1a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u591a\u6b65\u6f5c\u5728\u8f6c\u6362\uff1a\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6574\u4e2a\u89c6\u91ce\u3002\n2. \u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6c\u6362\u5e76\u63a5\u6536\u9884\u671f\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\n3. \u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u4ece\u91cd\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u3002\n4. \u5355\u68af\u5ea6\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u56de\u8def\u4e2d\u6d88\u9664\u8be6\u5c3d\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eAIF\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6982\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u957f\u671f\u89c6\u91ce\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AIF\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u957f\u671f\u89c6\u91ce\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u6602\u8d35\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u6548\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing causal mask-based strategies are\ninherited from large language models (LLMs) where they are tailored for\ntext-only decoding, and their adaptation to vision tokens is insufficiently\naddressed in the prefill stage. Strictly masking future positions for vision\nqueries introduces overly rigid constraints, which hinder the model's ability\nto leverage future context that often contains essential semantic cues for\naccurate inference. In this work, we empirically investigate how different\ncausal masking strategies affect vision-language inference and then propose a\nfamily of future-aware attentions tailored for this setting.

Existing literature relies on\nvarious assumptions about the reward-generating process, such as Bernoulli or\nsubgaussian rewards. However, in settings such as finance and\ntelecommunications, heavy-tailed distributions naturally arise. In this work,\nwe tackle the heavy-tailed piecewise-stationary bandit problem. Heavy-tailed\nbandits, introduced by Bubeck et al., 2013, operate on the minimal assumption\nthat the finite absolute centered moments of maximum order $1+\\epsilon$ are\nuniformly bounded by a constant $v<+\\infty$, for some $\\epsilon \\in (0,1]$. We\nfocus on the most popular non-stationary bandit setting, i.e., the\npiecewise-stationary setting, in which the mean of reward-generating\ndistributions may change at unknown time steps.

Recently, significant\nprogress has been made to address these challenges, particularly by using large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to design heuristics within some predetermined\ngeneralized algorithmic framework (GAF, e.g., ant colony optimization and\nguided local search) for building key functions/components (e.g., a priori\ninformation on how promising it is to include each edge in a solution for TSP\nand CVRP).

However, tasks such as biological sequence design involve\nsearching for sequences that improve desirable properties beyond previously\nknown values, which requires novel hypotheses that \\emph{extrapolate} beyond\ntraining data. In these settings, extrapolation may be achieved by using random\nsearch methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which, given an initial\nstate, sample local transformations to approximate a target density that\nrewards states with the desired properties. However, even with a well-designed\nproposal, MCMC may struggle to explore large structured state spaces\nefficiently. Rather than relying on stochastic search, it would be desirable to\nhave a model that greedily optimizes the properties of interest, successfully\nextrapolating in as few steps as possible. We propose to learn such a model\nfrom the Markov chains resulting from MCMC search.

Building on the\ntheoretical framework for SGMs in Hilbert spaces, we give a rigorous definition\nof this sampler in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive, for the first\ntime, error estimates that explicitly depend on the approximation error of the\nscore. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for global convergence\nin Kullback-Leibler divergence on the underlying function space.

In\nthis study, we utilize deep learning to introduce a novel saliency-based\napproach to emotion prediction by extracting two key features: saliency area\nand number of salient regions. Using the HD2S saliency model and OpenFace\nfacial action unit analysis, we examine the relationship between video saliency\nand viewer emotions. Our findings reveal three key insights: (1) Videos with\nmultiple salient regions tend to elicit high-valence, low-arousal emotions, (2)\nVideos with a single dominant salient region are more likely to induce\nlow-valence, high-arousal responses, and (3) Self-reported emotions often\nmisalign with facial expression-based emotion detection, suggesting limitations\nin subjective reporting.

To mitigate this defect of DiTs, we propose a novel split-text\nconditioning framework named DiT-ST.

The\nsplit-text caption is then injected into different denoising stages of DiT-ST\nin a hierarchical and incremental manner.

Moreover, we partition the diffusion denoising process according to its\ndifferential sensitivities to diverse semantic primitive types and determine\nthe appropriate timesteps to incrementally inject tokens of diverse semantic\nprimitive types into input tokens via cross-attention.

Difficulties mainly arise when integrating dynamic\nenvironments, e.g., the integration at design time of not yet existing\nservices. This has been traditionally addressed using a registry that provides\nthe API documentation of the endpoints. Large Language Models have shown to be\ncapable of automatically creating system integrations (e.g., as service\ncomposition) based on this documentation but require concise input due to input\noken limitations, especially regarding comprehensive API descriptions.\nCurrently, it is unknown how best to preprocess these API descriptions. In the\npresent work, we (i) analyze the usage of Retrieval Augmented Generation for\nendpoint discovery and the chunking, i.e., preprocessing, of state-of-practice\nOpenAPIs to reduce the input oken length while preserving the most relevant\ninformation. To further reduce the input token length for the composition\nprompt and improve endpoint retrieval, we propose (ii) a Discovery Agent that\nonly receives a summary of the most relevant endpoints nd retrieves\nspecification details on demand. We evaluate RAG for endpoint discovery using\n(iii) a proposed novel service discovery benchmark SOCBench-D representing a\ngeneral setting across numerous domains and the real-world RestBench enchmark,\nfirst, for the different chunking possibilities and parameters measuring the\nendpoint retrieval accuracy.

In\nthis paper, we comprehensively investigate the factors which may degenerate the\nvisual reliance in text generation of LVLM from a Bayesian perspective.

Addressing\nthis challenge would enable robots to develop a more profound grasp of their\noperational context. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework for online\nlearning of hidden state representations, with which the robots can adapt in\nreal-time to uncertain and dynamic conditions that would otherwise be ambiguous\nand result in suboptimal or erroneous behaviors. Our approach is formalized as\na Generalized Hidden Parameter Markov Decision Process, which explicitly models\nthe influence of unobserved parameters on both transition dynamics and reward\nstructures. Our core innovation lies in learning online the joint distribution\nof state transitions, which serves as an expressive representation of latent\nego- and environmental-factors. This probabilistic approach supports the\nidentification and adaptation to different operational situations, improving\nrobustness and safety. Through a multivariate extension of Bayesian Online\nChangepoint Detection, our method segments changes in the underlying data\ngenerating process governing the robot's dynamics.

However, its\neffectiveness is often hindered by challenges such as identifying relevant\nvariables that define heterogeneous subgroups and handling data that are\nmissing not at random, a prevalent issue in fields like transcriptomics. While\nseveral notable methods have been proposed to address these problems, they\ntypically tackle each issue in isolation, thereby limiting their flexibility\nand adaptability. This paper introduces a unified framework designed to address\nthese challenges simultaneously.

To substantiate these arguments, the paper outlines\nseveral research areas -- including alignment, watermarking, uncertainty\nquantification, evaluation, and data mixture optimization -- where statistical\nmethodologies are critically needed and are already beginning to make valuable\ncontributions.

A\nparameter-dependent mathematical model of the physical process is employed.

This raises the question of how accurately these\nmulti-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in\nmulti-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in\nstudying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such\nmulti-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates\ninformation across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to\nhigher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and\ntwo types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine\nwhich type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants\nare engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal\nmodels show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This\nstudy also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus\nmulti-modal information.

These models are typically adapted\nfrom text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on\naudio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major\nlimitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where\nimportant textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after\ntraining on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that\nare not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability.\nSecond, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically\nrelies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for\ninstruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these\nissues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose\ncaption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping\naudio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs\n(BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds\nThrough Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed\nto improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We\nfurther extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains\nthe differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that\ndescribes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental\nresults indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations\nwhile reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding,\nreasoning, and instruction-following skills.

In\nthis work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on\ntasks with long-inputs (>64K tokens) and long-form outputs. Our evaluation\nspans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4,\nGPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B,\nand 72B). We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy\n(~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for\ntasks involving long context inputs (drops of up to 59%). This degradation\ntends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. Crucially,\nthe effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model,\nand task. For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4,\nLlama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task.

We deploy\nEgoZero policies on a gripper Franka Panda robot and demonstrate zero-shot\ntransfer with 70% success rate over 7 manipulation tasks and only 20 minutes of\ndata collection per task. Our results suggest that in-the-wild human data can\nserve as a scalable foundation for real-world robot learning - paving the way\ntoward a future of abundant, diverse, and naturalistic training data for\nrobots.
