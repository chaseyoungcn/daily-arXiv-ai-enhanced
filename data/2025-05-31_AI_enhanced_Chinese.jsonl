This\nparadigm involves deploying a model provided by a third party on local devices\nto perform inference tasks. However, it exposes the private model to two\nprimary security threats: model stealing (MS) and membership inference attacks\n(MIA). To mitigate these risks, existing wisdom deploys models within Trusted\nExecution Environments (TEEs), which is a secure isolated execution space.\nNonetheless, the constrained secure memory capacity in TEEs makes it\nchallenging to achieve full model security with low inference latency. This\npaper fills the gap with TensorShield, the first efficient on-device inference\nwork that shields partial tensors of the model while still fully defending\nagainst MS and MIA. The key enabling techniques in TensorShield include: (i) a\nnovel eXplainable AI (XAI) technique exploits the model's attention transition\nto assess critical tensors and shields them in TEE to achieve secure inference,\nand (ii) two meticulous designs with critical feature identification and\nlatency-aware placement to accelerate inference while maintaining security.\nExtensive evaluations show that TensorShield delivers almost the same security\nprotection as shielding the entire model inside TEE, while being up to\n25.35$\\times$ (avg. 5.85$\\times$) faster than the state-of-the-art work,\nwithout accuracy loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "TensorShield is an efficient on-device inference method that protects critical tensors in TEEs, providing strong defense against model stealing and membership inference attacks while maintaining low latency and no accuracy loss.", "motivation": "On-device inference is crucial for safeguarding user data privacy on mobile and IoT devices.

A total of 33 participants were recruited for\ndata acquisition, and nine relevant features were extracted from the physical\nactivities and analyzed with their weekly depression scores, evaluated using\nthe Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) questionnaire. Of the nine features, six\nare derived from physical activities, achieving an activity recognition\naccuracy of 95%, while three features stem from sentiment analysis of Twitter\nactivities, yielding a sentiment analysis accuracy of 95.6%. Notably, several\nphysical activity features exhibited significant correlations with the severity\nof depression symptoms. For classifying the depression severity, a support\nvector machine (SVM)-based algorithm is employed that demonstrated a very high\naccuracy of 94%, outperforming alternative models, e.g., the multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbor. It is a simple approach yet highly\neffective in the long run for monitoring depression without breaching personal\nprivacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2a\u4f53\u6291\u90c1\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6734\u7d20\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528SVM\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6291\u90c1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe94%\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u795e\u969c\u788d\uff08\u5982\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\u3001\u7126\u8651\u75c7\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u793e\u4ea4\u56de\u907f\u503e\u5411\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u91cf\u65e5\u5e38\u8eab\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n2. \u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u5728Twitter\u4e0a\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\n3. \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6734\u7d20\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u8eab\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u60c5\u611f\u3002\n4. \u63d0\u53d6\u4e5d\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6bcf\u5468\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u8054\u5206\u6790\u3002\n5. \u4f7f\u7528\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08SVM\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6291\u90c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "1. \u8eab\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523095%\u3002\n2. \u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523095.6%\u3002\n3.

Those debates drew from\nmid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more\nidealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st\ncentury cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories\nto artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this\nhistory. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from\nexperiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which\ntakes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is\npragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally\nfulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism,\ntranscends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or\nchains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about\nthe value of intuition and reflection.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Strategic Reflectivism, a concept that emphasizes the importance of switching between intuitive and reflective thinking for intelligent systems (human or artificial).

This growth is\naccompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the\nmemory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous\napproaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While\nthese methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training\nis significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets.\nMotivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can\nparameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while\nachieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the\nperformance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are\nthe following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that\nsummarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform\na benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training\napproaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We\nobserve that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank\ntraining delivers the best performance, as expected.

The CLIP model is a widely adopted\nfoundational vision language model whose vision encoder has played a critical\nrole in the development of MLLMs such as LLaVA. However, the CLIP vision\nencoder suffers from notable limitations including being constrained to only\nhandling fixed input resolutions and a failure to produce separated embeddings\nfor dissimilar images. Replacing the vision encoder of an existing model\ntypically incurs substantial computational costs because such a change often\nnecessitates retraining the entire model pipeline.\n  In this work, we identify two factors which underlie the limitations of the\nCLIP vision encoder: mesoscopic bias and interpolation bias.

Existing predefined time-domain augmentation\nmethods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series\ndata. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the\nsemantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched\npatterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel\nperspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for\ndownstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize\nthe three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency\nRefined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on\nclassification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive\nlearning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA\nautomatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components.\nAccordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and\nsemantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant\ninformation in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the\nunimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates\nsemantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two\nbenchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale\ndatasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading\nbaselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer\nlearning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive\nrepresentation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios\nacross diverse datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFrequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA) \u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002FreRA\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u79bb\u5173\u952e\u548c\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u5f0f\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFreRA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u501f\u9274\u81ea\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u672a\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5931\u771f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u9891\u7387\u57df\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014Frequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA)\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u79bb\u5173\u952e\u548c\u4e0d\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u6539\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08UCR\u548cUEA\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e94\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFreRA\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5341\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Frequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in\nLLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be\nrecalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset\nof 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English\noriginals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new\ntranslations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,\nMalagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families\nand sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to\nidentify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting\nmasked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating\ncontinuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,\neven for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for\nexample, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%\nof the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking\ncharacters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop\nfor shuffled official translations).

Additionally, the\nsubstantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in\ntime-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes\nSentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel\nmodels the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in\nthe pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a\nstrategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers\nan appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the\nscheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that\nSentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by\n74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u76f4\u64ad\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSentinel\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3Crowdsourced Cloud-edge service Platforms\uff08CCPs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002Sentinel\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684Pre-Post-Scheduling\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8c03\u5ea6\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u540e\u8c03\u5ea6\u9636\u6bb5\u6839\u636e\u8bf7\u6c42\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSentinel\u80fd\u51cf\u5c1170%\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad874%\u7684\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u8c03\u5ea6\u901f\u5ea6\u7ffb\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u76f4\u64ad\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7fa4\u667a\u4e91\u8fb9\u670d\u52a1\u5e73\u53f0\uff08CCPs\uff09\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u6325\u7740\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8eCCPs\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014Sentinel\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8c03\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684Pre-Post-Scheduling\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5728\u9884\u8c03\u5ea6\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cSentinel\u6267\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u6c60\uff1b\u5728\u540e\u8c03\u5ea6\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5f53\u8bf7\u6c42\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\uff0c\u89e6\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u5148\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65bd\u8c03\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cSentinel\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8670%\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8674%\u7684\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u8c03\u5ea6\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e00\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Sentinel\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86CCPs\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant\nof MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document\nusing a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the\nperformance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level\nmachine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks.

Existing methods typically employ\ndynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However,\ntheir reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture\nglobal contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent\ninternal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address\nthese limitations, we propose \\textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware,\ndynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical\nattention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global\ncontextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy.

Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce\nmisaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS\nframework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues.

To interpret these behaviors, we\nintroduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies\nsemantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based\nrepresentational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with\nthe cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn\nprovides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across\ntraining, linking representational structure to reasoning capability.

In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate\ncontrast to distinguish between \"rim\" lesions, surrounded by deposited\nparamagnetic iron, and \"non-rim\" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions\n(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been\ndevoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor\nlongitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this\nproblem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim\nlesions.

Prior theoretical work exploring the\nexpressive power of transformers has shown that they can efficiently perform\nmulti-step reasoning tasks involving parallelizable computations. However, the\nlearnability of such constructions, particularly the conditions on the data\ndistribution that enable efficient learning via gradient-based optimization,\nremains an open question. Towards answering this question, in this work we\nstudy the learnability of the $k$-fold composition task, which requires\ncomputing an interleaved composition of $k$ input permutations and $k$ hidden\npermutations, and can be expressed by a transformer with $O(\\log k)$ layers.

While SWE-bench and its variants have become\nstandard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been\nupdated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and\ndepend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment\nsetup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and\ndata contamination. In this work, we present \\textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a\n\\textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our\ninitial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created\nsince 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated\nDocker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is\n\\method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process\nfrom instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and\nenabling scalability and continuous updates.

Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's\nlaw, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a\nproxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we\nalleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and\nthe assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the\neffect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on\nGoodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and\nlight tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's\neffect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we\nexhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely\nproportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and\nthe metric. %", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u653e\u5bbd\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u53e4\u5fb7\u54c8\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8f7b\u5c3e\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8f7b\u5c3e\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u53e4\u5fb7\u54c8\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u8f7b\u5c3e\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u91cd\u5c3e\u6027\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u53e4\u5fb7\u54c8\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5f00\u59cb\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53e4\u5fb7\u54c8\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u653e\u5bbd\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u53e4\u5fb7\u54c8\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8f7b\u5c3e\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5dee\u5f02\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) \u5728\u8f7b\u5c3e\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u8f7b\u5c3e\u5dee\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u53e4\u5fb7\u54c8\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff1b2) \u5728\u8f7b\u5c3e\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u5dee\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u91cd\u5c3e\u6027\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u53e4\u5fb7\u54c8\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89c4\u907f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53e4\u5fb7\u54c8\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

For instance, DeepSeek-R1\nreports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while\nOpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally\nraises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to\nhallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)\nWe first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our\nanalysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold\nstart supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate\ntheir hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training\nwithout cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To\nexplore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on\nhallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two\ncritical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw\nRepetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the\nsame underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer\nfails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate\nthe mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model\nuncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated\nwith the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy.

Our\nexperimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Muon\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9aMuon\u4f18\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMuon\u53ef\u4ee5\u4eceHessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5206\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u77e9\u9635\u53c2\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}
