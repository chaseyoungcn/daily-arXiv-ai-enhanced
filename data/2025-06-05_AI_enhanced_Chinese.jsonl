However, existing methods rely on joint training of the\nguidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the\nearly stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning\nsignals.

This\nmodularization reduces memory usage, improves computational efficiency, and\nenhances both sample efficiency and final performance.\n  Cross-Module Transferability: Applying two independently trained guidance\nmodels, one during training and the other during inference, can significantly\nreduce normalized score variance (e.g., reducing IQR by 86%).

Traditional\ndetection approaches rely on machine learning classifiers or rule-based\nscanners operating in the cloud, but these face significant challenges in\ngeneralization, privacy, and evasion by sophisticated threats. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel client-side framework for comprehensive URL analysis that\nleverages zero-shot inference by a local large language model (LLM) running\nentirely in-browser. Our system uses a compact LLM (e.g., 3B/8B parameters) via\nWebLLM to perform reasoning over rich context collected from the target\nwebpage, including static code analysis (JavaScript abstract syntax trees,\nstructure, and code patterns), dynamic sandbox execution results (DOM changes,\nAPI calls, and network requests),and visible content. We detail the\narchitecture and methodology of the system, which combines a real browser\nsandbox (using iframes) resistant to common anti-analysis techniques, with an\nLLM-based analyzer that assesses potential vulnerabilities and malicious\nbehaviors without any task-specific training (zero-shot). The LLM aggregates\nevidence from multiple sources (code, execution trace, page content) to\nclassify the URL as benign or malicious and to provide an explanation of the\nthreats or security issues identified. We evaluate our approach on a diverse\nset of benign and malicious URLs, demonstrating that even a compact client-side\nmodel can achieve high detection accuracy and insightful explanations\ncomparable to cloud-based solutions, while operating privately on end-user\ndevices.

Despite\nextensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations\nremain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI\nsystems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions --\ntheir metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this\nperspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We\ndo so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria -- formal\nrules that answer the questions \"When are two AI systems the same?\" and \"When\ndoes an AI system persist, despite change?\" Building on Carrara and Vermaas'\naccount of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness\nprovides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of\nthese artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical\nmake-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their\ntrustworthiness profiles -- the collection of capabilities that the systems\nmust uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their\neffectiveness in maintaining these capabilities.

As\nphysical environments are too complex to model through a single information\nacquisition approach, it is crucial to fuse multimodal data generated by\ndifferent sources, such as sensors, devices, systems, and people, to solve a\nproblem in the real world. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable nor\nsustainable to deploy new resources to collect original data from scratch for\nevery problem. Thus, when data is inadequate in the domain of problem, it is\nvital to fuse knowledge from multimodal data that is already available in other\ndomains. We call this cross-domain knowledge fusion. Existing research focus on\nfusing multimodal data in a single domain, supposing the knowledge from\ndifferent datasets is intrinsically aligned; however, this assumption may not\nhold in the scenarios of cross-domain knowledge fusion. In this paper, we\nformally define the cross-domain multimodal data fusion problem, discussing its\nunique challenges, differences and advantages beyond data fusion in a single\ndomain. We propose a four-layer framework, consisting of Domains, Links, Models\nand Data layers, answering three key questions: \"what to fuse\", \"why can be\nfused\", and \"how to fuse\". The Domains Layer selects relevant data from\ndifferent domains for a given problem. The Links Layer reveals the philosophy\nof knowledge alignment beyond specific model structures.

However, current detection methods often suffer from\nweak generalization: their effectiveness tends to degrade significantly when\napplied to adversarially trained models rather than naturally trained ones, and\nthey generally struggle to achieve consistent effectiveness across both\nwhite-box and black-box attack settings. In this work, we observe that an\nauxiliary model, differing from the primary model in training strategy or model\narchitecture, tends to assign low confidence to the primary model's predictions\non adversarial examples (AEs), while preserving high confidence on normal\nexamples (NEs). Based on this discovery, we propose Prediction Inconsistency\nDetector (PID), a lightweight and generalizable detection framework to\ndistinguish AEs from NEs by capturing the prediction inconsistency between the\nprimal and auxiliary models. PID is compatible with both naturally and\nadversarially trained primal models and outperforms four detection methods\nacross 3 white-box, 3 black-box, and 1 mixed adversarial attacks.

Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive\nmodels or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications\nof quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses\nthat gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines\nquantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of\nsocial norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition,\nentanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a\ndynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These\nscenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving\nroles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment\nmonitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to\nsurveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions\nallow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent\npatterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with\ngenerative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and\ninterdependence in complex social systems. Simulations reveal patterns\nincluding convergence toward normative order, the spread of resistance, and the\nspontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. In conclusion, this\nstudy introduces a novel computational lens that lays the groundwork for a\nquantum-informed social theory. It offers interdisciplinary insights into how\nsociety can be understood not just as a structure to observe but as a dynamic\nsystem to simulate and redesign through quantum technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u867d\u7136\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u54f2\u5b66\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e0a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u539f\u7406\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\u3002\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6982\u5ff5\u5982\u53e0\u52a0\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e94\u4e2a\u7406\u60f3\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u752825\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7406\uff08\u89d2\u8272\u4e3a\u9075\u4ece\u8005\u3001\u53cd\u6297\u8005\u6216\u6267\u884c\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u4e2d\u592e\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\uff08Watcher\uff09\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u76d1\u63a7\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6d8c\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5411\u89c4\u8303\u79e9\u5e8f\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3001\u53cd\u6297\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u4ee5\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u5219\u4e2d\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7406\u8bba\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5373\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

This process, which we call context traceback, has various\nreal-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting\npost-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,\nknowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources\nto enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied\nto context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution\nmethods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large\ncomputational cost.

Increasing the number of denoising steps is the\nprimary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns.

A recent development in time series XAI is the\nconcept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can\nbe interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as\nfrequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the\ntime domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate\nattributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and\nfrequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This\nsuggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more\ncomprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain\nexplanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty\nprinciple (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in\nharmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle\nestablishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized\nin both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess\nwhether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound,\nindicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a\nsufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not\nmatch and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the\neffectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI\nmethods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The\nfrequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods\nhighlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on\ntime-domain explanations.

With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has\nprimarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to\nsolve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we\nstill need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle\ndiverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual\nlearning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is\nstill necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating\nknowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information;\n(ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise,\nadapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints\nwithout full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long\ncontext-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular\napproach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and\nagents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted. While continual\npre-training and fine-tuning are explored as niche research directions, we\nargue it is continual compositionality that will mark the rebirth of continual\nlearning.

Understanding Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,\nDeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using\nprompts like \"Wait\" or \"Let me rethink\" can improve performance. This raises a\nnatural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better\nreasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time\nscaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the\ninference thinking budget.

This work introduces Meerkat, a sparse\nzeroth-order optimization (ZO) method designed for federated LLM fine-tuning.\nBy limiting fine-tuning to a transferable, static, extremely sparse subset of\nparameters, Meerkat achieves remarkable communication efficiency, enabling\ncost-effective high-frequency synchronization. With theoretical analysis and\nexperiments, we show that this high-frequency communication effectively\nmitigates Non-IID data challenges and leads to superior performance compared to\nfull-parameter ZO. Furthermore, experiment results show that Meerkat\noutperforms existing sparsity baselines with better performance at the same\ncommunication frequency. To further handle Non-IID drift, Meerkat leverages\ntraceable local updates and forms a virtual path for each client. This virtual\npath mechanism reveals the GradIP phenomenon: the inner products between LLM\npre-training gradients maintained by server and client gradients estimated via\nZO converges for extreme Non-IID clients but oscillates for IID ones.

Despite its success, ICL suffers from several\nlimitations, including sensitivity to demonstration order, context length\nconstraints, and computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, task\nvector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.\nHowever, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of\ndemonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the\nspecific input. This limitation can lead models to struggle with effective\nadaptation when the input query is not well aligned with the underlying\ndemonstrations, consequently degrading their generalization performance on\nunseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Task Vectors\n(ATV), a simple and effective framework that dynamically generates task vectors\nconditioned on each input query. ATV employs a small language model to generate\ntask vectors, which are then transformed to match the target LLM's architecture\nand applied to guide its output generation. In contrast to ICL and previous\nvector-based approaches, which rely on fixed demonstration sets and their\ncorresponding vectors, ATV dynamically generates task vectors tailored to each\nspecific input query and task.

A parameter sweep was conducted over\nthe (alpha, beta) thresholds, where alpha and beta are in the range {0, 1, 2,\n3, 4} and not both zero, to identify the optimal combination that minimizes\nRMSD. Experimental results on a randomly selected wafer file reveal that\n(alpha, beta) equal (2, 2) yields the lowest RMSD. Accordingly, all subsequent\nexperiments adopt this parameter configuration. The results demonstrate that\nthe proposed SDE-based strategies enhance predictive accuracy: K-SDE improves\nupon k-means sampling by 16.26 percent (wafer) and 13.07 percent (FPGA), while\nS-SDE improves upon stratified sampling by 16.49 percent (wafer) and 8.84\npercent (FPGA).", "AI": {"tldr": "In semiconductor testing, this paper explores three baseline sampling methods and proposes a novel Short Distance Elimination (SDE) algorithm to improve these strategies.

However, it is very\ndifficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem.\nAdditionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for\ndifferent subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is\nneeded to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This\narticle introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta\ndistribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta\ndistribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our\nLCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different\nsubspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision\nboundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by\ncontrolling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as\ntrapezoidal ones.

While artificial intelligence (AI)\noffers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its\nuse in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality\n(LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At\nthis transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data,\nexemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic\nreasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model\n(CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained\non a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition.\nThis transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably\npower-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system\nmaximizes a ``critical thinking pattern\" crucial for generalization, enabled by\nthe underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak\nperformance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable\nthe extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum\nfield theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a\nfew exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems,\nsignificantly outperforming far larger models.

These\nprograms have recently come under scrutiny due to accusations of unfair\npractices in their implementation. Motivated by these concerns, we study the\nproblem of fairly designing points-based rewards programs, with a focus on two\nobstacles that put fairness at odds with their effectiveness. First, due to\ncustomer heterogeneity, the seller should set different redemption thresholds\nfor different customers to generate high revenue. Second, the relationship\nbetween customer behavior and the number of accumulated points is typically\nunknown; this requires experimentation which may unfairly devalue customers'\npreviously earned points. We first show that an individually fair rewards\nprogram that uses the same redemption threshold for all customers suffers a\nloss in revenue of at most a factor of $1+\\ln 2$, compared to the optimal\npersonalized strategy that differentiates between customers. We then tackle the\nproblem of designing temporally fair learning algorithms in the presence of\ndemand uncertainty. Toward this goal, we design a learning algorithm that\nlimits the risk of point devaluation due to experimentation by only changing\nthe redemption threshold $O(\\log T)$ times, over a horizon of length $T$.

Firstly, the highly varied datasets, model heterogeneity scenarios,\nand different method implementations become hurdles to making easy and fair\ncomparisons among HtFL methods. Secondly, the effectiveness and robustness of\nHtFL methods are under-explored in various scenarios, such as the medical\ndomain and sensor signal modality. To fill this gap, we introduce the first\nHeterogeneous Federated Learning Library (HtFLlib), an easy-to-use and\nextensible framework that integrates multiple datasets and model heterogeneity\nscenarios, offering a robust benchmark for research and practical applications.\nSpecifically, HtFLlib integrates (1) 12 datasets spanning various domains,\nmodalities, and data heterogeneity scenarios; (2) 40 model architectures,\nranging from small to large, across three modalities; (3) a modularized and\neasy-to-extend HtFL codebase with implementations of 10 representative HtFL\nmethods; and (4) systematic evaluations in terms of accuracy, convergence,\ncomputation costs, and communication costs. We emphasize the advantages and\npotential of state-of-the-art HtFL methods and hope that HtFLlib will catalyze\nadvancing HtFL research and enable its broader applications.

Rather than minimizing the loss on neuron input\ncurrent as OBC does, OSBC achieves more efficient and accurate SNN compression\nin one pass by minimizing the loss on spiking neuron membrane potential with a\nsmall sample dataset. Our experiments on neuromorphic datasets (N-MNIST,\nCIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture) demonstrate that OSBC can achieve 97% sparsity\nthrough pruning with 1.41%, 10.20%, and 1.74% accuracy loss, or 4-bit symmetric\nquantization with 0.17%, 1.54%, and 7.71% accuracy loss, respectively.

In this\npaper, we propose Position Specialists (PosS), which consist of multiple\nposition-specialized draft layers to generate tokens at assigned position(s).\nPosition specialists greatly improve token acceptance rate at later positions\nper drafting round, as each specialist only needs to focus on handling a\ncertain level of draft model feature deviation. Experiment results on\nLlama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-2-13B-chat across six datasets demonstrate that\nPosS effectively improves over baselines on average acceptance length and\nspeed-up ratio.

Although human-AI\ncollaboration alleviates these issues, it often relies heavily on extensive\nhuman intervention, which increases costs and reduces efficiency. This paper\ndevelops a confidence-guided human-AI collaboration (C-HAC) strategy to\novercome these limitations. First, C-HAC employs a distributional proxy value\npropagation method within the distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC)\nframework. By leveraging return distributions to represent human intentions\nC-HAC achieves rapid and stable learning of human-guided policies with minimal\nhuman interaction. Subsequently, a shared control mechanism is activated to\nintegrate the learned human-guided policy with a self-learning policy that\nmaximizes cumulative rewards. This enables the agent to explore independently\nand continuously enhance its performance beyond human guidance. Finally, a\npolicy confidence evaluation algorithm capitalizes on DSAC's return\ndistribution networks to facilitate dynamic switching between human-guided and\nself-learning policies via a confidence-based intervention function. This\nensures the agent can pursue optimal policies while maintaining safety and\nperformance guarantees. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios\nreveal that C-HAC significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of\nsafety, efficiency, and overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults.

In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able\nto solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient\ndata, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL\nalgorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously\nunsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL\ndatasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL\nalgorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum\nperformance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor\nscaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several\nanalysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental\nbarrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction\ntechniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our\ninsights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that\neffectively reduces the horizon.

However, the long and\nverbose CoT traces, especially those distilled from large reasoning models\n(LRMs) such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly increase training costs during the\ndistillation process, where a non-reasoning base model is taught to replicate\nthe reasoning behavior of an LRM. In this work, we study the problem of CoT\ncondensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning\nintermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling\nsupervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both\nanswer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our\nrationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem\nunderstanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical\nanalysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace,\nespecially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues)\nand the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless\nreasoning supervision. To this end, we propose an Edge-Preserving Condensation\nmethod, EPiC, which selectively retains only the initial and final segments of\neach CoT trace while discarding the middle portion. This design draws an\nanalogy to preserving the \"edge\" of a reasoning trajectory, capturing both the\ninitial problem framing and the final answer synthesis, to maintain logical\ncontinuity. Experiments across multiple model families (Qwen and LLaMA) and\nbenchmarks show that EPiC reduces training time by over 34% while achieving\nlossless reasoning accuracy on MATH500, comparable to full CoT supervision.

By\nincorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we\nintroduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B\nMLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath,\nLogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d7Deepseek-R1\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51fa\u8272\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u6765\u6fc0\u52b1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a1) \u6709\u6548\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347MLLM\u63a8\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b2) \u6807\u51c6\u7684GRPO\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001RL\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3) \u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001RL\u4e4b\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u7eaf\u6587\u672cRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ReVisual-R1\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f00\u6e907B MLLMs\u7684\u65b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bb8\u591a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u6fc0\u52b1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8eDeepseek-R1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6fc0\u6d3b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e09\u4e2a\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a1. \u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9009\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bb8\u591a\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u591a\u6a21\u6001RL\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u51c6GRPO\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3. \u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001RL\u4e4b\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672cRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ReVisual-R1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ReVisual-R1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f00\u6e907B MLLMs\u7684\u65b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5305\u62ecMathVerse\u3001MathVision\u3001WeMath\u3001LogicVista\u3001DynaMath\u4ee5\u53caAIME2024\u548cAIME2025\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001RL\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

(2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an\nenhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object\ndetection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our\nmethod achieved 66.6\\% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any\npre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson\nXavier NX and Orin NX.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670dYOLO\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u53caTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6MambaNeXt-YOLO\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86CNN\u548cMamba\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u652f\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u878d\u5408\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MAFPN\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PASCAL VOC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8666.6%\u7684mAP\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a31.9 FPS\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1YOLO\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4eba\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0cTransformer\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c8\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MambaNeXt-YOLO\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8d21\u732e\uff1a(1) MambaNeXt Block\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06CNN\u4e0eMamba\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b(2) \u591a\u5206\u652f\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u878d\u5408\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MAFPN\uff09\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u5927\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b(3) \u8fb9\u7f18\u805a\u7126\u6548\u7387\uff1a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PASCAL VOC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8666.6%\u7684mAP\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a31.9 FPS\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5982NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX\u548cOrin NX\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "MambaNeXt-YOLO\u5728PASCAL VOC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8666.6%\u7684mAP\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523031.9 FPS\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX\u548cOrin NX\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaNeXt-YOLO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548cMamba\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5206\u652f\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u878d\u5408\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MAFPN\uff09\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

At Great Ormond\nStreet Hospital (GOSH), the main surgical treatment for patients diagnosed with\nsagittal craniosynostosis (SC) is spring assisted cranioplasty (SAC).

To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we augment\nmalignant cases with Stable Diffusion-generated synthetic lesions and apply a\ndiagnosis-informed relabeling strategy to harmonize external datasets into a\n3-class format. Using partial AUC (pAUC) above 80 percent true positive rate\n(TPR) as the evaluation metric, our approach achieves a pAUC of 0.1755 -- the\nhighest among all configurations. These results underscore the potential of\nhybrid, interpretable AI systems for skin cancer triage in telemedicine and\nresource-constrained settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a hybrid machine and deep learning-based approach for classifying skin lesions using the SLICE-3D dataset, combining vision transformers and convolutional ViT hybrid models with gradient-boosted decision trees.

Among various notions\nof convergence, last-iterate convergence is particularly desirable, as it\nreflects the actual decisions made by the learners and captures the day-to-day\nbehavior of the learning dynamics. While many algorithms are known to converge\nin the average-iterate, achieving last-iterate convergence typically requires\nconsiderably more effort in both the design and the analysis of the algorithm.\nSomewhat surprisingly, we show in this paper that for a large family of games,\nthere exists a simple black-box reduction that transforms the average iterates\nof an uncoupled learning dynamics into the last iterates of a new uncoupled\nlearning dynamics, thus also providing a reduction from last-iterate\nconvergence to average-iterate convergence.

However, they\noften exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text\nwritten by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI)\nmethods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT)\nwhile also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by\ntraining an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text,\nthen apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its\npredictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies\nto modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token\nreplacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability\nto detect AIGT.

While many of the\npresented methods claim to achieve high detection accuracy, they are usually\nevaluated under idealized conditions. In particular, the adversarial robustness\nis often neglected, potentially due to a lack of awareness or the substantial\neffort required to conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis. In this work,\nwe tackle this problem by providing a simpler means to assess the robustness of\nAI-generated image detectors. We present RAID (Robust evaluation of\nAI-generated image Detectors), a dataset of 72k diverse and highly transferable\nadversarial examples. The dataset is created by running attacks against an\nensemble of seven state-of-the-art detectors and images generated by four\ndifferent text-to-image models.

Overlap requires the existence\nof randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many\ntypes of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance,\nobservational studies with deterministic treatment decisions -- popularly known\nas Regression Discontinuity designs -- violate overlap.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the\nidentification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond\nunconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of\nstatistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is\nsufficient and nearly necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this\ncondition characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on\nthe treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as\nwell. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several\nwell-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove\nthat ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For\nexample, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the\nmodels proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression\nDiscontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960).\nFor each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional\nassumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.\n  We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic\ninsights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational\nstudies with complex treatment mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u6df7\u6dc6\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff08ATE\uff09\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5145\u5206\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u56de\u5f52\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65e0\u6df7\u6dc6\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u53e0\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5e38\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u5177\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522bATE\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5145\u5206\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u8bc6\u522bATE\u3002\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff08ATT\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5df2\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ecTan (2006)\u3001Rosenbaum (2002) \u548c Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0cATE\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u3002"}}
