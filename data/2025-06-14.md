### [1] [A Conjecture on a Fundamental Trade-Off between Certainty and Scope in Symbolic and Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10130)
*Luciano Floridi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a conjecture that there is a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in AI systems. This reframes engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the trade-off between provable correctness (demonstrable certainty about error-free outputs) and broad data-mapping capacity (rich information outputs from high-dimensional data) in AI systems.

Method: The article reviews historical motivations, states the conjecture in information-theoretic form, and contextualizes it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and philosophy of technology.

Result: The analysis clarifies the implications of the conjecture on evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design if proven correct.

Conclusion: Proving or refuting the conjecture is crucial for the future development of trustworthy AI.

Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off
between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively
watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of
its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be
narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input
high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary
generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error
performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By
making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous
verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions
and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical
motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in
information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in
epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then
offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of
underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The
discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape
evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The
conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the
inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

### [2] [One Patient, Many Contexts: Scaling Medical AI Through Contextual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10157)
*Michelle M. Li,Ben Y. Reis,Adam Rodman,Tianxi Cai,Noa Dagan,Ran D. Balicer,Joseph Loscalzo,Isaac S. Kohane,Marinka Zitnik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 医疗基础模型（如临床笔记语言模型、医学图像视觉-语言模型和电子健康记录多模态模型）能够总结临床笔记、回答医学问题并辅助决策。然而，这些模型在新的人群、专科或场景中应用时通常需要微调、精心设计的提示或从知识库检索，这限制了它们对未见输入的解释能力和对训练期间未表示临床情况的适应能力。因此，模型容易出现情境错误，即预测看似合理但未能考虑关键患者特定或情境信息。当前模型的一个根本局限性是：难以在医疗护理的不断变化的情境中动态调整其行为。本文提出了一种关于医学人工智能中的情境切换愿景：无需再训练即可动态适应新专科、人群、工作流程和临床角色的模型。我们期望这种情境切换AI能够在各专科和地区中诊断、管理和治疗广泛的疾病，并扩大对医疗服务的获取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗基础模型在面对新情境时，需通过微调或精心设计提示等方式才能适应，这限制了其灵活性和广泛适用性。此外，模型容易因忽略关键患者特定或情境信息而犯错。为解决这一问题，提出了让模型具备动态适应不同医疗情境的能力的需求。

Method: 提出了一种关于医学人工智能中的情境切换愿景，旨在开发能够动态适应新专科、人群、工作流程和临床角色的模型，且无需重新训练。这种方法试图克服现有模型难以在不断变化的情境中调整行为的局限性。

Result: 预期结果是开发出能够在各专科和地区中诊断、管理和治疗广泛疾病的AI系统，并扩大对医疗服务的获取。这将提高AI在医疗领域的灵活性和适用性，减少情境错误的发生。

Conclusion: 情境切换在医学AI中的实现将显著提升模型在多样化医疗情境中的适应能力，从而改善诊断、管理和治疗效果，同时扩大医疗服务的可及性。这是未来医学AI发展的重要方向之一。

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

### [3] [Correlation vs causation in Alzheimer's disease: an interpretability-driven study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10179)
*Hamzah Dabool,Raghad Mustafa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the difference between causation and correlation in Alzheimer's disease research using a mix of statistical analysis, machine learning classification, and model interpretability methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features in Alzheimer's disease and to identify true disease drivers rather than just correlated markers.

Method: The study used correlation analysis, machine learning classification with XGBoost algorithm, and model interpretability techniques like SHAP values. It analyzed feature importance and interpretability alongside classical statistical methods.

Result: Key features influencing AD classification were identified, including cognitive scores and genetic risk factors. Strong correlations were found not to necessarily imply causation.

Conclusion: Integrating feature importance and interpretability with traditional statistical analysis can help lay the groundwork for future causal inference studies in Alzheimer's disease.

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and
the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the
relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using
a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and
model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we
identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive
scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of
interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages.
Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply
causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data.
By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical
statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference
studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately,
distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved
early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

### [4] [Towards Responsible AI: Advances in Safety, Fairness, and Accountability of Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10192)
*Filip Cano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents advancements in safety, fairness, transparency and accountability of AI systems, proposing new techniques such as delayed observation resilient shields, fairness shields and quantitative metrics for intentional behavior. These are unified under the reactive decision-making framework to progress towards trustworthy AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure responsible use of artificial intelligence by addressing its safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability.

Method: Extended deterministic shielding techniques for delayed observations; implemented deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated autonomous vehicles; introduced fairness shields for sequential decision-making; proposed a formal framework with quantitative metrics for assessing intentional behaviour in agents.

Result: Enabled practical deployment of safety shields in real-world conditions, prevented collisions in simulations, efficiently balanced fairness with minimal interference, and provided means to determine responsibility in unintended harm cases.

Conclusion: The advancements contribute practically to the realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become
imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal
domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and
multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,
transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical
deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed
observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also
implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated
autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use
of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness
shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in
sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By
optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,
this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For
transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing
intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing
quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to
propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining
responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify
these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,
providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.
Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the
realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the
foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

### [5] [WGSR-Bench: Wargame-based Game-theoretic Strategic Reasoning Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10264)
*Qiyue Yin,Pei Xu,Qiaozhe Li,Shengda Liu,Shengqi Shen,Tong Wang,Yihong Han,Xiaonan Zhao,Likun Yang,Shiyue Cao,Shiyu Qiu,Yuxuan Liu,Shizhao Yu,Lei Cui,Chengxin Yan,Jie Sun,Xiangquan Tang,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly improved AI's reasoning abilities. However, strategic reasoning, a key aspect of human cognition, has not been thoroughly evaluated or modeled. This paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first benchmark for LLMs' strategic reasoning using wargames as an evaluation environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strategic reasoning, which involves assessing multi-agent behaviors, formulating action plans, and adapting strategies, is a critical component of advanced human cognition that has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled in LLMs.

Method: WGSR-Bench is introduced as the first strategy reasoning benchmark for LLMs using wargames. It designs test samples around three core tasks: Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling, and Policy generation, forming the S-POE architecture.

Result: An LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment, providing insights into LLMs' strengths and limitations in game-theoretic strategic reasoning.

Conclusion: With WGSR-Bench, researchers can evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, advancing research in large model-driven strategic intelligence.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a
qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks,
particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic,
and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human
cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent
behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt
strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this
gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark
for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential
high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty,
adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective
testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent
inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around
three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk
modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to
systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an
LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a
comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess
the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic
strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic
intelligence.

### [6] [Closer to Language than Steam: AI as the Cognitive Engine of a New Productivity Revolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10281)
*Xinmin Fang,Lingfeng Tao,Zhengxiong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI is reframed as a cognitive engine sparking a new productivity revolution. It transforms knowledge work similar to how written language augmented human intellect, demanding reevaluation of skills and policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To present AI as a cognitive revolution that goes beyond mechanized tools, akin to the advent of written language in transforming human intellect and productivity.

Method: Develops a theoretical framework comparing AI's impact to historical leaps in information technology, using examples from various domains and adopting a multidisciplinary perspective including computer science, economics, and sociology.

Result: Demonstrates AI's role in driving productivity in cognitive tasks and reshaping work and society through a shift from manual to cognitive productivity.

Conclusion: AI complements human cognitive abilities, marking a significant evolution in productivity and necessitating rethought approaches to skills, organizations, and policies.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a
novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's
physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive
revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human
intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to
historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge
work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of
productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective
combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological
perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual
frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our
central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to
how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity
paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills,
organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity,
concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities,
marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

### [7] [The Alignment Trap: Complexity Barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10304)
*Jasper Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the computational complexity barriers in verifying AI safety as system capabilities grow. It establishes an 'intractability gap' where practical safety needs are computationally infeasible, presenting a strategic trilemma for AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and formalize the challenges in verifying AI safety as systems become more capable, identifying the Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic that highlights the tension between increasing AI capability and societal safety requirements.

Method: Through four core theorems, the authors analyze the relationship between system expressiveness and verification complexity, proving exponential growth of verification complexity, the small fraction of safe policies, the insufficiency of finite alignment techniques, and the measure-zero nature of robust safety properties for neural networks.

Result: Safety verification for AI systems with expressiveness above a critical threshold is coNP-complete and requires exponential time. There exists an 'intractability gap' where practical safety needs are computationally infeasible.

Conclusion: AI development faces a strategic trilemma: constrain system complexity for verifiable safety, accept unverifiable risks while scaling capabilities, or develop new safety paradigms beyond verification.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI
safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems
with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety
verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the
Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI
capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an
inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems,
we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system
expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the
policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal
coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural
networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical
safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We
conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either
constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable
risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms
beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic
complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds
that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core
theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

### [8] [A Benchmark for Generalizing Across Diverse Team Strategies in Competitive Pokémon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10326)
*Cameron Angliss,Jiaxun Cui,Jiaheng Hu,Arrasy Rahman,Peter Stone*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VGC-Bench, a benchmark for Pokemon VGC AI research with datasets and baselines, revealing the challenge of policy generalization across diverse team strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to different strategic landscapes without retraining is crucial in multi-agent learning. Pokemon VGC offers an extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations, making it a challenging domain for this problem.

Method: Introduced VGC-Bench which provides infrastructure, evaluation protocols, human-play datasets and a range of baselines including large-language-model agents, behavior cloning, reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic methods. Evaluated all baseline methods over progressively larger team sets.

Result: In the restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team configuration, the methods are able to win against a professional VGC competitor. However, as team size grows, even the best-performing algorithm struggles at scaling up.

Conclusion: Policy generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the community.

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different
strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent
learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an
extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately
$10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete,
combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal
strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and
the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance
research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides
critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies
human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents
and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic
methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the
restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team
configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC
competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively
larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the
single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy
generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the
community. Our code is open sourced at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Optimus-3 is a general-purpose agent for Minecraft that surpasses existing models and agents in various tasks through knowledge-enhanced data generation, MoE architecture with task-level routing, and multimodal reasoning-augmented reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a generalist agent capable of perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft, overcoming challenges such as insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous tasks, and visual diversity.

Method: 1) A knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline for scalable and high-quality training data. 2) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing to mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks. 3) Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance reasoning ability for visual diversity.

Result: Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

Conclusion: The innovations presented lead to the development of Optimus-3, a successful general-purpose agent for Minecraft, demonstrating significant advancements in agent capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a
generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action,
grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains
challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous
tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address
these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a
knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and
high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference
among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for
visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present
Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large
language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of
tasks in the Minecraft environment. Project page:

*Jim O'Connor,Yeonghun Lee,Gary B Parker*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework combining NEAT and PAL, accelerates learning in StarCraft macromanagement, reaching competitive play in half the training time of NEAT alone while exhibiting expert-like strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: StarCraft macromanagement poses challenges for AI due to the need for long-term strategic planning. Traditional methods like rule-based systems or supervised deep learning have limitations in adaptability and efficiency.

Method: NeuroPAL integrates NEAT with PAL, alternating between low-fidelity training and high-fidelity evaluations to enhance sample efficiency and accelerate evolutionary training.

Result: NeuroPAL significantly speeds up learning compared to standard NEAT, achieving competitive performance in about half the training time. Evolved agents display advanced strategies similar to those of expert human players.

Conclusion: Structured evaluation mechanisms such as PAL can improve scalability and effectiveness of neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial
intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where
long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft
AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face
limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we
introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates
Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning
(PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating
between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity
evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to
discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate
NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and
compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that
PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach
competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by
NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as
proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies
commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured
evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of
neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

*Yuquan Xie,Zaijing Li,Rui Shao,Gongwei Chen,Kaiwen Zhou,Yinchuan Li,Dongmei Jiang,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. To solve this problem, we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module and Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm, building on HMS, we propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: These GUI agents struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains.

Method: We propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module which progressively abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. We also propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm, which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce the action search space during online tree exploration.

Result: Experimental results show that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32%, 19%, 15%, and 79% on AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

Conclusion: Our proposed methods significantly improve the performance of GUI agents in long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI
agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle
with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient
knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this
paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments,
we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of
insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution
skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical
knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap,
we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm,
which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce
the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we
propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To
validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we
constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1
outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, classifying them into predefined reasoning and agentic reasoning systems, analyzing techniques and discussing challenges while proposing future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of early RAG systems in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration.

Method: Comprehensive review and categorization of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods into predefined reasoning (fixed modular pipelines) and agentic reasoning (autonomous tool interaction).

Result: Analysis of representative techniques covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination.

Conclusion: Discusses key research challenges and proposes future directions to enhance flexibility, robustness, and applicability of Reasoning Agentic RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to
overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG
systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured
tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning,
dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges,
the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds
decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In
this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods,
categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows
fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the
model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze
representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design,
reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research
challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility,
robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems. Our collection

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing faces strict resource constraints which challenges traditional autoscaling methods, creating a need for more flexible scaling behaviors through multiple elasticity dimensions.

Method: An agent-based autoscaling framework was introduced and four types of scaling agents were compared: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference. This was done using two parallel real-world processing services: YOLOv8 and OpenCV.

Result: All agents achieved acceptable SLO performance with different convergence patterns. Pre-trained Deep Q Network showed benefits, structural analysis converged quickly, and deep active inference combined theory with scalability advantages.

Conclusion: The study provides evidence supporting the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling in edge environments, encouraging further research in this area.

Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource
constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple
elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling
framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service
configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained
environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q
Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two
real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual
recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve
acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q
Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly,
and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with
practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the
viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments
and encourage future work in this research direction.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm
benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more
challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LogiPlan, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' logical planning and reasoning abilities over complex relational structures. It includes three tasks: Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question. The study reveals performance gaps among models and shows that while recent models perform well on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures, which is important for applications relying on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs of relations.

Method: LogiPlan allows dynamic variation of task complexity by controlling the number of objects, relations, and minimum depth of relational chains. It encompasses three tasks: Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question. Additionally, it assesses models' self-correction capabilities.

Result: State-of-the-art models were evaluated, revealing significant performance gaps correlating with model scale and architecture. Recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results on simpler instances but struggle with more complex configurations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that there is still room for improvement in LLMs' logical planning and reasoning abilities over complex relational structures.

Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning
over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important
for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs
of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business
process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity
by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of
relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance
across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1)
Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs
meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing
models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3)
Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of
queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models'
self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their
initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1,
Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B,
O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant
performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis
demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results
on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring
deeper logical planning.

### [17] [Primender Sequence: A Novel Mathematical Construct for Testing Symbolic Inference and AI Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10585)
*Mohd Anwar Jamal Faiz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a new integer sequence combining classical primality with modular digit-based conditions. It proposes this sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The study explores a hypothesis about the sequence and designs a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test it across multiple LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is the need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic at scale.

Method: The method involves defining the Primender sequence by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular digit-based conditions. A structured prompt and evaluation framework are designed to test the hypothesis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the sequence.

Result: Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to assess model performance.

Conclusion: This work contributes a novel mathematical construct and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence
defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular
digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if
it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other
words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The
resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending
number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender
sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for
interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer
hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic
at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender
sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it,
the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We
design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis
across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying
rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the
sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis
evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to
assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct
and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning,
hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains
of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

*Henrik Sebastian Steude,Alexander Diedrich,Ingo Pill,Lukas Moddemann,Daniel Vranješ,Oliver Niggemann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a diagnostic approach for complex cyber-physical systems with minimal prior knowledge, combining a neural network-based symptom generator and a new graph diagnosis algorithm. Experiments show its effectiveness in reducing search space and including true causal components, with potential for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems usually need extensive prior knowledge which is hard to obtain.

Method: The method combines a neural network-based symptom generator using subsystem-level anomaly detection with a new graph diagnosis algorithm leveraging minimal causal relationship information between subsystems.

Result: Experiments with simulated datasets indicate that the true causal component is included in 82% of cases while reducing the search space in 73% of scenarios. Tests on the Secure Water Treatment dataset show potential for practical use.

Conclusion: The approach has potential for practical applications in large and complex cyber-physical systems where prior knowledge is limited.

Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require
extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or
comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic
approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic
understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our
method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs
subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that
leverages minimal causal relationship information between
subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments
with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the
true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while
effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional
tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's
potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's
potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical
systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeleMath, a benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs' performance in solving telecommunications-specific mathematical problems. Recent math-focused models outperform general-purpose ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of LLMs in specialized domains within telecommunications, particularly in mathematically intensive tasks.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset called TeleMath with 500 QnA pairs covering telecommunications topics. Evaluated open-source LLMs on this dataset.

Result: Math-focused LLMs perform better than general-purpose models on TeleMath.

Conclusion: Released TeleMath dataset and evaluation code to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

*Tom Westermann,Aljosha Köcher,Felix Gehlhoff*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a pipeline that converts AML models to OWL ontologies and uses Large Language Models to translate textual rules into SHACL constraints for validation, demonstrating it can semi-automatically check complex modeling rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing recommendations for proper AML modeling being informal and unverifiable within AML itself.

Method: Map AML models to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL, use Large Language Model to translate textual rules into SHACL constraints, validate these constraints against the generated ontology, and interpret the results in natural language.

Result: Demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation showing that complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked without requiring users to understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Conclusion: The introduced pipeline provides a way to formalize and verify AML modeling constraints automatically.

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet
existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as
informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated
automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a
pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped
to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model
translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated
against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation
results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is
demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex
modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to
understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a system capable of translating ASPMT programs into SMT instances so that SMT solvers can compute stable models, thus enabling reasoning about continuous changes.

Method: The system uses the ASP grounder gringo to partially ground input programs while leaving some variables for processing by the SMT solver z3.

Result: The compiler aspsmt2smt effectively handles real number computations for reasoning about continuous changes.

Conclusion: ASPMT programs can be successfully turned into SMT instances allowing SMT solvers to compute their stable models.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining
answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the
functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT
programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to
compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler
called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP
grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds
input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We
demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for
reasoning about continuous changes.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge and significantly outperforms existing models. On the CRAFT benchmark, the method further improves performance on counterfactual questions.

Conclusion: Enhancing neuro-symbolic models with causal graphs and ASP improves counterfactual reasoning. Using large pre-trained language models can also boost performance on certain benchmarks.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem.
While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based
perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations,
especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a
method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning,
leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define
the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set
Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to
coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of
our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly
outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage
a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a
dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its
performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts

Conclusion: The study concludes that leveraging historical feedback during iterative optimization significantly boosts LLMs' performance. All datasets, code, and tools are open-sourced to encourage further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving
diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex

environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution
refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an
end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling
complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions
through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9
state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of
optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on
solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating
historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning
research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from
high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While
large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face
challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition,
lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies.
This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating
spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The
methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage
cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP
tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental
perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation.
Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's
effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high
similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores
of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments

Conclusion: ToxiMol provides the first benchmark for molecular toxicity repair, revealing both the potential and limitations of current MLLMs in this area.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

TL;DR: The paper explores reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in eliciting strong mathematical reasoning, particularly in Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. It demonstrates significant performance improvements even with spurious rewards and highlights the unique code reasoning behavior of Qwen models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how RLVR can enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities in large language models, especially when using spurious rewards that have little to no correlation with correct answers.

Method: Employed RLVR on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model with various types of spurious rewards (random, format, incorrect label, 1-shot RL, majority voting) and compared its performance against ground truth rewards.

Result: Observed substantial improvements in MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B using spurious rewards, nearly matching the gains from ground truth rewards. Noted a distinctive increase in code reasoning behavior specific to Qwen models.

Conclusion: The study suggests that RLVR may uncover useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining despite lack of useful reward signals. Future research should validate RLVR across diverse models rather than focusing solely on one model family.

Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit
strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that
have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For
example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute
points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect
label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the
29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work
for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or
OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual
code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes
significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with
spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward
signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned
during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future
work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on
diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy
to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely
spurious reward signals.

### [28] [Leveraging Pre-Trained Models for Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning under Adaptive Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09999)
*Yukun Chen,Zihuan Qiu,Fanman Meng,Hongliang Li,Linfeng Xu,Qingbo Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) across vision, audio, and text modalities. It introduces MIFE, AAVFM, a novel contrastive training loss, and two evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MCIL methods mainly focus on vision and text, lacking exploration in integrating audio modality and facing challenges of catastrophic forgetting.

Method: The method consists of four key components: 1) Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on MoE structure for fine-tuning AudioCLIP; 2) Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) with masking threshold and dynamic feature fusion mechanisms; 3) A multimodal class-incremental contrastive training loss for optimizing cross-modal alignment; 4) Two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics.

Result: The proposed method has been validated through extensive experiments on three multimodal datasets, showing its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This work successfully addresses the challenges in MCIL across vision, audio, and text modalities by proposing an effective method that enhances feature discriminability and generalization, mitigates catastrophic forgetting, and provides comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Unlike traditional Multimodal Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) methods that
focus only on vision and text, this paper explores MCIL across vision, audio
and text modalities, addressing challenges in integrating complementary
information and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To tackle these issues, we
propose an MCIL method based on multimodal pre-trained models. Firstly, a
Multimodal Incremental Feature Extractor (MIFE) based on Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) structure is introduced to achieve effective incremental fine-tuning for
AudioCLIP. Secondly, to enhance feature discriminability and generalization, we
propose an Adaptive Audio-Visual Fusion Module (AAVFM) that includes a masking
threshold mechanism and a dynamic feature fusion mechanism, along with a
strategy to enhance text diversity. Thirdly, a novel multimodal
class-incremental contrastive training loss is proposed to optimize cross-modal
alignment in MCIL. Finally, two MCIL-specific evaluation metrics are introduced
for comprehensive assessment. Extensive experiments on three multimodal
datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

*Wei Li,Mengcheng Lan,Jiaxing Xu,Yiping Ke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graphs are crucial for modeling complex interactions but traditional methods have limitations. NOCL, a new framework leveraging node description and node concept techniques, addresses these issues and demonstrates superior generalization in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional Graph Neural Networks and self-supervised approaches that still require labeled fine-tuning, as well as to extend the capabilities of Large Language Models when applied to graphs.

Method: Propose NOCL with two core techniques: node description (converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured natural language) and node concept (encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings). Also employs graph representation descriptors to unify graph tasks.

Result: Validates NOCL's competitive supervised performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods, and shows superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: NOCL provides a novel approach to handle graph data by leveraging language models, demonstrating effectiveness in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Graphs are essential for modeling complex interactions across domains such as
social networks, biology, and recommendation systems. Traditional Graph Neural
Networks, particularly Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), rely heavily on
supervised learning, limiting their generalization and applicability in
label-scarce scenarios. Recent self-supervised approaches still require labeled
fine-tuning, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Meanwhile,
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face
significant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning
abilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and
being limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM
(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node
description, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured
natural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which
encodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained
language models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared
to directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph
representation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a
shared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph
Foundation Models. Experimental results validate NOCL's competitive supervised
performance relative to traditional MPNNs and hybrid LLM-MPNN methods and
demonstrate superior generalization in zero-shot settings.

### [30] [Improving the performance of optical inverse design of multilayer thin films using CNN-LSTM tandem neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10044)
*Uijun Jung,Deokho Jang,Sungchul Kim,Jungho Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of deep learning, specifically a tandem neural network (TNN) with different algorithm configurations (MLP, CNN, LSTM), for the inverse design of transmission spectra in SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. The study finds that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN offers the highest accuracy but longest training time, while a CNN-LSTM-based TNN provides a good balance between accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for inverse design of thin film optical properties are time-consuming due to extensive numerical simulations and optimization procedures.

Method: The paper utilizes deep learning through a tandem neural network (TNN). This TNN is composed of an inverse neural network and a pre-trained forward neural network connected back-to-back. Different algorithms including MLP, CNN, and LSTM are incorporated into the TNN configuration to solve one-to-many mapping problems.

Result: An LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but requires the longest training time among nine TNN configurations. A CNN-LSTM-based TNN is found to be optimal for balancing accuracy and speed by leveraging strengths of both CNN and LSTM algorithms.

Conclusion: Deep learning using TNN with specific algorithm configurations can effectively predict the thicknesses and optical properties of thin films for inverse design, with CNN-LSTM providing a well-rounded solution.

Abstract: Optical properties of thin film are greatly influenced by the thickness of
each layer. Accurately predicting these thicknesses and their corresponding
optical properties is important in the optical inverse design of thin films.
However, traditional inverse design methods usually demand extensive numerical
simulations and optimization procedures, which are time-consuming. In this
paper, we utilize deep learning for the inverse design of the transmission
spectra of SiO2/TiO2 multilayer thin films. We implement a tandem neural
network (TNN), which can solve the one-to-many mapping problem that greatly
degrades the performance of deep-learning-based inverse designs. In general,
the TNN has been implemented by a back-to-back connection of an inverse neural
network and a pre-trained forward neural network, both of which have been
implemented based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms. In this paper, we
propose to use not only MLP, but also convolutional neural network (CNN) or
long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms in the configuration of the TNN. We
show that an LSTM-LSTM-based TNN yields the highest accuracy but takes the
longest training time among nine configurations of TNNs. We also find that a
CNN-LSTM-based TNN will be an optimal solution in terms of accuracy and speed
because it could integrate the strengths of the CNN and LSTM algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omni-DPO is a new dual-perspective optimization framework that improves reinforcement learning from human feedback by adaptively weighting samples based on data quality and model learning dynamics. It shows superior performance in textual understanding and mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO-based approaches treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance.

Method: Propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that considers both the inherent quality of each preference pair and the model's evolving performance on those pairs, and adaptively weights samples during training.

Result: On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats Claude 3 Opus by a margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms baseline methods across all benchmarks.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance, demonstrating superiority and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在解决现实世界任务方面越来越强大，但对其不确定性进行准确量化仍然是一个关键的开放性问题。本文通过贝叶斯视角看待基于LLM的系统，将提示词解释为统计模型中的文本参数，并引入MHLP算法进行贝叶斯推断。实验表明，该方法提高了预测准确性和不确定性量化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，许多最先进的LLM是封闭源码、黑箱性质的，且对提示词高度敏感，这使得准确量化其不确定性变得困难，限制了其在高风险领域的应用。

Method: 将提示词视为统计模型中的文本参数，利用小型训练数据集对这些提示词执行贝叶斯推断，提出了一种新的马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）算法——Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals（MHLP），结合提示词优化技术和标准MCMC方法。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法在一系列LLM基准测试和不确定性量化任务中，提高了预测准确性和不确定性量化效果。

Conclusion: 本文工作展示了将贝叶斯方法纳入LLM时代的一条可行路径，为构建更可靠、更校准的LLM系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of
solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty
remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in
high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,
black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can
be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require
significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address
these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We
interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to
use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.
This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both
the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also
incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.
To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data
modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a
novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt
optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey
modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively
on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields
improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on
a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a
viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into
the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based
systems.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning,
particularly for safety-critical applications where unexpected inputs must be
reliably flagged. While hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs) offer
improved representational capacity over traditional VAEs, their performance is
highly sensitive to how latent dimensions are distributed across layers.
Existing approaches often allocate latent capacity arbitrarily, leading to
ineffective representations or posterior collapse. In this work, we introduce a
theoretically grounded framework for optimizing latent dimension allocation in
HVAEs, drawing on principles from information theory to formalize the trade-off
between information loss and representational attenuation. We prove the
existence of an optimal allocation ratio $r^{\ast}$ under a fixed latent
budget, and empirically show that tuning this ratio consistently improves OOD
detection performance across datasets and architectures. Our approach
outperforms baseline HVAE configurations and provides practical guidance for
principled latent structure design, leading to more robust OOD detection with
deep generative models.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a kernelized bandit problem with a compact arm set ${X} \subset
\mathbb{R}^d $ and a fixed but unknown reward function $f^*$ with a finite norm
in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose a class of
computationally efficient kernelized bandit algorithms, which we call
GP-Generic, based on a novel concept: exploration distributions. This class of
algorithms includes Upper Confidence Bound-based approaches as a special case,
but also allows for a variety of randomized algorithms. With careful choice of
exploration distribution, our proposed generic algorithm realizes a wide range
of concrete algorithms that achieve $\tilde{O}(\gamma_T\sqrt{T})$ regret
bounds, where $\gamma_T$ characterizes the RKHS complexity. This matches known
results for UCB- and Thompson Sampling-based algorithms; we also show that in
practice, randomization can yield better practical results.

Conclusion: The approach creates a dependable base that helps deploy unsupervised representation learning in different large-scale image clustering applications.

Abstract: This research implements an advanced unsupervised clustering system for MNIST
handwritten digits through two-phase deep autoencoder architecture. A deep
neural autoencoder requires a training process during phase one to develop
minimal yet interpretive representations of images by minimizing reconstruction

TL;DR: A novel federated multi-task learning method leveraging cross-client similarity for personalized learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable personalized learning in a communication-efficient manner by leveraging cross-client similarity.

Method: Introduce a feature anchor to summarize local features and share classification heads with graph-based regularization. Model client collaboration as a dynamic graph updated via community detection.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on two heterogeneous datasets, superior computation and communication efficiency, promotes fairness.

Conclusion: The proposed method achieves effective personalized learning with high efficiency and fairness.

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages
cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To
avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a
communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact
vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's
local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for
local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification
heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to
enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients
as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can
account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer
and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based
approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,
maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'
weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to
highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive
interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two
heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits
superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across
clients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs associated with simulating complex natural objects such as cloud formation.

Method: Propose Nonnegative Diffusion (NnD), a learned generative model that uses score-based diffusion and adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce non-negativity during iterative scene generation and analysis. The model trains on high-quality physically simulated objects.

Result: Successfully generated 3D volumetric clouds with nonnegative microphysical fields that align with cloud physics trends and appear physically realistic to experts.

Conclusion: NnD offers a computationally efficient method for generating physically meaningful, nonnegative objects.

Abstract: Most natural objects have inherent complexity and variability. While some
simple objects can be modeled from first principles, many real-world phenomena,
such as cloud formation, require computationally expensive simulations that
limit scalability. This work focuses on a class of physically meaningful,
nonnegative objects that are computationally tractable but costly to simulate.
To dramatically reduce computational costs, we propose nonnegative diffusion
(NnD). This is a learned generative model using score based diffusion. It
adapts annealed Langevin dynamics to enforce, by design, non-negativity
throughout iterative scene generation and analysis (inference). NnD trains on
high-quality physically simulated objects. Once trained, it can be used for
generation and inference. We demonstrate generation of 3D volumetric clouds,
comprising inherently nonnegative microphysical fields. Our generated clouds
are consistent with cloud physics trends. They are effectively not
distinguished as non-physical by expert perception.

Motivation: Existing graph AL methods are often evaluated on static datasets with a primary focus on prediction accuracy, ignoring important aspects like sampling diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic environments.

Method: GRAIL introduces new metrics to evaluate sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden of graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments.

Result: Experiments on dynamic human sensor data show trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, pointing out limitations in current AL strategies.

Conclusion: GRAIL emphasizes the need to balance node importance, query diversity, and network topology for effective graph AL in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to
efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden
in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor
networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes
data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a
valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph
AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on
prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling
diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this
gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel
metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling
a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive
experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal
trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting
limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of
balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an
evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Abstract: We study the decentralized multi-player multi-armed bandits (MMAB) problem
under a no-sensing setting, where each player receives only their own reward
and obtains no information about collisions. Each arm has an unknown capacity,
and if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players
involved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical
unit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity
discovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm
for Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a
decentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized
regime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol
that enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation
through carefully structured collision patterns. This represents a provably

Motivation: 强化学习代理在从模拟部署到现实世界时常常遇到困难。领域随机化（DR）是一种减少模拟到现实差距的策略，但标准DR未利用真实系统已有的离线数据。为了解决这个问题，本文研究了离线领域随机化（ODR）。

Method: (i) 将ODR形式化为参数化模拟器族的最大似然估计；(ii) 在温和的规律性和可识别性条件下证明该估计量的一致性；(iii) 推导差距界限，表明ODR的模拟到现实误差比均匀DR更紧；(iv) 引入E-DROPO，这是DROPO的一个新版本，增加了熵奖金以防止方差崩溃，从而实现更广泛的随机化和更强的零样本迁移。

Abstract: Reinforcement-learning agents often struggle when deployed from simulation to
the real-world. A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain
randomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by
sampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already
available from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),
which first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline
dataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with
algorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood
estimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this
estimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it
converges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds
demonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than
uniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous
setting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an
entropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and
more robust zero-shot transfer in practice.

Motivation: 目前的目标条件行为克隆（GCBC）方法虽然在训练任务上表现良好，但对需要组合泛化的新型状态-目标对的任务缺乏零样本泛化能力。这归因于行为克隆中学到的状态表示缺乏时间一致性。如果相关时间状态被编码为相似的潜在表示，则可以缩小对于新状态-目标对的分布外差距。

Method: 提出了一种名为BYOL-γ增强GCBC的新表示学习目标，该目标在有限MDP情况下理论上能够逼近继承者表示，而无需对比样本或时间差分（TD）学习。继承者表示用于编码从当前状态出发访问未来状态的分布，具有良好的时间一致性特性。

Result: 在一系列需要组合泛化的挑战性任务中，该方法展示了与现有方法相当的经验性能。

Conclusion: BYOL-γ增强GCBC提供了一种简单且有效的方法来促进组合泛化，通过学习具有时间一致性的状态表示，提升了对新状态-目标对的泛化能力。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an
effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like
robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy
to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While
goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on
in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to
tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial
generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of
temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally
related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the
out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,
encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should
facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which
encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely
encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor
representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)
learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which
is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in
the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,
results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging
tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究人员部分逆向解析了一个通过无模型强化学习训练的卷积递归神经网络（RNN），该网络用于玩解谜游戏Sokoban。分析揭示了其解决难题的机制与经典双向搜索组件类似，但也有不同之处。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管已知此网络在测试时使用更多计算资源能解决更多关卡，但具体内部机制尚不清楚，因此需要对其进行逆向工程以理解其工作原理。

Method: 对一个通过无模型强化学习训练的卷积RNN进行部分逆向工程。分析每个方格在特定方向上的计划表示、专用内核如何扩展这些表示以形成路径，以及状态表示和价值函数的作用。

Result: 发现RNN中存在类似于经典双向搜索的机制，例如计划表示、价值函数和过渡模型。此外，还发现了不同于经典搜索的特点，如状态表示的非统一性和每层独立的计划表示。

Conclusion: 通过无模型训练学习到的利用测试时间计算的机制可以被用熟悉的术语理解，表明此类神经网络并非完全不可解释。

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN)
trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning.
Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time
compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of
classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in
the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These
state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes
determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized
kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and
backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also
unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified;
instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan
representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being
inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this
network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces three novel survival models (iSurvM, iSurvQ, and iSurvJ) that combine imprecise probability theory with attention mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional survival analysis methods struggle with complex data structures and heavy censoring.

Method: The models represent censored observations by interval-valued probability distributions, employ kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson regression with trainable attention weights, and consider three decision strategies for training.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, outperform the Beran estimator in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The proposed survival models provide effective solutions for handling censored data and are publicly available.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a fundamental tool for modeling time-to-event data in
healthcare, engineering, and finance, where censored observations pose
significant challenges. While traditional methods like the Beran estimator
offer nonparametric solutions, they often struggle with the complex data
structures and heavy censoring. This paper introduces three novel survival
models, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood
functions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of
likelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the
Joint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention
mechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions. The first
idea behind the models is to represent censored observations by interval-valued
probability distributions for each instance over time intervals between events
moments. The second idea is to employ the kernel-based Nadaraya-Watson
regression with trainable attention weights for computing the imprecise
probability distribution over time intervals for the entire dataset. The third
idea is to consider three decision strategies for training, which correspond to
the proposed three models. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed models, especially iSurvJ, consistently
outperform the Beran estimator from the accuracy and computational complexity
points of view. Codes implementing the proposed models are publicly available.

*Yaowen Zhang,Libera Fresiello,Peter H. Veltink,Dirk W. Donker,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于生理模型的神经网络（PMB-NN）框架，用于根据日常体力活动中的氧气摄取量（VO2）数据估计心率（HR）。通过嵌入简化的生理模型约束，该框架在实现高精度HR估计的同时符合人体生理原则。实验结果表明，PMB-NN模型性能优于传统生理模型，并与基准神经网络模型相当，为个性化和实时心脏监测提供了可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心力衰竭（HF）是全球健康的重大挑战，早期检测能够改善预后。心率异常，尤其是在日常活动中，可能是HF风险的早期指标。然而，现有的HR监测工具依赖于人群平均值，缺乏个体化精确性。当前的HR估计方法要么效率低，要么难以解释。

Method: 研究引入了基于氧气摄取量（VO2）数据的生理模型驱动神经网络（PMB-NN）框架。通过将从简化的生理模型中得出的生理约束嵌入到神经网络训练过程中，确保模型遵循人体生理原则。使用12名参与者在休息、骑车和跑步等活动中收集的个体数据集进行训练和测试。

Result: PMB-NN模型实现了中位数R²得分为0.8，均方根误差（RMSE）为8.3 bpm的高估测精度。统计分析显示，PMB-NN模型的表现与基准神经网络模型相当，但显著优于传统生理模型（p=0.002）。此外，PMB-NN能够识别个性化参数，使简化的人体运动生理模型生成合理的HR估计。

Conclusion: 基于生理模型的神经网络框架结合了生理学原理和机器学习的优势，可以提供个体化的HR估计，为未来日常生活中个性化和实时的心脏监测系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Heart failure (HF) poses a significant global health challenge, with early
detection offering opportunities for improved outcomes. Abnormalities in heart
rate (HR), particularly during daily activities, may serve as early indicators
of HF risk. However, existing HR monitoring tools for HF detection are limited
by their reliability on population-based averages. The estimation of
individualized HR serves as a dynamic digital twin, enabling precise tracking
of cardiac health biomarkers. Current HR estimation methods, categorized into
physiologically-driven and purely data-driven models, struggle with efficiency
and interpretability. This study introduces a novel physiological-model-based
neural network (PMB-NN) framework for HR estimation based on oxygen uptake
(VO2) data during daily physical activities. The framework was trained and
tested on individual datasets from 12 participants engaged in activities
including resting, cycling, and running. By embedding physiological
constraints, which were derived from our proposed simplified human movement
physiological model (PM), into the neural network training process, the PMB-NN
model adheres to human physiological principles while achieving high estimation
accuracy, with a median R$^2$ score of 0.8 and an RMSE of 8.3 bpm. Comparative
statistical analysis demonstrates that the PMB-NN achieves performance on par
with the benchmark neural network model while significantly outperforming
traditional physiological model (p=0.002). In addition, our PMB-NN is adept at
identifying personalized parameters of the PM, enabling the PM to generate
reasonable HR estimation. The proposed framework with a precise VO2 estimation
system derived from body movements enables the future possibilities of
personalized and real-time cardiac monitoring during daily life physical
activities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Balanced Hyperbolic Learning with a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm to optimize hierarchical distortion and balancing, using hyperbolic prototypes for classification. It outperforms existing methods in out-of-distribution recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Out-of-distribution recognition is crucial in deep learning to filter out samples not belonging to the trained distribution. The paper aims to improve discrimination between in- and out-of-distribution samples.

Method: Introduction of Balanced Hyperbolic Learning which includes a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that optimizes hierarchical distortion and balance between shallow and wide subhierarchies. Hyperbolic prototypes are used for classification on in-distribution data and existing out-of-distribution scoring functions are generalized to work with these prototypes.

Result: Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions show that the proposed hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution approaches, other hyperbolic methods, and state-of-the-art contrastive methods. They also enable hierarchical out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: A good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that adds a KL divergence regularizer to contrastive learning methods, enabling probabilistic embeddings and uncertainty quantification. Experiments show VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information, matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, and provides meaningful uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning methods lack a principled mechanism for uncertainty quantification.

Method: The authors propose Variational Contrastive Learning (VCL), which maximizes the evidence lower bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit hypersphere. The approximate posterior is modeled as a projected normal distribution, allowing sampling of probabilistic embeddings.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that VCL mitigates dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior model.

Conclusion: VCL equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation, serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

Abstract: Deterministic embeddings learned by contrastive learning (CL) methods such as
SimCLR and SupCon achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack a principled
mechanism for uncertainty quantification. We propose Variational Contrastive
Learning (VCL), a decoder-free framework that maximizes the evidence lower
bound (ELBO) by interpreting the InfoNCE loss as a surrogate reconstruction
term and adding a KL divergence regularizer to a uniform prior on the unit
hypersphere. We model the approximate posterior $q_\theta(z|x)$ as a projected
normal distribution, enabling the sampling of probabilistic embeddings. Our two
instantiations--VSimCLR and VSupCon--replace deterministic embeddings with
samples from $q_\theta(z|x)$ and incorporate a normalized KL term into the
loss. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VCL mitigates
dimensional collapse, enhances mutual information with class labels, and
matches or outperforms deterministic baselines in classification accuracy, all
the while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates through the posterior
model. VCL thus equips contrastive learning with a probabilistic foundation,
serving as a new basis for contrastive approaches.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC), which uses a pessimistic actor and an optimistic actor to improve sample efficiency in environments with sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms are leading in continuous control reinforcement learning but suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in sparse reward environments.

Method: Propose WBSAC algorithm that leverages a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor for exploration. The Wasserstein barycenter of these two policies is used as the exploration policy, adjusting exploration degree during learning.

Result: WBSAC shows more sample-efficiency than state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: WBSAC addresses the issue of poor sample efficiency in deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms through its directed exploration strategy.

Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework
for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of
these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments
with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this
issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose
Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from
a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to
promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of
the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting
the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC
with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is
more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

*Defang Chen,Zhenyu Zhou,Can Wang,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion-based generative models show a geometric regularity in sampling dynamics where trajectories form an almost identical 'boomerang' shape in low-dimensional subspaces. This paper explores this phenomenon, its properties under closed-form solutions, and proposes a dynamic programming-based scheme to improve sampling time schedule alignment for better image generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and leverage the geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion-based generative models for improved performance.

Method: The authors analyze the geometric properties of sampling trajectories in diffusion-based generative models and propose a dynamic programming-based scheme to align the sampling time schedule with the trajectory structure.

Result: The proposed method achieves superior image generation performance with minimal modifications to existing solvers and negligible computational overhead, particularly effective with limited function evaluations.

Conclusion: The discovery of geometric regularity in sampling trajectories can lead to more efficient and effective diffusion-based generative models through simple adjustments in the sampling process.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D
molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D
molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However,
specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such
equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent
SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A
non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned
representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs
significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields
sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and
offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DynaSubVAE is a framework that performs representation learning and adaptive OOD detection, evolving with data by updating latent structures and using non-parametric clustering to model subgroups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world observational data often contain heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns, which are overlooked by the majority of models leading to inaccurate predictions.

Method: DynaSubVAE jointly performs representation learning and adaptive OOD detection. It dynamically updates its latent structure to capture new trends and leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism inspired by Gaussian Mixture Models to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding similarity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive performance in near-OOD and far-OOD detection, excelling particularly in class-OOD scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. The dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone clustering methods like GMM and KMeans++ in terms of OOD accuracy and regret precision.

Conclusion: DynaSubVAE provides a solution for capturing emerging patterns in data through its dynamic latent structure and clustering mechanism, showing strong performance in various OOD detection tasks.

Abstract: Real-world observational data often contain existing or emerging
heterogeneous subpopulations that deviate from global patterns. The majority of
models tend to overlook these underrepresented groups, leading to inaccurate or
even harmful predictions. Existing solutions often rely on detecting these
samples as Out-of-domain (OOD) rather than adapting the model to new emerging
patterns. We introduce DynaSubVAE, a Dynamic Subgrouping Variational
Autoencoder framework that jointly performs representation learning and
adaptive OOD detection. Unlike conventional approaches, DynaSubVAE evolves with
the data by dynamically updating its latent structure to capture new trends. It
leverages a novel non-parametric clustering mechanism, inspired by Gaussian
Mixture Models, to discover and model latent subgroups based on embedding
similarity. Extensive experiments show that DynaSubVAE achieves competitive
performance in both near-OOD and far-OOD detection, and excels in class-OOD
scenarios where an entire class is missing during training. We further
illustrate that our dynamic subgrouping mechanism outperforms standalone
clustering methods such as GMM and KMeans++ in terms of both OOD accuracy and
regret precision.

Conclusion: AWP offers a superior approach for compressing Large Language Models through quantization and pruning, supported by both experimental evidence and theoretical analysis.

Abstract: To address the enormous size of Large Language Models (LLMs), model
compression methods, such as quantization and pruning, are often deployed,
especially on edge devices. In this work, we focus on layer-wise post-training
quantization and pruning. Drawing connections between activation-aware weight
pruning and sparse approximation problems, and motivated by the success of
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), we propose a unified method for
Activation-aware Weight pruning and quantization via Projected gradient descent
(AWP). Our experiments demonstrate that AWP outperforms state-of-the-art LLM
pruning and quantization methods. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the
proposed method for pruning are also provided.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores the common and exclusive characteristics of ECG and PCG using a dataset of simultaneous recordings during rest and exercise. Nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving more feasible than the reverse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate the common and exclusive characteristics of ECG and PCG signals, as well as their potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, especially under varying physiological conditions and across individuals.

Method: Employed linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise.

Result: Nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provided superior reconstruction performance. Reconstructing ECG from PCG was more feasible than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios presented significant challenges but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous amplitude features improved cross-subject generalizability for cross-modal learning. Clinically relevant ECG biomarkers could be estimated from PCG in cross-subject settings.

Conclusion: The findings advance our understanding of the relationship between electromechanical cardiac modalities, with potential applications in novel multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a
comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the
heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the
distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their
potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains
incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and
across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive
characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous
ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and
nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to
reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of
causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results
demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide
superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving
more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present
significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous
amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for
cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG
biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG
in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between
electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics
and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel
multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

*Chen-Chia Chang,Wan-Hsuan Lin,Yikang Shen,Yiran Chen,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LaMAGIC2 is a new framework for analog topology generation that improves upon previous methods by introducing SFCI, which enhances component-type recognition, reduces token length complexity and improves numeric precision sensitivity. Experiments show LaMAGIC2 achieves higher success rates, lower MSEs and better transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized requirements and heavy manual engineering efforts in modern applications.

Method: LaMAGIC2 uses a succinct float-input canonical formulation with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation. It improves component-type recognition through identifier-based representations, reduces token length complexity to O(|V|), and enhances numeric precision sensitivity.

Result: LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a prior method. It also exhibits up to 58.5% improvement in transferability for circuits with more vertices.

Conclusion: LaMAGIC2 establishes itself as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized
requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts.
The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and
supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user
specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2)
token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In
this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation
with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation.
SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through
identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |),
and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight
tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher
success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a
prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with
more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish
LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

*Yuji Kawamata,Kaoru Kamijo,Maki Kihira,Akihiro Toyoda,Tomoru Nakayama,Akira Imakura,Tetsuya Sakurai,Yukihiko Okada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DC-Clustering, a novel federated clustering method that supports complex data partitioning scenarios in federated learning while preserving privacy and achieving performance comparable to centralized clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated clustering methods can only handle simple data partitioning scenarios like horizontal or vertical splits, but cannot manage more complex distributed structures where both types of splits coexist.

Method: DC-Clustering is introduced, which allows institutions to share intermediate representations instead of raw data. It supports flexible selection between k-means and spectral clustering algorithms and achieves final clustering results with a single round of communication with the central server.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate that DC-Clustering achieves clustering performance comparable to centralized clustering methods where all data are pooled together.

Conclusion: DC-Clustering fills an important gap in federated learning research by enabling effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data, making it suitable for privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance due to its properties of privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and flexibility.

Abstract: In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across
institutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a
decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without
sharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as
federated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such
as horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed
structures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),
a novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data
partitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In
DC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations
instead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative
clustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral
clustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication
with the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and
open benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering
performance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.
DC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling
effective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its
practical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and
flexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare and finance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种元学习方法，用于从多个嘈杂注释者中学习。通过嵌入神经网络和EM算法，该方法能够有效地利用不同但相关的任务中标记的数据，改善分类器的测试分类性能，并在现实世界的数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在众包服务等应用中，监督学习的标签由多个注释者给出，但由于注释者的技能或偏差不同，所给标签可能存在噪声。现有方法需要大量嘈杂的标注数据来学习准确的分类器，但在实践中可能无法获得足够的数据。

Method: 提出的方法使用在不同但相关任务中获得的标记数据。通过神经网络将每个任务中的示例嵌入到潜在空间，并构建概率模型以学习特定于任务的分类器，同时在潜在空间中估计注释者的能力。分类器适应过程通过最大化后验概率使用EM算法进行。由于EM算法的每一步都可以轻松计算为闭合形式并且是可微分的，因此该方法可以有效地通过EM算法反向传播损失以元学习神经网络。

Result: 在具有合成噪声的真实世界数据集和真实世界的众包数据集上展示了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的元学习方法能够有效利用相关任务中标记的数据，通过EM算法进行分类器适应并提高测试分类性能。这表明该方法在处理小规模标注数据时具有潜力。

Abstract: We propose a meta-learning method for learning from multiple noisy
annotators. In many applications such as crowdsourcing services, labels for
supervised learning are given by multiple annotators. Since the annotators have
different skills or biases, given labels can be noisy. To learn accurate
classifiers, existing methods require many noisy annotated data. However,
sufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,
the proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.
The proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a
neural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a
task-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent
space. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test
classification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small
amount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing
the posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
Since each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is
differentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss
through the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network. We show the
effectiveness of our method with real-world datasets with synthetic noise and
real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

*Ryota Ueda,Takami Sato,Ken Kobayashi,Kazuhide Nakata*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation is effective for neural network verification but faces challenges in deep networks due to interior-point vanishing. This study proposes five solutions to enhance feasibility conditions, successfully solving more problems and revealing issues with traditional constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical limitation of SDP relaxation in deep neural network verification, specifically the issue of interior-point vanishing which leads to loss of strict feasibility as network depth increases.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of increasing DNN depth on strict feasibility. Design and investigation of five solutions to improve feasibility conditions. Evaluation of traditional constraints on ReLU units' bounds.

Result: 88% of previously unsolvable problems were resolved by the proposed methods, covering 41% of the total problems. It was found that traditional constraints on ReLU bounds are not beneficial and can harm feasibility.

Conclusion: This work highlights fundamental challenges in SDP-based DNN verification and provides practical solutions to extend its applicability to deeper networks, advancing reliable and secure DNN systems.

Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation has emerged as a promising approach
for neural network verification, offering tighter bounds than other convex
relaxation methods for deep neural networks (DNNs) with ReLU activations.
However, we identify a critical limitation in the SDP relaxation when applied
to deep networks: interior-point vanishing, which leads to the loss of strict
feasibility -- a crucial condition for the numerical stability and optimality
of SDP. Through rigorous theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate
that as the depth of DNNs increases, the strict feasibility is likely to be
lost, creating a fundamental barrier to scaling SDP-based verification. To
address the interior-point vanishing, we design and investigate five solutions
to enhance the feasibility conditions of the verification problem. Our methods
can successfully solve 88% of the problems that could not be solved by existing
methods, accounting for 41% of the total. Our analysis also reveals that the
valid constraints for the lower and upper bounds for each ReLU unit are
traditionally inherited from prior work without solid reasons, but are actually
not only unbeneficial but also even harmful to the problem's feasibility. This
work provides valuable insights into the fundamental challenges of SDP-based
DNN verification and offers practical solutions to improve its applicability to
deeper neural networks, contributing to the development of more reliable and
secure systems with DNNs.

*Jiajin Liu,Dongzhe Fan,Jiacheng Shen,Chuanhao Ji,Daochen Zha,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have great capabilities but often overlook structural relationships. Integrating multimodality with structured graph information is essential for real-world applications. Existing methods leverage MLLMs in three ways: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor. However, the field lacks a unified benchmark. This paper presents Graph-MLLM, which evaluates these approaches across six datasets. Experiments show that jointly considering visual and textual attributes benefits graph learning, converting visual attributes into textual descriptions improves performance, and fine-tuning MLLMs on specific MMGs achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of current MLLMs that focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while overlooking structural relationships and to provide a unified benchmark for evaluating different approaches in multimodal graph learning.

Method: The authors systematically evaluate three paradigms of leveraging MLLMs in multimodal graph learning: MLLM-as-Encoder, MLLM-as-Aligner, and MLLM-as-Predictor across six datasets with different domains using their proposed comprehensive benchmark Graph-MLLM.

Result: Jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of nodes benefits graph learning. Converting visual attributes into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly using visual inputs. Fine-tuning MLLMs on specific MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios even without explicit graph structure information.

Conclusion: The authors hope that their open-sourced library will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in multimodal graph learning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in representing and understanding diverse modalities. However,
they typically focus on modality alignment in a pairwise manner while
overlooking structural relationships across data points. Integrating
multimodality with structured graph information (i.e., multimodal graphs, MMGs)
is essential for real-world applications such as social networks, healthcare,
and recommendation systems. Existing MMG learning methods fall into three
paradigms based on how they leverage MLLMs: Encoder, Aligner, and Predictor.
MLLM-as-Encoder focuses on enhancing graph neural networks (GNNs) via
multimodal feature fusion; MLLM-as-Aligner aligns multimodal attributes in
language or hidden space to enable LLM-based graph reasoning; MLLM-as-Predictor
treats MLLMs as standalone reasoners with in-context learning or fine-tuning.
Despite their advances, the MMG field lacks a unified benchmark to fairly
evaluate across these approaches, making it unclear what progress has been
made. To bridge this gap, we present Graph-MLLM, a comprehensive benchmark for
multimodal graph learning by systematically evaluating these three paradigms
across six datasets with different domains. Through extensive experiments, we
observe that jointly considering the visual and textual attributes of the nodes
benefits graph learning, even when using pre-trained text-to-image alignment
models (e.g., CLIP) as encoders. We also find that converting visual attributes
into textual descriptions further improves performance compared to directly
using visual inputs. Moreover, we observe that fine-tuning MLLMs on specific
MMGs can achieve state-of-the-art results in most scenarios, even without
explicit graph structure information. We hope that our open-sourced library
will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative
research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分组设置中，多个组具有重叠的可行动作集，目标是最小化跨组的最大后悔（协作后悔）。标准算法可能导致组间探索成本显著不平衡，因此需要一种新方法来平衡组间的探索负担。

Method: 引入了一种名为Col-UCB的算法，该算法动态地协调组间的探索过程，同时考虑组间共享奖励观测的情况。

Result: Col-UCB算法实现了最优的极小极大后悔和实例相关协作后悔，仅相差对数因子。这些边界适应于组间共享动作集的结构，揭示了合作相对于各组独立学习的优势。

Conclusion: 通过动态协调组间探索，Col-UCB算法能够在分组多臂老虎机问题中有效地最小化协作后悔，并提供了关于何时合作优于独立学习的见解。

Abstract: We study the impact of sharing exploration in multi-armed bandits in a
grouped setting where a set of groups have overlapping feasible action sets
[Baek and Farias '24]. In this grouped bandit setting, groups share reward
observations, and the objective is to minimize the collaborative regret,
defined as the maximum regret across groups. This naturally captures
applications in which one aims to balance the exploration burden between groups
or populations -- it is known that standard algorithms can lead to
significantly imbalanced exploration cost between groups. We address this
problem by introducing an algorithm Col-UCB that dynamically coordinates
exploration across groups. We show that Col-UCB achieves both optimal minimax
and instance-dependent collaborative regret up to logarithmic factors. These
bounds are adaptive to the structure of shared action sets between groups,
providing insights into when collaboration yields significant benefits over
each group learning their best action independently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning methods for detecting malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia rely on stylistic and meta-data features but lack adaptability to author-specific behaviours, leading to challenges in modeling specific sockpuppet-groups effectively, particularly when text data is limited.

Method: The paper applies meta-learning, which is designed to enhance performance in data-scarce settings by training across multiple tasks. This technique optimises the model's ability to rapidly adapt to the writing style of new sockpuppet-groups.

Result: Meta-learning significantly improves the precision of predictions compared to pre-trained models, demonstrating its effectiveness in combating sockpuppetry on open editing platforms like Wikipedia.

Conclusion: Meta-learning offers an advancement in the detection of malicious sockpuppets on Wikipedia. The authors also contribute to the field by releasing a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to encourage further research.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

TL;DR: PyLO is a PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine learning community, with a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in learned optimizers remain largely inaccessible to the broader community due to reliance on JAX and absence of user-friendly packages for applying the optimizers after meta-training.

Method: Introduction of PyLO, a PyTorch-based library that includes a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture and allows combination with existing optimization tools.

Result: Delivers substantial speedups from 39.36 to 205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32 when using learned optimizers combined with existing optimization tools.

Conclusion: Learned optimizers can substantially benefit when combined with existing optimization tools, and PyLO makes these accessible to the broader machine learning community.

Abstract: Learned optimizers have been an active research topic over the past decade,
with increasing progress toward practical, general-purpose optimizers that can
serve as drop-in replacements for widely used methods like Adam. However,
recent advances -- such as VeLO, which was meta-trained for 4000 TPU-months --
remain largely inaccessible to the broader community, in part due to their
reliance on JAX and the absence of user-friendly packages for applying the
optimizers after meta-training. To address this gap, we introduce PyLO, a
PyTorch-based library that brings learned optimizers to the broader machine
learning community through familiar, widely adopted workflows. Unlike prior
work focused on synthetic or convex tasks, our emphasis is on applying learned
optimization to real-world large-scale pre-training tasks. Our release includes
a CUDA-accelerated version of the small_fc_lopt learned optimizer architecture
from (Metz et al., 2022a), delivering substantial speedups -- from 39.36 to
205.59 samples/sec throughput for training ViT B/16 with batch size 32. PyLO
also allows us to easily combine learned optimizers with existing optimization
tools such as learning rate schedules and weight decay. When doing so, we find
that learned optimizers can substantially benefit. Our code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces PropInfer, a benchmark task for assessing property inference in LLMs, and proposes two attacks that reveal vulnerabilities in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if property inference attacks transfer to LLMs and evaluate the potential vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs in exposing sensitive dataset properties.

Method: Introduced PropInfer benchmark for evaluating property inference in LLMs under question-answering and chat-completion paradigms. Proposed prompt-based generation attack and shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals.

Result: Empirical evaluations across multiple pretrained LLMs demonstrate the success of the proposed attacks, revealing previously unrecognized vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Conclusion: PropInfer successfully evaluates property inference in LLMs, and the proposed attacks highlight significant vulnerabilities that need addressing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

*Aaryam Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the inadequacy of current AQI data in capturing local pollution realities in developing countries by predicting AQI for 1 km^2 areas using the AirDelhi dataset and Spatio-temporal GNNs, achieving a significant reduction in MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution poses a major health risk in developing countries, yet official AQI data does not accurately reflect local conditions due to sparse sensor distribution.

Method: The authors employ Spatio-temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict AQI values for smaller, 1 km^2 neighborhood areas, using the AirDelhi dataset as an example.

Result: This approach results in a 79% reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE), improving to 71.654 MSE, even for locations not covered by existing sensors. The study also uncovers strong repetitive short-term patterns and changing spatial relationships in AQI data.

Conclusion: The application of Spatio-temporal GNNs significantly enhances the accuracy of AQI predictions at localized levels, offering better insights into air quality dynamics.

Abstract: Air pollution has become a significant health risk in developing countries.
While governments routinely publish air-quality index (AQI) data to track
pollution, these values fail to capture the local reality, as sensors are often
very sparse. In this paper, we address this gap by predicting AQI in 1 km^2
neighborhoods, using the example of AirDelhi dataset. Using Spatio-temporal
GNNs we surpass existing works by 71.654 MSE a 79% reduction, even on unseen
coordinates. New insights about AQI such as the existence of strong repetitive
short-term patterns and changing spatial relations are also discovered. The
code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM) agents. However, a principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking.

Method: The authors formalize the LLF problem, assert sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, introduce transfer eluder dimension as a complexity measure, and develop a no-regret algorithm called HELiX.

Result: Demonstrates cases where learning from rich language feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward; shows that HELiX performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs does not work reliably across several empirical domains.

Conclusion: The contributions mark a first step towards designing principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

Motivation: 生理信号常受运动伪影、基线漂移等干扰，且具有强非平稳性，难以用传统时域或滤波方法表示。

Method: 提出了一种基于小波变换的方法，用于捕捉多尺度时频特征，并首次引入针对EMG和ECG的大规模预训练模型，还构建了一个统一的多模态框架，通过可学习的加权融合来整合不同模态的信息。

Conclusion: 该小波架构为各种生理信号的分析奠定了基础，多模态设计对可穿戴健康监测、临床诊断和更广泛的生物医学应用有潜在影响。

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline
drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for
analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with
sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult
to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address
these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis
is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various
physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained
models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving
superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks.
Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating
pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated
branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively
addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject
variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal

analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points
to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on
wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical

*Binyao Guo,Zihan Lin,QiZhi He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经算子的端到端学习框架，用于模拟路径依赖的非弹性材料。该框架通过可观察数据推断隐藏动力学，并开发了具有层次自注意力机制的历史感知神经算子（HANO）。HANO在不同条件下表现出鲁棒性能，优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于RNN的模型在处理路径依赖的材料响应时存在自一致性问题和对初始隐藏状态的敏感性。因此，需要一种新的方法来克服这些问题并提高预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了历史感知神经算子（HANO），这是一种基于Fourier神经算子的自回归模型，能够从应变-应力历史的短片段中预测路径依赖的材料响应。同时嵌入了分层自注意力机制以捕获全局加载模式和关键局部路径依赖。

Result: HANO在两个基准问题上进行了评估：硬化弹塑性和脆性固体中的渐进各向异性损伤。结果显示HANO在预测精度、泛化能力和鲁棒性方面均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: HANO为模拟非弹性材料提供了一个有效的数据驱动代理，并且适合与经典数值求解器集成。

Abstract: This study presents an end-to-end learning framework for data-driven modeling
of path-dependent inelastic materials using neural operators. The framework is
built on the premise that irreversible evolution of material responses,
governed by hidden dynamics, can be inferred from observable data.
  We develop the History-Aware Neural Operator (HANO), an autoregressive model
that predicts path-dependent material responses from short segments of recent
strain-stress history without relying on hidden state variables, thereby
overcoming self-consistency issues commonly encountered in recurrent neural
network (RNN)-based models. Built on a Fourier-based neural operator backbone,
HANO enables discretization-invariant learning. To enhance its ability to
capture both global loading patterns and critical local path dependencies, we
embed a hierarchical self-attention mechanism that facilitates multiscale
feature extraction.
  Beyond ensuring self-consistency, HANO mitigates sensitivity to initial
hidden states, a commonly overlooked issue that can lead to instability in
recurrent models when applied to generalized loading paths. By modeling
stress-strain evolution as a continuous operator rather than relying on fixed
input-output mappings, HANO naturally accommodates varying path discretizations
and exhibits robust performance under complex conditions, including irregular
sampling, multi-cycle loading, noisy data, and pre-stressed states. We evaluate
HANO on two benchmark problems: elastoplasticity with hardening and progressive
anisotropic damage in brittle solids. Results show that HANO consistently
outperforms baseline models in predictive accuracy, generalization, and
robustness. With its demonstrated capabilities, HANO provides an effective
data-driven surrogate for simulating inelastic materials and is well-suited for
integration with classical numerical solvers.

Conclusion: TreeLoRA provides a method for efficient continual learning of large pre-trained models by constructing layer-wise adapters, employing bandit techniques and using sparse gradient updates.

Abstract: Many real-world applications collect data in a streaming environment, where
learning tasks are encountered sequentially. This necessitates continual
learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while
preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with
the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become
increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands
and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of
Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by
leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL,
particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity
estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower
confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we
use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the
approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify
the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers
(ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural
language processing tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving actionable insights that can inform model development, but rigorous causal evaluations face significant methodological challenges.

Method: A causal representation learning framework is proposed wherein observed benchmark performance is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors. These latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after controlling for the base model as a common confounder.

Result: A concise three-node linear causal structure was identified that reliably explains the observed performance variations. The causal direction starts from general problem-solving capabilities, advances through instruction-following proficiency, and culminates in mathematical reasoning ability.

Conclusion: The results underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations during evaluation to accurately uncover the underlying causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Result: PAJAMA improves judgment consistency by 15.83% and reduces biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to LLM-as-a-judge. It outperforms metrics on Prometheus and JudgeLM datasets at significantly lower cost.

Conclusion: PAJAMA provides a cost-effective, interpretable, and less biased alternative for evaluating LLM generations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM

*Bryan Shaddy,Brianna Binder,Agnimitra Dasgupta,Haitong Qin,James Haley,Angel Farguell,Kyle Hilburn,Derek V. Mallia,Adam Kochanski,Jan Mandel,Assad Oberai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) trained on historic wildfire data to estimate fire progression from active fire measurements, ignition times, and terrain height data. It is validated on five Pacific US wildfires with good accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an increasing need for accurate wildfire spread prediction due to rising wildfire occurrences. Current complex models diverge from observed data during multi-day simulations, necessitating the incorporation of data assimilation techniques.

Method: A cGAN is developed and trained using historic wildfire data from WRF-SFIRE model, VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height data. The model estimates fire progression represented by fire arrival time and uses approximate observation operators for training without needing satellite data. Once trained, it leverages real fire measurements and terrain data to generate samples of fire arrival times.

Result: The approach was validated on five Pacific US wildfires, showing an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81 when compared against high-resolution perimeters measured via aircraft. Terrain height had minimal influence on the arrival time inference when conditioned on satellite measurements.

Conclusion: The developed cGAN model successfully estimates wildfire progression with high accuracy, demonstrating potential for improving wildfire prediction through data assimilation.

Abstract: Increasing wildfire occurrence has spurred growing interest in wildfire
spread prediction. However, even the most complex wildfire models diverge from
observed progression during multi-day simulations, motivating need for data
assimilation. A useful approach to assimilating measurement data into complex
coupled atmosphere-wildfire models is to estimate wildfire progression from
measurements and use this progression to develop a matching atmospheric state.
In this study, an approach is developed for estimating fire progression from
VIIRS active fire measurements, GOES-derived ignition times, and terrain height
data. A conditional Generative Adversarial Network is trained with simulations
of historic wildfires from the atmosphere-wildfire model WRF-SFIRE, thus
allowing incorporation of WRF-SFIRE physics into estimates. Fire progression is
succinctly represented by fire arrival time, and measurements for training are
obtained by applying an approximate observation operator to WRF-SFIRE
solutions, eliminating need for satellite data during training. The model is
trained on tuples of fire arrival times, measurements, and terrain, and once
trained leverages measurements of real fires and corresponding terrain data to
generate samples of fire arrival times. The approach is validated on five
Pacific US wildfires, with results compared against high-resolution perimeters
measured via aircraft, finding an average Sorensen-Dice coefficient of 0.81.
The influence of terrain height on the arrival time inference is also evaluated
and it is observed that terrain has minimal influence when the inference is
conditioned on satellite measurements.

Motivation: Real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and missing data, which are not adequately addressed by existing benchmarks that assume clean and regular data.

Method: Introduced Time-IMM dataset capturing nine types of irregularities in time series data categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Also introduced IMM-TSF, a benchmark library with specialized fusion modules for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series.

Result: Explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance.

Conclusion: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at

*Weiying Zhao,Aleksei Unagaev,Natalia Efremova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hybrid spectral-cLHS method that combines spectral clustering with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to improve the representativeness of soil organic carbon (SOC) sampling locations. This method ensures more uniform coverage of environmental conditions, potentially leading to more accurate SOC predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOC monitoring methods rely on selecting representative field sampling locations using environmental covariates. However, traditional techniques like cLHS may overlook minor but important environmental clusters. Thus, there is a need for an enhanced sampling strategy that captures the full diversity of environmental conditions.

Method: The proposed hybrid methodology integrates spectral clustering and cLHS. Spectral clustering partitions the study area into homogeneous zones based on multivariate covariate data, and cLHS selects sampling locations within each zone to ensure comprehensive coverage of environmental conditions.

Result: The spectral-cLHS method provides more uniform coverage of covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity compared to standard cLHS when demonstrated on a real SOC mapping dataset.

Conclusion: The improved sampling design using spectral-cLHS has the potential to yield more accurate SOC predictions by offering better-balanced training data for machine learning models.

Abstract: Soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring often relies on selecting representative
field sampling locations based on environmental covariates. We propose a novel
hybrid methodology that integrates spectral clustering - an unsupervised
machine learning technique with conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) to
enhance the representativeness of SOC sampling. In our approach, spectral
clustering partitions the study area into $K$ homogeneous zones using
multivariate covariate data, and cLHS is then applied within each zone to
select sampling locations that collectively capture the full diversity of
environmental conditions. This hybrid spectral-cLHS method ensures that even
minor but important environmental clusters are sampled, addressing a key
limitation of vanilla cLHS which can overlook such areas. We demonstrate on a
real SOC mapping dataset that spectral-cLHS provides more uniform coverage of
covariate feature space and spatial heterogeneity than standard cLHS. This
improved sampling design has the potential to yield more accurate SOC
predictions by providing better-balanced training data for machine learning
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of skilled engineers and manual optimizations of PCB schematics are very time-consuming, often neglected, leading to higher costs for troubleshooting and shortened product life cycles.

Method: Representing PCB schematics as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

Result: GNNs can solve PCB design optimization problems with high accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach offers the potential to automate PCB design optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

Abstract: The design and optimization of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) schematics is
crucial for the development of high-quality electronic devices. Thereby, an
important task is to optimize drafts by adding components that improve the
robustness and reliability of the circuit, e.g., pull-up resistors or
decoupling capacitors. Since there is a shortage of skilled engineers and
manual optimizations are very time-consuming, these best practices are often
neglected. However, this typically leads to higher costs for troubleshooting in
later development stages as well as shortened product life cycles, resulting in
an increased amount of electronic waste that is difficult to recycle. Here, we
present an approach for automating the addition of new components into PCB
schematics by representing them as bipartite graphs and utilizing a node pair
prediction model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We apply our approach
to three highly relevant PCB design optimization tasks and compare the
performance of several popular GNN architectures on real-world datasets labeled
by human experts. We show that GNNs can solve these problems with high accuracy
and demonstrate that our approach offers the potential to automate PCB design
optimizations in a time- and cost-efficient manner.

*Antonio Ferrara,Francesco Cozzi,Alan Perotti,André Panisson,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates
against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point
estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is
statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic
subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional
analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving
rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more
granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable
estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,
precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing
framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical
decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we
prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to
analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive)
error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small
intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial
estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size
and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We
validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our
tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying
degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years.
Despite considerable progress, dynamic regret minimization has primarily
focused on convex functions, leaving the functions with stronger curvature
(e.g., squared or logistic loss) underexplored. In this work, we address this
gap by showing that the regret can be substantially improved by leveraging the
concept of mixability, a property that generalizes exp-concavity to effectively
capture loss curvature. Let $d$ denote the dimensionality and $P_T$ the path
length of comparators that reflects the environmental non-stationarity. We
demonstrate that an exponential-weight method with fixed-share updates achieves
an $\mathcal{O}(d T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$ dynamic regret for mixable losses,
improving upon the best-known $\mathcal{O}(d^{10/3} T^{1/3} P_T^{2/3} \log T)$
result (Baby and Wang, 2021) in $d$. More importantly, this improvement arises
from a simple yet powerful analytical framework that exploits the mixability,
which avoids the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based analysis required by existing work.

### [84] [Deep Learning-Based Digitization of Overlapping ECG Images with Open-Source Python Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10617)
*Reza Karbasi,Masoud Rahimi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie,Hadi Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a two-stage pipeline for digitizing paper-based ECG recordings, especially focusing on handling signal overlaps. The method uses a U-Net based segmentation network followed by an adaptive grid detection module for digitization. It shows superior performance compared to baseline techniques in both non-overlapping and overlapping ECG samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately digitize paper-based ECG recordings, particularly addressing the challenge of signal overlaps which is under-addressed in current methodologies.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: 1) U-Net based segmentation network trained on a dataset with overlapping signals and custom augmentations to isolate the primary ECG trace; 2) Conversion of the binary mask into a time-series signal using enhanced digitization techniques with an adaptive grid detection module.

Result: The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87. For non-overlapping signals, the proposed method has a MSE of 0.0010 and rho of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366 for the baseline. For overlapping signals, it has a MSE of 0.0029 and rho of 0.9641, significantly better than the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances digitization accuracy, particularly in the presence of signal overlaps, providing a reliable way to convert analog ECG records into digital data for research and clinical use.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

### [85] [Leveraging Low-rank Factorizations of Conditional Correlation Matrices in Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10628)
*Thu Ha Phi,Alexandre Hippert-Ferrer,Florent Bouchard,Arnaud Breloy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a graph learning framework using low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix and Riemannian optimization techniques, demonstrating an efficient dimension-performance trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of learning an undirected graph from data gathered at each node is computationally challenging due to scaling with the square of the number of variables (nodes), especially in high dimensions.

Method: The authors propose leveraging a low-rank factorization of the conditional correlation matrix and develop tools for applying Riemannian optimization techniques. They also adapt the GLasso algorithm with low-rank constraints.

Result: Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that this approach achieves a very efficient trade-off between dimension and performance.

Conclusion: This method offers a promising solution to the graph learning problem by reducing computational complexity while maintaining good performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning an undirected graph from data
gathered at each nodes. Within the graph signal processing framework, the
topology of such graph can be linked to the support of the conditional
correlation matrix of the data. The corresponding graph learning problem then
scales to the squares of the number of variables (nodes), which is usually
problematic at large dimension. To tackle this issue, we propose a graph
learning framework that leverages a low-rank factorization of the conditional
correlation matrix. In order to solve for the resulting optimization problems,
we derive tools required to apply Riemannian optimization techniques for this
particular structure. The proposal is then particularized to a low-rank
constrained counterpart of the GLasso algorithm, i.e., the penalized maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian graphical model. Experiments on synthetic
and real data evidence that a very efficient dimension-versus-performance
trade-off can be achieved with this approach.

### [86] [Task Adaptation from Skills: Information Geometry, Disentanglement, and New Objectives for Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10629)
*Yucheng Yang,Tianyi Zhou,Qiang He,Lei Han,Mykola Pechenizkiy,Meng Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new theoretical analysis for Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) in unsupervised reinforcement learning, introducing novel metrics and algorithms (LSEPIN, WSEP, PWSEP) that enhance downstream task adaptation by improving skill diversity and separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised reinforcement learning aims to learn general skills for unseen downstream tasks. However, MISL lacks sufficient theoretical analysis regarding how well its learned skills can initialize a downstream task's policy.

Method: The authors introduce a disentanglement metric LSEPIN, establish an information-geometric connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost, replace KL divergence with Wasserstein distance leading to the WSEP objective, and propose the PWSEP algorithm.

Result: The proposed methods are theoretically justified to improve downstream task adaptation by discovering more initial policies than MISL and potentially all optimal initial policies.

Conclusion: Novel metrics and algorithms (LSEPIN, WSEP, PWSEP) provide better geometric properties and enhance the ability to discover optimal initial policies for downstream tasks.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for
unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL
by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks
sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can
initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this
paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are
fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not
necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel
disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric
connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better
geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL
divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the
geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP.
It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and
it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than
MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP
that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

### [87] [Time Series Forecasting as Reasoning: A Slow-Thinking Approach with Reinforced LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10630)
*Yucong Luo,Yitong Zhou,Mingyue Cheng,Jiahao Wang,Daoyu Wang,Tingyue Pan,Jintao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: To advance time series forecasting, the paper proposes Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs that enhances multi-step reasoning ability and significantly improves forecast performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for time series forecasting mainly rely on historical pattern extraction without explicit intermediate reasoning processes. Although slow-thinking LLMs show potential in multi-step reasoning, they face limitations such as high computational cost, privacy risks, and insufficient domain-specific reasoning capacity.

Method: The proposed method is Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework. The first stage involves supervised fine-tuning for adaptation, while the second uses reinforcement learning to improve generalization. Additionally, a fine-grained multi-objective reward and GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization) are introduced to optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments indicate that Time-R1 considerably enhances forecast performance across various datasets.

Conclusion: Time-R1 effectively leverages reinforcement learning to enhance the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs for time series forecasting, leading to significant improvements in prediction accuracy.

Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed
to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to
data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most
existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting
historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling
philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate
time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1)
have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an
alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone
presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy
risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning.
To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to
develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning
skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement
fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs
for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised
fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement
learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design
a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting,
and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy
optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and
optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments
demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across
diverse datasets.

*Alexander Lobashev,Dmitry Guskov,Maria Larchenko,Mikhail Tamm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method for analyzing the latent space geometry of generative models by reconstructing the Fisher information metric, providing theoretical convergence guarantees and demonstrating its effectiveness on various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the complex structure of generative model latent spaces, particularly in terms of their geometry, and to explore connections with phenomena like phase transitions.

Method: The method involves approximating the posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for exponential families. It is applied to both statistical physics models and diffusion models.

Result: The method outperforms existing baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities for the Ising and TASEP models. For diffusion models, it reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the latent space geometry of diffusion models and their connection to phase transitions, suggesting that geodesic interpolations are linear within individual phases but break down at phase boundaries.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

### [89] [Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10647)
*Lang Yin,Debangshu Banerjee,Gagandeep Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chain of Thought (CoT) enhances transformers' ability to solve complex problems like the $k$-parity problem, but its effectiveness is challenged by data shifts and poisoned training data. This study investigates these impacts, revealing that CoT can sometimes lead to worse performance than direct prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how distribution shifts and data poisoning affect the performance of models using CoT, particularly in solving the $k$-parity problem.

Method: Investigate the joint impact of distribution shifts and data poisoning on models trained with a well-established CoT decomposition for the $k$-parity problem.

Result: Found that CoT can lead to worse performance on learning parity compared to directly generating predictions, providing a rigorous explanation for this phenomenon.

Conclusion: CoT's effectiveness is compromised under real-world conditions where data shifts and corruption occur.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models
(LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In
recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms
of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally
difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be
able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity
problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1)
identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training
data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these
assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught
attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by
such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem,
in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the
distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models
obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a
surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity
than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a
rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such
impact.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络系统在面对连续任务时容易出现灾难性遗忘问题，而现有的SOMs也不能幸免。因此，需要一种新的方法来改善SOMs在持续学习中的表现。

Method: SatSOM扩展了SOMs，加入了一种新的饱和机制，该机制随着神经元积累信息逐渐降低学习率和邻居半径，从而冻结训练良好的神经元并将学习重定向到地图中未充分利用的区域。

Result: SatSOM能够更有效地保留已学习的知识，并在持续学习场景下表现出色。

Conclusion: SatSOM为解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题提供了一种有效的方法，其通过饱和机制提升了SOMs的知识保留能力。

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which
often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are
not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation
Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve
knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a
novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and
neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively
freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of
the map.

TL;DR: 现代神经网络常常编码不想要的概念，导致公平性和可解释性问题。现有的事后方法可以去除不需要的概念，但往往会损害有用信号。本文提出了一种新的方法SPLICE，可以在去除敏感概念的同时精确保留目标标签的协方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在执行任务时可能会编码一些不希望出现的概念，这引发了关于公平性和可解释性的担忧。因此，需要一种方法可以在去除这些不需要的概念的同时，尽可能地保护有用的信号。

Method: SPLICE（Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal and Covariance prEservation）通过斜投影来消除不需要的方向，同时保护重要的标签相关性。它能够从表示中删除敏感概念，同时准确地保持它们与目标标签的协方差。

Result: 理论上，SPLICE是唯一能够在去除线性概念预测能力的同时，维持目标协方差并最小化嵌入失真的解决方案。实证上，在诸如Bias in Bios和Winobias等基准测试中，SPLICE的表现优于基线模型，能够去除受保护属性，同时对主任务信息的损害最小。

Conclusion: SPLICE是一种有效的方法，可以在去除不需要的概念的同时，最大限度地保留有用的信息，解决了现有方法可能损害有用信号的问题。

Abstract: Modern neural networks often encode unwanted concepts alongside task-relevant
information, leading to fairness and interpretability concerns. Existing
post-hoc approaches can remove undesired concepts but often degrade useful
signals. We introduce SPLICE-Simultaneous Projection for LInear concept removal
and Covariance prEservation-which eliminates sensitive concepts from
representations while exactly preserving their covariance with a target label.
SPLICE achieves this via an oblique projection that "splices out" the unwanted
direction yet protects important label correlations. Theoretically, it is the
unique solution that removes linear concept predictability and maintains target
covariance with minimal embedding distortion. Empirically, SPLICE outperforms
baselines on benchmarks such as Bias in Bios and Winobias, removing protected
attributes while minimally damaging main-task information.

Motivation: 当前的表格原生ICL架构虽然高效，但仅在合成数据上训练，未能充分利用真实世界表格数据的丰富语义和世界知识；而基于预训练大型语言模型的表格ICL模型虽具备深度语义理解和世界知识，但受架构限制只能利用少量上下文。

Method: 引入ConTextTab模型，该模型通过使用特定于不同数据模态的嵌入，并在大规模真实世界表格数据上进行训练，将语义理解和对齐集成到表格原生ICL框架中。

Result: ConTextTab模型在广泛的基准测试中具有竞争力，并在语义丰富的CARTE基准测试中树立了新标准。

Conclusion: ConTextTab成功地结合了表格原生ICL框架的架构效率和大型语言模型的语义理解能力，为表格预测任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted
to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and
TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally
efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL
architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully
leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular
data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained
large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding
and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context
due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of
both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding
and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized
embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale
real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set
of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In monotone classification, the input is a multi-set $P$ of points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, each associated with a hidden label from $\{-1, 1\}$. The goal
is to identify a monotone function $h$, which acts as a classifier, mapping
from $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\{-1, 1\}$ with a small {\em error}, measured as the
number of points $p \in P$ whose labels differ from the function values $h(p)$.
The cost of an algorithm is defined as the number of points having their labels
revealed. This article presents the first study on the lowest cost required to
find a monotone classifier whose error is at most $(1 + \epsilon) \cdot k^*$
where $\epsilon \ge 0$ and $k^*$ is the minimum error achieved by an optimal
monotone classifier -- in other words, the error is allowed to exceed the
optimal by at most a relative factor. Nearly matching upper and lower bounds
are presented for the full range of $\epsilon$. All previous work on the
problem can only achieve an error higher than the optimal by an absolute
factor.

TL;DR: A new energy function, log-sum-ReLU (LSR), is proposed for DenseAM networks which enables exact memory retrieval with exponential capacity and introduces emergent local minima while preserving perfect pattern recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon the limitations of the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function by proposing a novel energy function based on the Epanechnikov kernel that can enable exact memory retrieval without requiring exponential separation functions.

Method: The method involves using the log-sum-ReLU (LSR) energy function in DenseAM networks, inspired by optimal kernel density estimation, to create a model that has abundant emergent local minima while maintaining perfect pattern recovery.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate that LSR energy has significantly more local minima (memories) with comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models and reveals creativity and novelty when applied to image datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed LSR energy function shows potential for both large-scale memory storage and generative tasks due to its ability to introduce emergent local minima while preserving perfect pattern recovery.

Abstract: We propose a novel energy function for Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM)
networks, the log-sum-ReLU (LSR), inspired by optimal kernel density
estimation. Unlike the common log-sum-exponential (LSE) function, LSR is based
on the Epanechnikov kernel and enables exact memory retrieval with exponential
capacity without requiring exponential separation functions. Moreover, it
introduces abundant additional \emph{emergent} local minima while preserving
perfect pattern recovery -- a characteristic previously unseen in DenseAM
literature. Empirical results show that LSR energy has significantly more local
minima (memories) that have comparable log-likelihood to LSE-based models.
Analysis of LSR's emergent memories on image datasets reveals a degree of
creativity and novelty, hinting at this method's potential for both large-scale
memory storage and generative tasks.

TL;DR: The paper explores activation probes for detecting high-stakes interactions in Large Language Models, finding them to generalize well and be computationally efficient compared to LLM monitors, while suggesting the potential for hierarchical monitoring systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for safe deployment of Large Language Models by focusing on detecting high-stakes interactions which could lead to significant harm.

Method: Evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data for their ability to detect high-stakes interactions, comparing their performance and efficiency against prompted or finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors.

Result: Probes exhibit robust generalization to real-world data, perform comparably to LLM monitors, and offer significant computational savings. They also show potential for use in hierarchical monitoring systems.

Conclusion: Activation probes are effective and efficient for detecting high-stakes interactions in LLMs, with potential applications in resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems.

Abstract: Monitoring is an important aspect of safely deploying Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper examines activation probes for detecting "high-stakes"
interactions -- where the text indicates that the interaction might lead to
significant harm -- as a critical, yet underexplored, target for such
monitoring. We evaluate several probe architectures trained on synthetic data,
and find them to exhibit robust generalization to diverse, out-of-distribution,
real-world data. Probes' performance is comparable to that of prompted or
finetuned medium-sized LLM monitors, while offering computational savings of
six orders-of-magnitude. Our experiments also highlight the potential of
building resource-aware hierarchical monitoring systems, where probes serve as
an efficient initial filter and flag cases for more expensive downstream
analysis. We release our novel synthetic dataset and codebase to encourage
further study.

*Ravishka Rathnasuriya,Tingxi Li,Zexin Xu,Zihe Song,Mirazul Haque,Simin Chen,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the efficiency robustness of Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs), presenting a taxonomy of efficiency adversarial attacks that exploit dynamic behaviors, and identifies challenges and limitations in current defense mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand and address the vulnerabilities of DDLSs against efficiency adversarial attacks which exploit dynamic behaviors to degrade system performance.

Method: Categorizing efficiency adversarial attacks based on three dynamic behaviors of DDLSs: dynamic computations per inference, dynamic inference iterations, and dynamic output production for downstream tasks. Evaluating adversarial strategies targeting DDLSs' efficiency and investigating existing defense mechanisms.

Result: Identified key challenges in securing DDLSs from efficiency adversarial attacks and demonstrated the limitations of current defense mechanisms.

Conclusion: There is a necessity for novel mitigation strategies to secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as
mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning
Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing
overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior
introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks
exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper
systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first
comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based
on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference,
(ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic
output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we
analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key
challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing
defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly
popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to
secure future adaptive DDLSs.

TL;DR: This paper develops a machine learning framework for detecting credit card fraud using real-world data, including feature engineering and unsupervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the increasing need for intelligent systems to detect fraud in digital payments.

Method: The method involves merging datasets, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and training unsupervised models like Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and deep autoencoder.

Result: Unsupervised models flag top 1% of reconstruction errors as outliers, PCA visualizations show model's ability to separate anomalies, and clustering techniques identify normal and suspicious regions.

Conclusion: An end-to-end, feature-rich machine learning framework was successfully developed for detecting credit card transaction anomalies and fraud.

Abstract: The rise of digital payments has accelerated the need for intelligent and
scalable systems to detect fraud. This research presents an end-to-end,
feature-rich machine learning framework for detecting credit card transaction
anomalies and fraud using real-world data. The study begins by merging
transactional, cardholder, merchant, and merchant category datasets from a
relational database to create a unified analytical view. Through the feature
engineering process, we extract behavioural signals such as average spending,
deviation from historical patterns, transaction timing irregularities, and
category frequency metrics. These features are enriched with temporal markers
such as hour, day of week, and weekend indicators to expose all latent patterns
that indicate fraudulent behaviours. Exploratory data analysis reveals
contextual transaction trends across all the dataset features. Using the
transactional data, we train and evaluate a range of unsupervised models:
Isolation Forest, One Class SVM, and a deep autoencoder trained to reconstruct
normal behavior. These models flag the top 1% of reconstruction errors as
outliers. PCA visualizations illustrate each models ability to separate
anomalies into a two-dimensional latent space. We further segment the
transaction landscape using K-Means clustering and DBSCAN to identify dense
clusters of normal activity and isolate sparse, suspicious regions.

*Pierre-François Massiani,Alexander von Rohr,Lukas Haverbeck,Sebastian Trimpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Despite recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), robustly satisfying state constraints under unknown disturbances remains a challenge. This paper explores the interplay between entropy regularization and constraints penalization, revealing that entropy regularization inherently promotes constraints satisfaction robust to action noise. By relaxing strict safety constraints through penalties, the constrained RL problem can be closely approximated by an unconstrained one, preserving both safety and optimality while improving resilience to disturbances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of learning policies in reinforcement learning that can robustly satisfy state constraints even under unknown disturbances, leveraging the techniques of entropy regularization and constraints penalization.

Method: This paper employs entropy regularization and constraints penalization in model-free RL. It empirically demonstrates that entropy regularization biases learning towards maximizing future viable actions, promoting robust constraint satisfaction. Constraints are relaxed through penalties, allowing the constrained RL problem to be approximated by an unconstrained one using standard model-free RL methods.

Result: The results indicate that the connection between entropy regularization and robustness is promising for further investigation. Robust safety in RL can be achieved through simple reward shaping, preserving safety and optimality while improving resilience to disturbances.

Conclusion: Entropy regularization inherently promotes robust constraint satisfaction in reinforcement learning, and the constrained RL problem can be effectively approximated by an unconstrained one through constraints penalization, leading to improved resilience to disturbances.

Abstract: Despite the many recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), the question
of learning policies that robustly satisfy state constraints under unknown
disturbances remains open. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on
achieving robust safety by analyzing the interplay between two well-established
techniques in model-free RL: entropy regularization, and constraints
penalization. We reveal empirically that entropy regularization in constrained
RL inherently biases learning toward maximizing the number of future viable
actions, thereby promoting constraints satisfaction robust to action noise.
Furthermore, we show that by relaxing strict safety constraints through
penalties, the constrained RL problem can be approximated arbitrarily closely
by an unconstrained one and thus solved using standard model-free RL. This
reformulation preserves both safety and optimality while empirically improving
resilience to disturbances. Our results indicate that the connection between
entropy regularization and robustness is a promising avenue for further
empirical and theoretical investigation, as it enables robust safety in RL
through simple reward shaping.

*Lucas Gnecco-Heredia,Benjamin Negrevergne,Yann Chevaleyre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Finite mixtures of classifiers (randomized ensembles) are proposed to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. The paper addresses the problem of attacking such mixtures and introduces two properties of attacks - effectiveness and maximality, showing that existing attacks don't meet both. It also presents a new attack called lattice climber attack with theoretical guarantees in binary linear setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a principled way to attack finite mixtures of classifiers (randomized ensembles), as current attacks are not suitable for this type of classifier. This involves introducing desirable properties of attacks based on geometrical analysis.

Method: The method involves discussing the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way, introducing two desirable properties of attacks - effectiveness and maximality, demonstrating that existing attacks do not meet these properties, and presenting a new attack called lattice climber attack with theoretical guarantees in the binary linear setting.

Result: The result is the introduction of a new attack, the lattice climber attack, which has theoretical guarantees in the binary linear setting and demonstrates performance through experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that current attacks are not effective against randomized ensembles and a new attack, the lattice climber attack, is introduced with theoretical guarantees and demonstrated performance.

Abstract: Finite mixtures of classifiers (a.k.a. randomized ensembles) have been
proposed as a way to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However,
existing attacks have been shown to not suit this kind of classifier. In this
paper, we discuss the problem of attacking a mixture in a principled way and
introduce two desirable properties of attacks based on a geometrical analysis
of the problem (effectiveness and maximality). We then show that existing
attacks do not meet both of these properties. Finally, we introduce a new
attack called {\em lattice climber attack} with theoretical guarantees in the
binary linear setting, and demonstrate its performance by conducting
experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

*Jari Kolehmainen,Nikolay Blagoev,John Donaghy,Oğuzhan Ersoy,Christopher Nies*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的优化方法NoLoCo，该方法在训练期间不需要显式同步所有模型参数，也不需要任何集体通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型通常需要使用包含数万个加速器的集群，并通过高带宽互连进行通信，但扩展这些集群成本高昂且可能不切实际。现有的低通信训练方法尽管减少了通信需求，但仍需对模型参数进行同步步骤，这在网络带宽较低时会变得昂贵。

Method: NoLoCo通过部分平均模型权重与随机选择的其他权重来隐式同步模型权重，使用Nesterov动量优化器的一种新变体实现。提供了理论收敛性分析和语言模型训练的实证结果。

Result: NoLoCo在不同加速器数量和模型大小（从125M到6.8B参数）上进行了基准测试，通信开销显著低于完全分片数据并行训练或低通信训练方法DiLoCo。同步步骤比DiLoCo使用的all-reduce快一个数量级，并且没有全局阻塞通信，减少了加速器空闲时间。相比DiLoCo，观察到多达4%的更快收敛率。

Conclusion: NoLoCo是一种有效的优化方法，能够在减少通信开销的同时保持或提高收敛速度，适用于大规模分布式训练场景。

Abstract: Training large language models is generally done via optimization methods on
clusters containing tens of thousands of accelerators, communicating over a
high-bandwidth interconnect. Scaling up these clusters is expensive and can
become impractical, imposing limits on the size of models that can be trained.
Several recent studies have proposed training methods that are less
communication intensive, avoiding the need for a highly connected compute
cluster. These state-of-the-art low communication training methods still employ
a synchronization step for model parameters, which, when performed over all
model replicas, can become costly on a low-bandwidth network.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization method, NoLoCo, that does not
explicitly synchronize all model parameters during training and, as a result,
does not require any collective communication. NoLoCo implicitly synchronizes
model weights via a novel variant of the Nesterov momentum optimizer by
partially averaging model weights with a randomly selected other one. We
provide both a theoretical convergence analysis for our proposed optimizer as
well as empirical results from language model training.
  We benchmark NoLoCo on a wide range of accelerator counts and model sizes,
between 125M to 6.8B parameters. Our method requires significantly less
communication overhead than fully sharded data parallel training or even widely
used low communication training method, DiLoCo. The synchronization step itself
is estimated to be one magnitude faster than the all-reduce used in DiLoCo for
few hundred accelerators training over the internet. We also do not have any
global blocking communication that reduces accelerator idling time. Compared to
DiLoCo, we also observe up to $4\%$ faster convergence rate with wide range of
model sizes and accelerator counts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CausalFM is a new framework that uses Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for causal inference, offering competitive performance in estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs). It introduces causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks and can be applied to various settings like back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based foundation models in various causal inference settings, addressing the need for principled Bayesian priors in causal inference.

Method: Formalize Bayesian priors construction based on SCMs, propose a family of prior distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks, instantiate CausalFM for CATE estimation with back-door adjustment.

Result: CausalFM performs competitively in CATE estimation across synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks.

Conclusion: CausalFM provides a general method to train foundation models for various causal inference tasks and represents a novel paradigm that could change how causal inference is performed in multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have recently been proposed as a promising
way to train tabular foundation models. PFNs are transformers that are
pre-trained on synthetic data generated from a prespecified prior distribution
and that enable Bayesian inference through in-context learning. In this paper,
we introduce CausalFM, a comprehensive framework for training PFN-based
foundation models in various causal inference settings. First, we formalize the
construction of Bayesian priors for causal inference based on structural causal
models (SCMs) in a principled way and derive necessary criteria for the
validity of such priors. Building on this, we propose a novel family of prior
distributions using causality-inspired Bayesian neural networks that enable
CausalFM to perform Bayesian causal inference in various settings, including
back-door, front-door, and instrumental variable adjustment. Finally, we
instantiate CausalFM and explicitly train a foundation model for estimating
conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using back-door adjustment. We
show that CausalFM performs competitively for CATE estimation using various
synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. In sum, our framework can be used as a
general recipe to train foundation models for various causal inference
settings. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art in causal inference,
CausalFM offers a novel paradigm with the potential to fundamentally change how
practitioners perform causal inference in medicine, economics, and other
disciplines.

TL;DR: 现代神经序列模型实现了并行训练和快速顺序推理的双重目标。本文探讨了支持近常数时间并行评估和线性时间、常数空间顺序推理的神经序列模型的完整类别，提出了状态空间模型和更通用的可前缀扫描模型（PSMs），统一了许多现有架构，并引入了新的模型。实验表明，PSMs保留了基于Transformer架构的表达能力，同时匹配了状态空间模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经序列模型需要满足并行训练和快速顺序推理的需求。已有的模型如门控线性注意力（GLA）和Mamba等实现了这种“顺序-并行二元性”。因此，有必要对支持近常数时间并行评估和线性时间、常数空间顺序推理的神经序列模型进行全面描述。

Method: 首先描述了一类广泛的状态空间模型，其状态更新可以通过经典的并行前缀扫描算法计算，使用自定义的结合聚合运算符。接着定义了一个更通用的类别——可前缀扫描模型（PSMs），通过放宽状态聚合运算符，允许任意（可能非结合的）函数，例如softmax注意力。这一概括统一了许多现有的架构，并引入了新的模型。

Result: 在小规模语言建模和经典合成任务上的实证评估表明，PSMs保留了基于Transformer架构的表达能力，同时匹配了状态空间模型的推理效率。在某些情况下，展示出比任一模型更好的长度泛化性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的状态空间模型和可前缀扫描模型（PSMs）为神经序列模型的研究提供了一个新的视角，既保留了Transformer架构的表达能力，又具备高效推理的特点。

Abstract: Modern neural sequence models are designed to meet the dual mandate of
parallelizable training and fast sequential inference. Recent developments have
given rise to various models, such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Mamba,
that achieve such ``sequential-parallel duality.'' This raises a natural
question: can we characterize the full class of neural sequence models that
support near-constant-time parallel evaluation and linear-time, constant-space
sequential inference? We begin by describing a broad class of such models --
state space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the
classic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation
operator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),
by relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially
non-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization
unifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)
and linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new
models with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per
token and log(N) memory for sequence length N. We empirically evaluate such
models on illustrative small-scale language modeling and canonical synthetic
tasks, including state tracking and associative recall. Empirically, we find
that PSMs retain the expressivity of transformer-based architectures while
matching the inference efficiency of state space models -- in some cases
exhibiting better length generalization than either.

*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) used in hiring can develop significant racial and gender biases when realistic context is introduced, despite anti-bias prompts. The study proposes an internal bias mitigation method that identifies and neutralizes sensitive attribute directions within model activations, effectively reducing bias to very low levels while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of simple anti-bias prompts in eliminating demographic biases in LLMs when realistic contextual details are introduced during hiring applications.

Method: The method involves identifying race and gender-correlated directions within model activations and applying affine concept editing at inference time to neutralize these sensitive attribute directions.

Result: This approach robustly reduces bias across all tested scenarios to very low levels (typically under 1%, always below 2.5%) while largely preserving model performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies to ensure equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）虽强大但静态，缺乏适应新任务、知识或示例的机制。本文介绍了一种名为SEAL的框架，使LLMs能够通过生成自己的微调数据和更新指令进行自我适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs功能强大，但它们是静态的，无法根据新任务、知识或示例调整其权重。因此，需要一种方法使LLMs能够自我适应。

Method: SEAL框架使LLMs能够通过生成自己的微调数据和更新指令进行自我适应。给定一个新输入，模型会产生一个自我编辑，这可能以不同方式重构信息、指定优化超参数或调用用于数据增强和基于梯度的更新的工具。通过监督微调（SFT），这些自我编辑导致持久的权重更新，实现持续适应。为了训练模型生成有效的自我编辑，我们使用强化学习循环，将更新模型的下游性能作为奖励信号。与依赖单独适应模块或辅助网络的先前方法不同，SEAL直接使用模型自身的生成来控制其适应过程。

Result: 实验表明，SEAL在知识融合和少量样本泛化方面表现出色，是朝着具备自我指导适应能力的语言模型迈出的有希望的一步。

Conclusion: SEAL是一种有前途的方法，可以使LLMs具备自我指导适应能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to
adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We
introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to
self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given
a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure
the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or
invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through
supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight
updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective
self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream
performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly
uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments
on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a
promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation. Our
website and code is available at https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal.

TL;DR: 提出GUARD框架，通过数据归因指导大型语言模型的遗忘与保留，显著提升保留效用同时有效遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）中的遗忘技术由于法规遵从性、版权保护和隐私问题变得日益重要，但现有方法在遗忘高影响力数据时往往导致效用下降和无意遗忘。

Method: 设计了GUARD框架，引入轻量级代理数据归因度量标准，量化遗忘集和保留集之间的'对齐'程度，并设计新的遗忘目标，为样本分配自适应非均匀遗忘权重，减少无意的保留损失。

Result: 理论证明GUARD显著增强保留能力，实验表明在多个LLM架构上，GUARD大幅改善效用保存，例如在遗忘10%训练数据时，保留集上的效用牺牲减少高达194.92%。

Conclusion: GUARD通过有效的数据归因和新颖的遗忘目标，成功缓解了无意遗忘问题，同时保持了高效的遗忘效果。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

*Boaz Lavon,Shahar Katz,Lior Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), a novel approach to neural code generation that integrates real-time execution signals into the language model generation process, significantly improving code generation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have shown impressive code generation capabilities but typically do not utilize execution feedback during inference, which is a critical signal for human programmers.

Method: EG-CFG dynamically incorporates execution signals as the model generates code. It conducts beam search to sample candidate program completions, extracts execution signals by executing candidates against test cases, and incorporates these signals into the prompt during generation. The method supports native parallelism and provides coherent guidance while preserving syntactic structure.

Result: Experiments across diverse coding tasks demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results from foundational problems to challenging competitive programming tasks.

Conclusion: EG-CFG is an effective method for enhancing neural code generation through the integration of real-time execution signals, with the code available at https://github.com/boazlavon/eg_cfg.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates
real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation

incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing
line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable
solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search
to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract
execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and
finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By
maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and
refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance
while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports
native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in
parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad
set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks
demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance
compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across
various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging
competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance is a simple wrapper that enhances both sample realism and reward in pretrained diffusion models for solving inverse problems. It inverts candidate solutions via unconditional probability flow ODE and uses the resulting latent as initialization for DPS, significantly boosting quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of training-free methods like DPS when dealing with hard inverse problems where the reward is not informative enough, leading to unrealistic outputs.

Method: Propose ReGuidance, a method that takes a candidate solution produced by an algorithm, inverts it by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse, then uses the resulting latent as an initialization for DPS.

Result: ReGuidance significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency on hard inverse problems such as large box in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ReGuidance provides a simple yet effective way to enhance sample realism and reward in pretrained diffusion models for solving inverse problems, offering the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores in-context learning (ICL) for regression of Hölder functions on manifolds, connecting attention mechanisms with kernel methods to derive generalization error bounds and revealing the role of geometry in ICL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand in-context learning (ICL) within the context of structured geometric data, specifically focusing on regression of Hölder functions on manifolds.

Method: Establishing a connection between the attention mechanism and classical kernel methods to derive generalization error bounds for transformers performing regression tasks. This involves analyzing how the intrinsic dimension of the manifold affects these bounds.

Result: Transformers achieve minimax regression rates for Hölder functions on manifolds when enough training tasks are observed. The generalization error depends on the number of training tasks and scales exponentially with the manifold's intrinsic dimension rather than the ambient space dimension.

Conclusion: This work provides foundational insights into the role of geometry in ICL and offers novel tools for studying nonlinear models' ICL.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural
language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the
context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we
initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on
manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism
and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of
the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of
training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression
rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the
intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension.
Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the
number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as
in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into
the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

TL;DR: Farseer是一种新的缩放定律，可以更准确地预测大规模语言模型的训练效果，减少433%的外推误差，并提供了关于最佳计算分配的新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型（LLMs）成本过高，导致小规模实验的结果难以转移到资源密集型的生产系统中，阻碍了创新效率。为了解决这个问题，需要一种新的缩放定律来提高预测准确性。

Method: 通过系统地构建模型损失表面$L(N,D)$，Farseer实现了比以前的定律（如Chinchilla定律）更好的数据拟合。该方法产生了精确、稳健且高度通用的预测，具有出色的外推能力。

Result: 与Chinchilla定律相比，Farseer减少了433%的外推误差，能够可靠地评估各种$(N,D)$设置下的竞争性训练策略，并从小规模研究中得出的结论可以自信地外推以预测大规模性能。此外，Farseer还提供了关于最佳计算分配的新见解。

Conclusion: Farseer验证了其方法的有效性，并全面开源所有模型、数据、结果和日志，以促进进一步的研究。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a
critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to
transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient
innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling
law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically
constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly
better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our
methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,
demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's
law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable
evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,
enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently
extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides
new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced
demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an
extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and
configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are
comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at
https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a method to convert popular neural architectures into neural operators for function space mappings, aiming to enhance deep learning applications in scientific problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to adapt neural networks for scientific applications involving function spaces, as current successes in deep learning have been mainly in finite-dimensional space problems like computer vision and NLP.

Method: Identify key principles for constructing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces and propose a recipe to convert existing neural architectures into neural operators with minimal changes.

Result: A systematic approach for converting neural networks to neural operators is proposed, enabling them to work effectively in practical scientific applications.

Conclusion: This work guides practitioners in adapting neural networks for operator learning, potentially advancing deep learning's impact on solving scientific problems.

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by
continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs),
are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are
typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced
through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that
focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental
disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from
achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in
other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural
networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate
deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,
neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,
physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and
geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful
engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.
Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator
learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural
operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not
directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In
this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing
practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function
spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several
popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.
This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the
steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at

*Sebastian Sanokowski,Lukas Gruber,Christoph Bartmann,Sepp Hochreiter,Sebastian Lehner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 尽管Log Variance (LV)损失通常优于reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL)损失，但在diffusion bridges中，LV损失缺乏像rKL损失那样的优化目标合理性。实验表明，使用log-derivative技巧的rKL损失（rKL-LD）不仅避免了概念问题，还提升了性能，同时减少了超参数调整的需求并提高了训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者发现，在扩散模型中，Log Variance (LV) 损失在某些情况下比 reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) 损失表现更好，但这种优势不适用于 diffusion bridges 或学习扩散系数的情况。因此，需要重新评估和改进这些模型的优化目标。

Method: 通过分析LV损失与rKL损失在不同条件下的梯度一致性，作者指出LV损失在diffusion bridges中无法提供合理的优化目标。相比之下，结合log-derivative技巧的rKL损失能够解决这些问题，并且在实践中表现出更好的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用rKL-LD损失训练的采样器在多个具有挑战性的基准测试中表现更优，同时训练过程更加稳定，对超参数的依赖也较少。

Conclusion: 对于diffusion bridges，使用rKL-LD损失比LV损失更具优势，因为它不仅解决了理论上的问题，还提升了实际性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling
from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)
loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when
using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy
LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the
log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward
processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when
diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for
diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that
can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our
analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick
(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently
outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion
bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD
loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that
rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more
stable training behavior.

*Kyubyung Chae,Hyunbin Jin,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper presents RAAI, a framework that uses LLM attack techniques to generate synthetic data for improving model safety alignment without extensive human-labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and time associated with using human-labeled preference data for aligning large language models (LLMs), and to explore the potential of synthetic data as an alternative.

Method: RAAI detects internal refusal signals in LLMs and adaptively injects predefined phrases to elicit harmful yet fluent completions, effectively 'jailbreaking' the models.

Result: RAAI increased the harmful response rate from 2.15% to up to 61.04% across four benchmarks. Fine-tuning LLMs with RAAI-generated synthetic data improved robustness against harmful prompts while maintaining general capabilities on standard tasks.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that LLM attack methodologies can be transformed into practical tools for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MalwareBench, a dataset with 3,520 jailbreaking prompts to assess LLMs' robustness in resisting malicious code-generation. Experiments reveal mainstream LLMs have limited ability to reject malicious requirements and their security capabilities are further weakened by combined jailbreak methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on LLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks in code generation and provide a tool for evaluating their robustness against such threats.

Method: Proposed MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset including 3,520 jailbreaking prompts based on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories.

Result: Mainstream LLMs show limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, with an average rejection rate of 60.93%, which drops to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak attack algorithms.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant challenges in code security capabilities, as indicated by their susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in generating malicious codes.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened
concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak
attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While
prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs,
their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains
largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark
dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation,
designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based
on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11
jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that
mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation
requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces
the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for
malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak
attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of
LLMs still pose significant challenges.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Private Memorization Editing (PME), a method to prevent private data leakage by editing the model's knowledge of its training data, turning LLMs' memorization ability into a privacy defense strategy. PME reduces leaked PII and improves robustness against privacy attacks without affecting the language model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models may unintentionally memorize Personally Identifiable Information from their training data, posing privacy risks.

Method: Private Memorization Editing detects memorized PII and mitigates it by editing the model's knowledge of its training data.

Result: PME effectively reduces the number of leaked PII in various configurations, sometimes reducing privacy attack accuracy to zero.

Conclusion: PME is a viable approach for enhancing privacy in LLMs without compromising the underlying language model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

Abstract: Key decision-makers in small and medium businesses (SMBs) often lack the

gain a deeper understanding of how SMB executives navigate cybersecurity
decision-making, we deployed a mixed-method approach, conducting

perceived risks in terms of the digital assets they valued, and found reasons
for their choice of defense measures and factors impacting security perception.
We employed the situational awareness model to characterize decision-makers
based on cybersecurity awareness, identifying those who have comparatively low

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but ensuring its security is a big challenge, especially with the advent of powerful quantum computers that could break traditional encryption methods.

Method: The study employs Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) based on the BB84 protocol for secure key creation and Quantum One Time Pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption processes to ensure data privacy in cloud environments.

Result: This combination of QKD, BB84, and QOTP provides a strong defense mechanism against potential hackers, even those equipped with quantum computers, thus securing data both now and in the future.

Conclusion: Quantum cryptography offers a viable solution to enhance cloud computing security by protecting data from advanced cyber threats posed by quantum computers.

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

TL;DR: This paper introduces AQUA, the first watermark framework for protecting image knowledge in Multimodal RAG systems, which ensures robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of protection for image knowledge in existing watermarking methods within Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems as they transition into service-oriented platforms with shared knowledge bases.

Method: AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues to ensure watermark signals survive indirect propagation from image retriever to textual generator.

Result: Experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing.

Conclusion: AQUA fills a key gap in multimodal RAG protection by providing a method for image knowledge protection.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented
platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the
copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods
in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected.
In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image
knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals
into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers
and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals
survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual
generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across
diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and
reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a symbolic identity for generating integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy a + b = c, using powers of 2 and 3 with modular inversion in Z/3^pZ. The method creates abc-triples with low radical values through residue constraints and affine transformations, optimized for the ratio log c / log rad(abc). Computational results show structured candidates, including new triples. This provides an algebraic framework for triple generation and has implications for cryptographic pre-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore the structural features of the abc conjecture by developing a symbolic identity to generate abc-triples with low radical values. This could have applications in cryptography through symbolic entropy filtering.

Method: The construction uses powers of 2 and 3 combined with modular inversion in Z/3^pZ to create a parametric identity with residue constraints. Affine transformations are then used to embed these symbolic triples into a broader space of high-quality examples, optimising for the ratio log c / log rad(abc).

Result: The computational results demonstrate the emergence of structured, radical-minimising candidates, which include both known and novel abc-triples.

Conclusion: This method provides a symbolic and algebraic framework for controlled generation of abc-triples, suggesting potential exploratory implications for symbolic entropy filtering in cryptographic pre-processing.

Abstract: We present a symbolic identity for generating integer triples $(a, b, c)$
satisfying $a + b = c$, inspired by structural features of the \emph{abc
conjecture}. The construction uses powers of $2$ and $3$ in combination with
modular inversion in $\mathbb{Z}/3^p\mathbb{Z}$, leading to a parametric
identity with residue constraints that yield abc-triples exhibiting low radical
values. Through affine transformations, these symbolic triples are embedded
into a broader space of high-quality examples, optimised for the ratio $\log c
/ \log \operatorname{rad}(abc)$. Computational results demonstrate the
emergence of structured, radical-minimising candidates, including both known
and novel triples. These methods provide a symbolic and algebraic framework for
controlled triple generation, and suggest exploratory implications for symbolic
entropy filtering in cryptographic pre-processing.

### [126] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究人员提出了一种名为GenBreak的框架，通过微调大型语言模型（LLM）系统地探索文本到图像（T2I）生成器中的潜在漏洞。该方法结合了监督微调和强化学习，指导LLM创建既能规避安全机制又具有高度毒性的图像提示。这些提示在对商业T2I生成器的黑盒攻击中表现出强大的效果，揭示了实际且令人担忧的安全弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前针对T2I模型的对抗研究存在局限性：一些研究生成的高度毒性图像容易被安全过滤器检测和阻止；另一些则专注于绕过安全机制却未能产生真正有害的输出，缺乏发现高风险提示的能力。因此，亟需可靠的工具来评估防御性T2I模型的安全性。

Method: GenBreak框架通过以下步骤实现：1) 使用策划的数据集进行监督微调；2) 通过与代理T2I模型的交互进行强化学习；3) 整合多种奖励信号，引导LLM生成既具备逃避能力又具有图像毒性的对抗提示，同时保持语义连贯性和多样性。

Result: 生成的对抗提示在对商业T2I生成器的黑盒攻击中表现出了显著的效果，成功揭示了这些模型的实际且令人担忧的安全漏洞。

Conclusion: GenBreak提供了一种有效的方法来评估和揭示T2I模型的安全性问题，强调了进一步改进这些模型安全性的重要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

Abstract: As cyber threats become more sophisticated, rapid and accurate vulnerability
detection is essential for maintaining secure systems. This study explores the
use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software vulnerability assessment by
simulating the identification of Python code with known Common Weakness
Enumerations (CWEs), comparing zero-shot, few-shot cross-domain, and few-shot
in-domain prompting strategies. Our results indicate that while zero-shot
prompting performs poorly, few-shot prompting significantly enhances
classification performance, particularly when integrated with confidence-based
routing strategies that improve efficiency by directing human experts to cases
where model uncertainty is high, optimizing the balance between automation and
expert oversight. We find that LLMs can effectively generalize across
vulnerability categories with minimal examples, suggesting their potential as
scalable, adaptable cybersecurity tools in simulated environments. However,
challenges such as model reliability, interpretability, and adversarial
robustness remain critical areas for future research. By integrating AI-driven
approaches with expert-in-the-loop (EITL) decision-making, this work highlights
a pathway toward more efficient and responsive cybersecurity workflows. Our
findings provide a foundation for deploying AI-assisted vulnerability detection
systems in both real and simulated environments that enhance operational
resilience while reducing the burden on human analysts.

### [128] [D-LiFT: Improving LLM-based Decompiler Backend via Code Quality-driven Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10125)
*Muqi Zou,Hongyu Cai,Hongwei Wu,Zion Leonahenahe Basque,Arslan Khan,Berkay Celik,Dave,Tian,Antonio Bianchi,Ruoyu,Wang,Dongyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper presents D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that uses reinforcement learning to further train large language models (LLMs) for improving the quality of decompiled code while preserving its accuracy. Central to D-LiFT is D-SCORE, a quality assessment system that ensures accurate and readable decompiled code. Experiments show significant improvements in decompiled functions compared to baseline LLMs without D-SCORE fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decompiler outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and are difficult to read. Existing approaches using LLMs to refine decompiler output have limitations, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.

Method: D-LiFT harnesses and further trains LLMs via reinforcement learning to improve decompiled code quality while preserving accuracy. It includes D-SCORE, a quality assessment system that scores decompiled code by verifying syntactic and semantic correctness through a compiler and symbolic execution, and evaluates readability using established metrics.

Result: D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions than baseline LLMs without D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, based on experiments with coreutils and util-linux projects.

Conclusion: D-LiFT significantly enhances the quality of decompiled code while ensuring accuracy, outperforming baseline LLMs.

Abstract: Decompilers, which reconstruct human-readable source code from binary
executables, are vital to many security tasks. Yet, despite recent advances,
their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains
difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs),
researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.
Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations,
such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.
In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that
harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving
accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of
decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}.
Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system
to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle,
D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher
scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically,
D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler
and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then
evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with
the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for
fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs,
demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the
coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without
D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled
functions, as measured by D-SCORE.

*Lucas Truax,Sandip Roy,Laszlo B. Kish*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces KLJN as a new method for securing satellite communications, offering simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness compared to QKD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a more practical and cost-effective approach to secure satellite communications than quantum key distribution (QKD), which is complex, expensive, and environmentally sensitive.

Method: KLJN uses standard electronic components and classical physics principles, providing unconditional security that is resilient to environmental and radiation-induced noise.

Result: KLJN provides a simpler, more cost-effective, and robust alternative to QKD for secure satellite communications, withstanding harsh conditions and integrating with existing infrastructure.

Conclusion: KLJN is a practical choice for many secure communication applications due to its advantages in simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) as an
approach to securing satellite communications. KLJN has the potential to
revolutionize satellite communication security through its combination of
simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and resilience with unconditional security.
Unlike quantum key distribution (QKD), which requires complex, fragile, and
expensive infrastructure like photon detectors and dedicated optical links,
KLJN operates using standard electronic components and wires, significantly
reducing implementation costs and logistical hurdles. KLJN's security, grounded
in the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental
and radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions
of satellite communications. This robustness, coupled with its ability to
integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, positions KLJN as a
revolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient
satellite communications. The authors explore the value of achieving
unconditionally secure communications in strategic ground-to-satellite networks
which address vulnerabilities posed by advanced computational threats,
including quantum computing. Our team has examined two leading approaches to
unconditional security - the KLJN scheme and QKD - and analyzed the potential
use of each for space systems. While QKD leverages quantum mechanics for
security, it faces challenges related to cost, complexity, and environmental
sensitivity. In contrast, the KLJN scheme utilizes classical physics principles
to provide a simpler, more cost-effective, and resilient alternative,
particularly for ground-based systems. The study concludes that KLJN offers
significant advantages in simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making
it a practical choice for many secure communication applications.

*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Large Language Model agents face privacy risks due to continuous access to sensitive data. This study proposes the CMPL framework, which audits conversational privacy by simulating multi-turn interactions to uncover latent vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Large Language Model agents provide operational benefits in various applications, they also pose privacy risks due to their need for continuous access to sensitive data.

Method: The proposed Conversational Manipulation for Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework is an iterative probing strategy designed to stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. It simulates realistic multi-turn interactions rather than focusing solely on single disclosure events.

Result: Evaluation on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks not deterred by existing single-turn defenses.

Conclusion: This paper introduces CMPL as a diagnostic tool, along with an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable risk metrics and an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy across agent implementations.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

TL;DR: AURA is a multi-agent framework for automated and interpretable APT attribution, combining RAG with LLMs to process diverse threat data and provide expert-aligned justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective APT attribution requires correlating behavioral patterns and reasoning over complex threat intelligence artifacts.

Method: AURA ingests diverse threat data including TTPs, IoCs, malware details, adversarial tools, and temporal information, processed through a network of collaborative agents designed for intelligent query rewriting, context-enriched retrieval, and natural language justification.

Result: Experiments on recent APT campaigns demonstrate AURA's high attribution consistency, expert-aligned justifications, and scalability.

Conclusion: This work establishes AURA as a promising direction for advancing transparent, data-driven, and scalable threat attribution using multi-agent intelligence.

Abstract: Effective attribution of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) increasingly
hinges on the ability to correlate behavioral patterns and reason over complex,
varied threat intelligence artifacts. We present AURA (Attribution Using
Retrieval-Augmented Agents), a multi-agent, knowledge-enhanced framework for
automated and interpretable APT attribution. AURA ingests diverse threat data
including Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), Indicators of Compromise
(IoCs), malware details, adversarial tools, and temporal information, which are
processed through a network of collaborative agents. These agents are designed
for intelligent query rewriting, context-enriched retrieval from structured
threat knowledge bases, and natural language justification of attribution
decisions. By combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large
Language Models (LLMs), AURA enables contextual linking of threat behaviors to
known APT groups and supports traceable reasoning across multiple attack
phases. Experiments on recent APT campaigns demonstrate AURA's high attribution
consistency, expert-aligned justifications, and scalability. This work
establishes AURA as a promising direction for advancing transparent,
data-driven, and scalable threat attribution using multi-agent intelligence.

*Marius Mehrl,Mila Pfander,Theresa Winner,Cornelius Fritz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Autocrats use secret police to stay in power, but they are not as common as one might think. This paper explores the conditions under which secret police emerge in dictatorships using statistical variable selection techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand under which conditions secret police emerge in dictatorships.

Method: Apply statistical variable selection techniques to identify which candidate variables hold explanatory power for the emergence of secret police in autocracies.

Result: Secret police are more likely to emerge when rulers face specific, preempt-able threats like protests and anti-system mobilisation, and when they have the material resources to establish these organisations.

Conclusion: This research contributes to our understanding of autocrats' institutional choices and authoritarian politics.

Abstract: Autocrats use secret police to stay in power, as these organizations deter
and suppress opposition to their rule. Existing research shows that secret
police are very good at this but, surprisingly, also that they are not as
ubiquitous in autocracies as one may assume, existing in less than 50% of
autocratic country-years. We thus explore under which conditions secret police
emerge in dictatorships. For this purpose, we apply statistical variable
selection techniques to identify which of several candidate variables extracted
from the literature on state security forces and authoritarian survival hold
explanatory power. Our results highlight that secret police are more likely to
emerge when rulers face specific, preempt-able threats, such as protests and
anti-system mobilisation, but also when they have the material resources to
establish these organisations. This research contributes to our understanding
of autocrats' institutional choices and authoritarian politics.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores the vulnerabilities of machine unlearning methods to prompt attacks, evaluating eight techniques across three model families. Methods like RMU and TAR show robustness, while ELM remains susceptible to certain attacks. Logit analysis indicates that unlearned models do not merely hide knowledge through formatting changes. The results challenge assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and emphasize the need for reliable evaluation frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of various machine unlearning methods when subjected to straightforward prompt attacks and to distinguish between true knowledge removal and superficial output suppression.

Method: Systematically evaluate eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis methods to determine the extent to which supposedly unlearned knowledge can be retrieved.

Result: Methods such as RMU and TAR demonstrate robust unlearning capabilities, whereas ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text recovering 57.3% accuracy). Logit analysis shows a strong correlation between output and logit accuracy, indicating that unlearned models are generally not hiding knowledge by modifying answer formats.

Conclusion: The study challenges prevailing assumptions about the effectiveness of unlearning methods and highlights the necessity for evaluation frameworks that can reliably differentiate between true knowledge removal and superficial output suppression.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

TL;DR: ELFuzz 是一种基于大语言模型驱动的生成式模糊测试方法，能够自动合成高效的模糊测试工具，显著提升代码覆盖率和漏洞检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式模糊测试依赖于输入语法规范和语义约束，但这些规范需要大量人工构建。为了减少手动工作量并提高模糊测试的自动化程度，本文提出了一种新方法 ELFuzz。

Method: ELFuzz 通过大语言模型驱动的进化过程，在模糊测试空间中自动生成适合被测系统的模糊测试工具。从简单的种子模糊测试工具开始，结合覆盖范围指导进行全自动进化。

Result: ELFuzz 达到比现有方法高 434.8% 的代码覆盖率，并触发多达 174.0% 的人工注入漏洞。在实际应用中，它发现了五个 0-day 漏洞（其中三个可被利用）。消融研究表明，模糊测试空间模型对效果贡献最大。

Conclusion: ELFuzz 展现出巨大潜力，可以更自动化、高效和可扩展地生成输入以进行模糊测试。

Abstract: Generation-based fuzzing produces appropriate testing cases according to
specifications of input grammars and semantic constraints to test systems and
software. However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to
construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large
Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based
fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over
fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels
the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance.
Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of
real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2)
synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and
semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared
ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized
by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more
coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also
used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of
cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are
exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the
fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to
62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers
synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical
structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results
present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and
extensible input generation for fuzzing.

Motivation: To reinforce critical UAS systems by examining security vulnerabilities and enhancing UAS security comprehensively.

Method: Analyze both UAS-specific and non-UAS-specific mitigation strategies applicable within the UAS domain, present relevant cybersecurity standards and recommendations.

Result: Identification of several critical research gaps that require further investigation.

Conclusion: Discussions and recommendations for future exploration by the research community to address identified gaps.

Abstract: In the last decade, the rapid growth of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and
Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAV) in communication, defense, and transportation
has increased. The application of UAS will continue to increase rapidly. This
has led researchers to examine security vulnerabilities in various facets of
UAS infrastructure and UAVs, which form a part of the UAS system to reinforce
these critical systems. This survey summarizes the cybersecurity
vulnerabilities in several phases of UAV deployment, the likelihood of each
vulnerability's occurrence, the impact of attacks, and mitigation strategies
that could be applied. We go beyond the state-of-the-art by taking a
comprehensive approach to enhancing UAS security by performing an analysis of
both UAS-specific and non-UAS-specific mitigation strategies that are
applicable within the UAS domain to define the lessons learned. We also present
relevant cybersecurity standards and their recommendations in the UAS context.
Despite the significant literature in UAS security and the relevance of
cyberphysical and networked systems security approaches from the past, which we
identify in the survey, we find several critical research gaps that require
further investigation. These form part of our discussions and recommendations
for the future exploration by our research community.

### [136] [Adaptive Chosen-Ciphertext Security of Distributed Broadcast Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10338)
*Kwangsu Lee*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的分布式广播加密（DBE）方案，首次证明了适应性选择密文攻击（CCA）安全性，并且该方案在密文大小、私钥大小和公钥验证效率方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DBE方案仅在适应性选择明文攻击（CPA）安全模型下被证明，且在验证用户公钥时需要线性数量的配对操作，效率较低。因此，需要一种更高效的DBE方案，能够在保证安全性的同时减少计算开销。

Method: 首先提出了一种半静态CCA安全的DBE方案，并在$q$-Type假设下证明其安全性。然后通过修改Gentry和Waters的通用转换方法，将其应用于CCA安全的DBE方案，从而提出了一个适应性CCA安全的DBE方案。最终方案在双线性群中实现，具备恒定大小的密文和私钥，以及线性大小的公钥，同时公钥验证只需常数级别的配对操作和高效的群成员检查。

Result: 新提出的DBE方案在适应性CCA安全模型下得到了证明，同时实现了高效的公钥验证（常数级别的配对操作），并且密文和私钥的大小为常数级，公钥大小为线性级。

Conclusion: 本文提出的DBE方案不仅首次实现了适应性CCA安全性，还在密文大小、私钥大小和公钥验证效率方面具有显著优势，是一种高效且安全的分布式广播加密方案。

Abstract: Distributed broadcast encryption (DBE) is a specific kind of broadcast
encryption (BE) where users independently generate their own public and private
keys, and a sender can efficiently create a ciphertext for a subset of users by
using the public keys of the subset users. Previously proposed DBE schemes have
been proven in the adaptive chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security model and
have the disadvantage of requiring linear number of pairing operations when
verifying the public key of a user. In this paper, we propose an efficient DBE
scheme in bilinear groups and prove adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA)
security for the first time. To do this, we first propose a semi-static CCA
secure DBE scheme and prove the security under the $q$-Type assumption. Then,
by modifying the generic transformation of Gentry and Waters that converts a
semi-static CPA secure DBE scheme into an adaptive CPA secure DBE scheme to be
applied to CCA secure DBE schemes, we propose an adaptive CCA secure DBE scheme
and prove its adaptive CCA security. Our proposed DBE scheme is efficient
because it requires constant size ciphertexts, constant size private keys, and
linear size public keys, and the public key verification requires only a
constant number of pairing operations and efficient group membership checks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy concerns of sensitive graph data in cloud-based GCN services and optimize the computational overhead introduced by Homomorphic Encryption (HE).

Method: Propose FicGCN, which includes a latency-aware packing scheme, Sparse Intra-Ciphertext Aggregation (SpIntra-CA) method, and region-based data reordering to minimize rotation overhead and balance aggregation and combination operations.

Result: FicGCN achieved the best performance across all tested datasets, with up to a 4.10x improvement over the latest design.

Conclusion: FicGCN successfully harnesses the sparse characteristics of GCNs and optimizes performance in privacy-preserving machine learning.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) have gained widespread popularity
in various fields like personal healthcare and financial systems, due to their
remarkable performance. Despite the growing demand for cloud-based GCN
services, privacy concerns over sensitive graph data remain significant.
Homomorphic Encryption (HE) facilitates Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
(PPML) by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data. However, HE
introduces substantial computational overhead, particularly for GCN operations
that require rotations and multiplications in matrix products. The sparsity of
GCNs offers significant performance potential, but their irregularity
introduces additional operations that reduce practical gains. In this paper, we
propose FicGCN, a HE-based framework specifically designed to harness the
sparse characteristics of GCNs and strike a globally optimal balance between
aggregation and combination operations. FicGCN employs a latency-aware packing
scheme, a Sparse Intra-Ciphertext Aggregation (SpIntra-CA) method to minimize
rotation overhead, and a region-based data reordering driven by local adjacency
structure. We evaluated FicGCN on several popular datasets, and the results
show that FicGCN achieved the best performance across all tested datasets, with
up to a 4.10x improvement over the latest design.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs) due to loss reduction during fine-tuning, which can expose private information. This paper introduces SOFT, a defense mechanism that uses selective data obfuscation to protect privacy while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs often involves private or sensitive information, leading to significant privacy concerns when subjected to membership inference attacks.

Method: The authors propose SOFT, a technique that employs influential data selection with an adjustable parameter to balance between maintaining model performance and protecting privacy.

Result: SOFT effectively mitigates privacy leakage in fine-tuned LLMs across six different domains and various LLM architectures and scales, while retaining competitive model performance.

Conclusion: SOFT offers a practical and scalable solution for safeguarding sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs against membership inference attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely
adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often
involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns.
In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the
vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during
fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information.
These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT
(\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM
\textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates
privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable
parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive
experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales.
Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining
competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to
safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g.,
through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For
applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based
multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining
reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications
might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents.

### [140] [A Crack in the Bark: Leveraging Public Knowledge to Remove Tree-Ring Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10502)
*Junhua Lin,Marc Juarez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究人员提出了一种针对Tree-Ring水印技术的新攻击方法，该技术以高隐秘性和对去除攻击的强鲁棒性著称。新攻击方法利用训练目标扩散模型时使用的变分自编码器（通常是公开可用的），通过近似模型的中间潜在空间，实现更有效的代理攻击。评估显示此方法显著降低了Tree-Ring检测器的ROC和PR曲线下的AUC值，并且保持了高质量图像生成能力。此外，这种攻击效果优于那些假设完全访问扩散模型的方法，揭示了重用公共自编码器训练扩散模型所带来的安全风险以及Tree-Ring检测器在实际部署中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的针对Tree-Ring水印技术的去除攻击通常依赖于对攻击者能力的强烈假设，例如需要完全访问扩散模型。然而，这些条件在现实中可能难以满足。因此，研究者探索了一种仅需访问变分自编码器即可实施的有效攻击方法，从而降低对攻击者能力的要求，同时揭示当前行业实践中存在的潜在威胁。

Method: 研究者设计了一种基于变分自编码器的攻击方法。该方法利用扩散模型训练过程中使用的变分自编码器，近似模型的中间潜在空间，从而构建更有效的代理模型进行攻击。通过这种方式，攻击者无需完全访问扩散模型即可削弱Tree-Ring水印技术的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，新方法显著降低了Tree-Ring检测器的性能：ROC曲线下的AUC值从0.993降至0.153，PR曲线下的AUC值从0.994降至0.385。同时，生成的图像质量依然保持较高水平。与假设完全访问扩散模型的现有方法相比，新方法表现更优。此外，研究发现Tree-Ring检测器的精确度未能达到实际应用的要求。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，重用公共变分自编码器训练扩散模型存在安全隐患，而这一威胁尚未被当前行业实践充分考虑。此外，Tree-Ring检测器的精确度指标在先前评估中被忽视，其性能不足以支持实际部署。未来的研究应关注提高水印技术的鲁棒性和安全性，同时改进检测器的设计以满足实际应用需求。

Abstract: We present a novel attack specifically designed against Tree-Ring, a
watermarking technique for diffusion models known for its high imperceptibility
and robustness against removal attacks. Unlike previous removal attacks, which
rely on strong assumptions about attacker capabilities, our attack only
requires access to the variational autoencoder that was used to train the
target diffusion model, a component that is often publicly available. By
leveraging this variational autoencoder, the attacker can approximate the
model's intermediate latent space, enabling more effective surrogate-based
attacks. Our evaluation shows that this approach leads to a dramatic reduction
in the AUC of Tree-Ring detector's ROC and PR curves, decreasing from 0.993 to
0.153 and from 0.994 to 0.385, respectively, while maintaining high image
quality. Notably, our attacks outperform existing methods that assume full
access to the diffusion model. These findings highlight the risk of reusing
public autoencoders to train diffusion models -- a threat not considered by
current industry practices. Furthermore, the results suggest that the Tree-Ring
detector's precision, a metric that has been overlooked by previous
evaluations, falls short of the requirements for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their
deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak
attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense
mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a
promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is
fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework.
In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic
analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel,
multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key
dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to
assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and
experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail
approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide
insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured
foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled
advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails. The code is available at

### [142] [Assessing the Resilience of Automotive Intrusion Detection Systems to Adversarial Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10620)
*Stefano Longari,Paolo Cerracchio,Michele Carminati,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores gradient-based adversarial attacks on automotive intrusion detection systems (IDSs) under different knowledge scenarios (white-box, grey-box, black-box). It evaluates attack effectiveness on state-of-the-art IDSs using public datasets and studies the impact of perturbations and real-time feasibility. Results show that attack success depends on dataset quality, target IDS, and attacker's knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vehicles are vulnerable to cyberattacks due to the lack of robust security measures in CAN bus communication and increasing vehicle connectivity. Existing IDSs can be bypassed by adversarial attacks, especially evasion attacks, which manipulate inputs to avoid detection.

Method: The authors investigate gradient-based adversarial attacks against automotive IDSs across three knowledge scenarios: white-box (full system knowledge), grey-box (partial knowledge), and black-box (no internal IDS knowledge). They evaluate these attacks' effectiveness on two public datasets with state-of-the-art IDSs, study the influence of adversarial perturbations, and assess real-time feasibility through precomputed payloads for timed injection based on bus traffic.

Result: Results indicate that while automotive domain constraints make attacks challenging, their effectiveness heavily relies on dataset quality, the specific target IDS, and the degree of knowledge possessed by the attacker.

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks on automotive IDSs present significant challenges due to domain-specific constraints. Their success is contingent upon dataset quality, the targeted IDS, and the attacker's level of knowledge. These findings underscore the need for more robust IDSs and further research into defending against such attacks.

Abstract: The security of modern vehicles has become increasingly important, with the
controller area network (CAN) bus serving as a critical communication backbone
for various Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The absence of robust security
measures in CAN, coupled with the increasing connectivity of vehicles, makes
them susceptible to cyberattacks. While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been developed to counter such threats, they are not foolproof. Adversarial
attacks, particularly evasion attacks, can manipulate inputs to bypass
detection by IDSs. This paper extends our previous work by investigating the
feasibility and impact of gradient-based adversarial attacks performed with
different degrees of knowledge against automotive IDSs. We consider three
scenarios: white-box (attacker with full system knowledge), grey-box (partial
system knowledge), and the more realistic black-box (no knowledge of the IDS'
internal workings or data). We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
attacks against state-of-the-art IDSs on two publicly available datasets.
Additionally, we study effect of the adversarial perturbation on the attack
impact and evaluate real-time feasibility by precomputing evasive payloads for
timed injection based on bus traffic. Our results demonstrate that, besides
attacks being challenging due to the automotive domain constraints, their
effectiveness is strongly dependent on the dataset quality, the target IDS, and
the attacker's degree of knowledge.

*Stefano Longari,Alessandro Pozone,Jessica Leoni,Mario Polino,Michele Carminati,Mara Tanelli,Stefano Zanero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: In this paper, researchers propose CyFence - a new architecture that leverages the cyber-physical nature of CPS to improve resilience against cyber-attacks by adding a secure semantic check. Evaluated in a real-world application, it mitigates various attacks with minimal computation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many current defense strategies for Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) do not fully utilize the cyber-physical characteristics of these systems, which are increasingly exposed to cyber-attacks and thus entail high risks and potential safety harms.

Method: The proposed method is CyFence, a novel architecture enhancing the resilience of closed-loop control systems against cyber-attacks through adding a semantic check. This check ensures the system behaves as expected and its security is ensured using the Trusted Execution Environment provided by modern processors.

Result: CyFence was evaluated on a real-world application involving an active braking digital controller. The results showed it could effectively mitigate different types of cyber-attacks while introducing negligible computation overhead.

Conclusion: CyFence demonstrates effectiveness in improving the resilience of CPS against cyber-attacks by exploiting their inherent cyber-physical properties and ensuring security through trusted execution environments.

Abstract: In the last decades, Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs) have experienced a
significant technological evolution and increased connectivity, at the cost of
greater exposure to cyber-attacks. Since many CPS are used in safety-critical
systems, such attacks entail high risks and potential safety harms. Although
several defense strategies have been proposed, they rarely exploit the
cyber-physical nature of the system. In this work, we exploit the nature of CPS
by proposing CyFence, a novel architecture that improves the resilience of
closed-loop control systems against cyber-attacks by adding a semantic check,
used to confirm that the system is behaving as expected. To ensure the security
of the semantic check code, we use the Trusted Execution Environment
implemented by modern processors. We evaluate CyFence considering a real-world
application, consisting of an active braking digital controller, demonstrating
that it can mitigate different types of attacks with a negligible computation
overhead.

### [144] [From IOCs to Group Profiles: On the Specificity of Threat Group Behaviors in CTI Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10645)
*Aakanksha Saha,Martina Lindorfer,Juan Caballero*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现，仅依靠行为特征（如TTPs）进行威胁组织归因存在很大局限性，尽管增加信息源和数据可以提高覆盖率，但仍有大部分威胁组织缺乏独特的专属行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络安全领域逐渐从依赖短生命周期的妥协指标（IOCs）转向更持久的行为特征（如TTPs）。然而，这些行为特征的独特性和完整性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 1. 系统分析了来自MITRE ATT&CK和Malpedia两个公开CTI知识库中的威胁组织行为特征。
2. 评估了单一来源数据中具有独特行为特征的威胁组织比例。
3. 结合两个数据源，评估组合数据对威胁组织行为特征覆盖率的影响。
4. 增加利用漏洞和额外技术等信息，进一步增强行为特征集。

Result: 1. 在ATT&CK数据集中，仅有34%的威胁组织具有专属技术特征，而73%的组织使用专属软件。
2. 在Malpedia数据集中，这一比例降至24%。
3. 组合两个数据源后，覆盖率有所提升，但仍不足30%的组织具有专属行为特征。
4. 即使加入额外信息，仍有64%的组织没有任何专属行为特征。

Conclusion: 行为特征在威胁组织归因中的替代性受到质疑，因其覆盖范围有限且许多组织缺乏独特行为特征。未来可能需要结合其他类型的数据或方法来改进威胁归因能力。

Abstract: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domain
names are commonly used for threat detection and attribution. However, IOCs
tend to be short-lived as they are easy to change. As a result, the
cybersecurity community is shifting focus towards more persistent behavioral
profiles, such as the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and the
software used by a threat group. However, the distinctiveness and completeness
of such behavioral profiles remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
systematically analyze threat group profiles built from two open cyber threat
intelligence (CTI) knowledge bases: MITRE ATT&CK and Malpedia. We first
investigate what fraction of threat groups have group-specific behaviors, i.e.,
behaviors used exclusively by a single group. We find that only 34% of threat
groups in ATT&CK have group-specific techniques. The software used by a threat
group proves to be more distinctive, with 73% of ATT&CK groups using
group-specific software. However, this percentage drops to 24% in the broader
Malpedia dataset. Next, we evaluate how group profiles improve when data from
both sources are combined. While coverage improves modestly, the proportion of
groups with group-specific behaviors remains under 30%. We then enhance
profiles by adding exploited vulnerabilities and additional techniques
extracted from more threat reports. Despite the additional information, 64% of
groups still lack any group-specific behavior. Our findings raise concerns on
the belief that behavioral profiles can replace IOCs in threat group
attribution.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GOLIATH的基于区块链的去中心化框架，用于通过车载信息娱乐系统收集实时交通信息，解决了现有集中式解决方案中的单点故障和信任问题。该框架使用新的共识机制记录车辆位置信息，并在模拟环境中验证了其鲁棒性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统技术的进步使得车辆间可以交换实时数据，传统的道路信息收集方式已逐渐被基于车载传感器或智能手机的众包模式取代。然而现有的集中式解决方案存在单点故障和信任问题，需要一种去中心化的方案来保证信息收集和交换的信任度。

Method: 设计了一个基于区块链的去中心化框架GOLIATH，运行在车载信息娱乐系统上，通过网络参与者之间交换的实时信息进行交通数据的收集。每辆车以交易的形式在账本上分享自身及其邻居的位置信息，并采用新型共识机制验证这些信息。此外，该共识机制具有抵抗多种攻击的能力。

Result: 在模拟但真实的环境中评估了所提出的框架，考虑了不同的威胁模型，展示了其鲁棒性和安全特性。证明了该方法在车辆定位和交通信息管理方面的可行性。

Conclusion: GOLIATH框架提供了一种有效的去中心化解决方案，能够克服现有集中式众包交通信息系统的局限性，保证了信息收集和交换的可信度，同时利用了车辆固有的分布式特性。

Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) technology has advanced during the
past years, and it is now used for several applications that require vehicles
to exchange real-time data, such as in traffic information management.
Traditionally, road traffic information has been collected using on-site
sensors. However, crowd-sourcing traffic information from onboard sensors or
smartphones has become a viable alternative. State-of-the-art solutions
currently follow a centralized model where only the service provider has
complete access to the collected traffic data and represent a single point of
failure and trust. In this paper, we propose GOLIATH, a blockchain-based
decentralized framework that runs on the In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system
to collect real-time information exchanged between the network's participants.
Our approach mitigates the limitations of existing crowd-sourcing centralized
solutions by guaranteeing trusted information collection and exchange, fully
exploiting the intrinsic distributed nature of vehicles. We demonstrate its
feasibility in the context of vehicle positioning and traffic information
management. Each vehicle participating in the decentralized network shares its
position and neighbors' ones in the form of a transaction recorded on the
ledger, which uses a novel consensus mechanism to validate it. We design the
consensus mechanism resilient against a realistic set of adversaries that aim
to tamper or disable the communication. We evaluate the proposed framework in a
simulated (but realistic) environment, which considers different threats and
allows showing its robustness and safety properties.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管承诺方案（CSs）的单独属性和多方计算（MPC）提供的保证已被广泛研究，但它们在具体协议和应用中的相互关系仍 largely 未被深入探索。

Method: 通过分析承诺方案与多方计算之间的关系，重点研究安全性属性及其对高层MPC的影响，调查不同类型CS对各种MPC构造的贡献以及其与实际应用的关系。

Conclusion: 精心选择承诺方案以满足多方计算的对抗性和功能要求对于实现更强大和隐私保护的加密应用至关重要。

Abstract: The paper presents an analysis of Commitment Schemes (CSs) used in
Multi-Party Computation (MPC) protocols. While the individual properties of CSs
and the guarantees offered by MPC have been widely studied in isolation, their
interrelation in concrete protocols and applications remains mostly
underexplored. This paper presents the relation between the two, with an
emphasis on (security) properties and their impact on the upper layer MPC. In
particular, we investigate how different types of CSs contribute to various MPC
constructions and their relation to real-life applications of MPC. The paper
can also serve as a tutorial for understanding the cryptographic interplay
between CS and MPC, making it accessible to both researchers and practitioners.
Our findings emphasize the importance of carefully selecting CS to meet the
adversarial and functional requirements of MPC, thereby aiming for more robust
and privacy-preserving cryptographic applications

*Xiaoxing Mo,Yuxuan Cheng,Nan Sun,Leo Yu Zhang,Wei Luo,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DNNs容易受到后门攻击，TED是一种检测手段，但其对适应性攻击较为脆弱。本文提出TED-LaST，通过标签监督动力学跟踪和自适应层强调增强TED的鲁棒性，能有效检测到包括Adap-Blend、Adapt-Patch等复杂后门攻击，为DNN安全提供新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNNs）在训练过程中可能被植入隐藏触发器，从而遭受恶意的后门攻击。虽然Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) 是一种强大的检测工具，但它可能对适应性地扭曲网络层拓扑表示分布的后门攻击较为脆弱。

Method: 提出了TED-LaST策略，包含两个关键创新：1）标签监督动力学跟踪；2）自适应层强调。同时，对最先进的适应性攻击中的数据投毒技巧进行了回顾和分类，并提出了带有目标映射的增强型适应性攻击，可以动态转移恶意任务并充分利用适应性攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10、GTSRB、ImageNet100）和模型架构（ResNet20、ResNet101）上的全面实验表明，TED-LaST能够有效对抗复杂的后门攻击如Adap-Blend、Adapt-Patch以及提出的增强型适应性攻击。

Conclusion: TED-LaST为鲁棒后门检测设定了新的标准，显著提高了DNN对进化威胁的安全性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model
behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a
powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be
vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological
representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation,
we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow
release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that
enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key
innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis.
These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade
traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological
space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data
poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced
adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious
tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and
ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST
effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch,
and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for
robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against
evolving threats.

### [148] [ObfusBFA: A Holistic Approach to Safeguarding DNNs from Different Types of Bit-Flip Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10744)
*Xiaobei Yan,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ObfusBFA is a methodology that mitigates bit-flip attacks on DNNs by introducing random dummy operations during model inference, turning targeted attacks into random bit flips and protecting both high-level model weights and low-level codebase. It consistently preserves model accuracy, reduces attack success rates, and introduces minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bit-flip attacks can significantly degrade the accuracy of DNNs or mislead predictions. Current defenses are not effective across different scenarios and platforms.

Method: ObfusBFA introduces random dummy operations during model inference to transform targeted bit-flip attacks into random ones, making it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Novel algorithms are used to identify critical bits and insert obfuscation operations.

Result: ObfusBFA effectively preserves model accuracy across various datasets and DNN architectures, significantly reduces attack success rates, and introduces minimal latency and storage overhead.

Conclusion: ObfusBFA provides an efficient and holistic defense against bit-flip attacks targeting both high-level model weights and low-level codebase in DNNs, with practical applicability due to minimal overhead.

Abstract: Bit-flip attacks (BFAs) represent a serious threat to Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs), where flipping a small number of bits in the model parameters or binary
code can significantly degrade the model accuracy or mislead the model
prediction in a desired way. Existing defenses exclusively focus on protecting
models for specific attacks and platforms, while lacking effectiveness for
other scenarios. We propose ObfusBFA, an efficient and holistic methodology to
mitigate BFAs targeting both the high-level model weights and low-level
codebase (executables or shared libraries). The key idea of ObfusBFA is to
introduce random dummy operations during the model inference, which effectively
transforms the delicate attacks into random bit flips, making it much harder
for attackers to pinpoint and exploit vulnerable bits. We design novel
algorithms to identify critical bits and insert obfuscation operations. We
evaluate ObfusBFA against different types of attacks, including the adaptive
scenarios where the attacker increases the flip bit budget to attempt to
circumvent our defense. The results show that ObfusBFA can consistently
preserve the model accuracy across various datasets and DNN architectures while
significantly reducing the attack success rates. Additionally, it introduces
minimal latency and storage overhead, making it a practical solution for
real-world applications.

### [149] [Quantifying Azure RBAC Wildcard Overreach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10755)
*Christophe Parisel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Belshazaar is a two-stage framework that solves the effective permission set problem and evaluates wildcard permissions spread in Azure RBAC. It reveals significant cross Resource Provider reach and privilege bloat from wildcards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Azure RBAC uses wildcard permissions which can obscure allowed operations and undermine least-privilege guarantees.

Method: Formalize Azure action syntax with a context free grammar, expand wildcards into explicit action sets, and define an ultrametric diameter metric to measure semantic overreach.

Result: About 39 percent of actions have cross Resource Provider reach when associated with non-obvious wildcards, and effective permission sets are computable.

Conclusion: Wildcard patterns introduce privilege bloat but Belshazaar offers a scalable approach for tighter RBAC policies.

Abstract: Azure RBAC leverages wildcard permissions to simplify policy authoring, but
this abstraction often obscures the actual set of allowed operations and
undermines least-privilege guarantees. We introduce Belshazaar, a two-stage
framework that targets both the effective permission set problem and the
evaluation of wildcards permissions spread. First, we formalize Azure action
syntax via a context free grammar and implement a compiler that expands any
wildcard into its explicit action set. Second, we define an ultrametric
diameter metric to quantify semantic overreach in wildcard scenarios. Applied
to Microsoft s official catalog of 15481 actions, Belshazaar reveals that about
39 percent of actions admit a cross Resource Provider reach when associated
with non obvious wildcards, and that effective permissions sets are effectively
computable. These findings demonstrate that wildcard patterns can introduce
substantial privilege bloat, and that our approach offers a scalable, semantics
driven path toward tighter, least-privilege RBAC policies in Azure
environments.

### [150] [ME: Trigger Element Combination Backdoor Attack on Copyright Infringement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10776)
*Feiyu Yang,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of copyright infringement attacks on generative diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. It proposes new datasets and an enhanced Multi-Element (ME) attack method based on SilentBadDiffusion (SBD). The ME attack increases the number of poisonous visual-text elements per sample and uses Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for stealthiness. Results show improvements over SBD in terms of Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) and First Attack Epoch (FAE), especially under low subsampling ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to improve the effectiveness of copyright infringement attacks on text-to-image generative models, given the limitations of current datasets and the suboptimal performance of existing methods like SilentBadDiffusion (SBD).

Method: The authors developed two new datasets suitable for researching attacks similar to SBD. They also introduced a Multi-Element (ME) attack method which enhances SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text elements per poisoned sample and applying Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to maintain stealthiness.

Result: On the newly created datasets, the proposed ME attack achieved CIR/FAE results of 16.78%/39.50 and 51.20%/23.60, comparable to or better than benchmark datasets. Under a low subsampling ratio of 5%, MESI and DCT showed superior performance with CIR/FAE of 0.23%/84.00 and 12.73%/65.50 respectively, outperforming original SBD which failed completely.

Conclusion: The proposed ME attack method combined with DCT demonstrates enhanced capabilities for launching copyright infringement attacks on generative diffusion models, particularly effective even at low subsampling ratios.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion
(SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to
launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text
pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew
outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the
feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even
constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or
inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are
suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art
(SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning
samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets
accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME)
attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text
elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while
importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain
the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch
(FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60,

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 当前LLM安全防御在分解攻击下失效，因为现有技术仅检测即时提示中的危害，无法推理长期意图。我们提出增加一个外部监控器以更高粒度观察对话，并创建了最大、最多样化的数据集来研究监控分解攻击。通过测试前沿LLM，我们发现分解攻击非常有效。我们还提出了一种轻量级的顺序监控框架，可以有效地防御分解攻击，降低成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的浅层安全对齐技术只能检测即时提示中的危害，无法识别跨越多个看似无害指令的恶意意图，因此在分解攻击下面临挑战。

Method: 1. 创建了一个包含问答、文本到图像和代理任务的最大、最多样化数据集。
2. 提出并实现了一个轻量级的顺序监控框架，累积评估每个子任务。
3. 使用精心设计的提示工程方法构建了一个轻量级监控器。

2. 轻量级监控器实现了93%的防御成功率，优于推理模型。
3. 监控器对随机任务注入具有鲁棒性，同时将成本降低90%，延迟减少50%。

Conclusion: 轻量级顺序监控器在缓解分解攻击方面非常有效，且易于部署。

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

### [153] [Structure and asymptotic preserving deep neural surrogates for uncertainty quantification in multiscale kinetic equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10636)
*Wei Chen,Giacomo Dimarco,Lorenzo Pareschi*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional kinetic equations with stochastic parameters in uncertainty quantification (UQ), this paper proposes a multiscale control variates strategy and surrogate models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs). The approach reduces variance, maintains physical consistency, and improves accuracy and efficiency compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Monte Carlo sampling methods for uncertainty quantification suffer from slow convergence and high variance, particularly as the dimensionality of the parameter space grows. This necessitates more efficient and accurate approaches to handle high-dimensional kinetic equations with stochastic parameters.

Method: The paper adopts a multiscale control variates strategy that uses low-fidelity solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance in Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, it introduces surrogate models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs) which are designed to satisfy key physical properties such as positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and asymptotic limits. These SAPNNs are trained on low-fidelity models and enriched with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation.

Result: Numerical results show that the proposed methodology achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical consistency and asymptotic accuracy. It enables efficient large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ across both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard Monte Carlo techniques.

Conclusion: The multiscale control variates strategy combined with SAPNN-based surrogate models provides an effective solution to the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional kinetic equations with stochastic parameters. This approach enhances the efficiency and accuracy of uncertainty quantification in kinetic equations.

Abstract: The high dimensionality of kinetic equations with stochastic parameters poses
major computational challenges for uncertainty quantification (UQ). Traditional
Monte Carlo (MC) sampling methods, while widely used, suffer from slow
convergence and high variance, which become increasingly severe as the
dimensionality of the parameter space grows. To accelerate MC sampling, we
adopt a multiscale control variates strategy that leverages low-fidelity
solutions from simplified kinetic models to reduce variance. To further improve
sampling efficiency and preserve the underlying physics, we introduce surrogate
models based on structure and asymptotic preserving neural networks (SAPNNs).
These deep neural networks are specifically designed to satisfy key physical
properties, including positivity, conservation laws, entropy dissipation, and
asymptotic limits. By training the SAPNNs on low-fidelity models and enriching
them with selected high-fidelity samples from the full Boltzmann equation, our
method achieves significant variance reduction while maintaining physical
consistency and asymptotic accuracy. The proposed methodology enables efficient
large-scale prediction in kinetic UQ and is validated across both homogeneous
and nonhomogeneous multiscale regimes. Numerical results demonstrate improved
accuracy and computational efficiency compared to standard MC techniques.

TL;DR: 在设施选址问题中，研究了最大化代理人间公平性的策略证明机制。由于不可能有策略证明机制能够限制最优Gini指数的近似比率，文章建议计算效用的补Gini指数的近似比率，并分析确定性和随机化机制的表现。同时，还探讨了机制对Nash福利的近似程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文献通常使用Gini指数衡量公平性，但缺乏对策略证明机制在效用的最优Gini指数上限制近似比率的能力的研究。

Method: 1. 证明不存在能够限制最优Gini指数近似比率的策略证明机制。
2. 提出计算效用的补Gini指数的近似比率。
3. 分析确定性和随机化机制对补Gini指数和Nash福利的近似程度。

Result: - 证明了不可能存在能够限制最优Gini指数近似比率的策略证明机制。
- 确定性和随机化机制在近似补Gini指数和Nash福利方面具有不同程度的效果。

Conclusion: 策略证明机制无法限制最优Gini指数的近似比率，但可以通过计算补Gini指数的近似比率来评估公平性。此外，机制对Nash福利的近似程度可以作为另一个衡量标准。

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize
equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure
equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental
impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the
approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more
facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the
complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic
and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is
often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and
utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash
welfare.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) offer a novel pathway for quantum machine
learning, yet their practical application is hindered by inherent limitations
such as constrained linear expressivity, optimization challenges, and acute
sensitivity to quantum hardware noise. This work introduces VQC-MLPNet, a
scalable and robust hybrid quantum-classical architecture designed to overcome
these obstacles. By innovatively employing quantum circuits to dynamically
generate parameters for classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via amplitude
encoding and parameterized quantum operations, VQC-MLPNet substantially expands
representation capabilities and augments training stability. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees via statistical learning techniques and Neural
Tangent Kernel analysis, explicitly deriving upper bounds on approximation,
uniform deviation, and optimization errors. These theoretical insights
demonstrate exponential improvements in representation capacity relative to
quantum circuit depth and the number of qubits, providing clear computational
advantages over standalone quantum circuits and existing hybrid quantum
architectures. Our theoretical claims are empirically corroborated through
extensive experiments, including classifying semiconductor quantum-dot charge
states and predicting genomic transcription factor binding sites, demonstrating
resilient performance even under realistic IBM quantum noise simulations. This
research establishes a theoretically sound and practically robust framework,
advancing the frontiers of quantum-enhanced learning for unconventional
computing paradigms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era and beyond.

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) face limitations due to the lack of natural language interfaces. Although advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved autoformalization, current methods still lack sentence-level verification. This paper proposes StepProof, a method for granular, step-by-step verification that breaks down proofs into verifiable subproofs, significantly improving proof success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of existing autoformalization approaches which are only able to verify complete proofs but not finer, sentence-level verification.

Method: StepProof is a novel autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification. It breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs, enabling sentence-level verification.

Result: Experimental results show that StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Manual adjustments to natural language proofs also enhanced StepProof's performance.

Conclusion: StepProof addresses the gap in current autoformalization methods by providing granular, step-by-step verification, leading to significant improvements in proof success rates and efficiency.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal
verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their
lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of
natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of
translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified.
Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited
to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level
verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel
autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification.
StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs,
enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that
StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to
traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to
the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification,
further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language
models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny
reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates
that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal
resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement
learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B
parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve
reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA
RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved
at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing
SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning
performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD
post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our
work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA.
We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various
ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from
LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded
by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In
service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code,
training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Resa, a family of reasoning models trained with SAE-Tuning. This method efficiently elicits strong reasoning abilities from language models at a low cost and short time, while maintaining high performance. It also demonstrates generality and modularity in the extracted reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore cost-effective methods for eliciting strong reasoning abilities in language models by leveraging their underlying representations.

Method: Developed SAE-Tuning, a novel and efficient sparse autoencoder tuning procedure. First, an SAE is trained to capture reasoning abilities from a source model. Then, the trained SAE guides a supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in a target model using verified question-answer data without reasoning traces.

Result: SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x and training time by >450x. When applied to lightly RL-trained models, it achieves significant reasoning performance like 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 with minimal additional cost.

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning is a highly efficient method for eliciting reasoning abilities in language models. The extracted reasoning abilities are both generalizable and modular.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly

scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and

TL;DR: The paper explores semantic degeneracy in natural language and its impact on Large Language Models (LLMs) using Kolmogorov complexity. It argues that meaning is observer-dependent, not inherent in linguistic forms. Through a semantic Bell inequality test with LLMs, the study reveals non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation, suggesting classical frequentist methods are insufficient for analyzing natural language. Instead, Bayesian-style approaches are proposed as more appropriate for characterizing linguistic meaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of LLMs and other NLP systems due to semantic degeneracy in natural language, which leads to multiple potential interpretations as expressions grow in complexity.

Method: Employed Kolmogorov complexity theory to argue about the interpretive constraints imposed by semantic degeneracy. Conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents as 'computational cognitive systems' to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings.

Result: Found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with some runs significantly violating the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$). Demonstrated that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity exhibits non-classical contextuality.

Conclusion: Classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are inherently lossy. Proposed Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches as more practical and suitable for characterizing linguistic meaning in context.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: For superhuman-capable models, obtaining high-quality human supervision is difficult or impossible.

Method: The method uses the ICM algorithm to fine-tune pretrained language models using their own generated labels instead of external supervision.

Result: ICM matches the performance of golden supervision and outperforms crowdsourced human supervision on several tasks, including GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks. Also, it improves the training of advanced LMs such as a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant.

Conclusion: The ICM method can effectively fine-tune language models without external supervision and even improve the training of frontier LMs.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Motivation: Human capital is crucial for corporate value creation but lacks well-defined measurement or disclosure rules.

Method: A machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on confirmed human capital disclosures was used to develop a comprehensive list of human capital-related keywords classified into five subcategories.

Result: A HC lexicon consisting of keywords categorized under DEI, health and safety, labor relations and culture, compensation and benefits, and demographics and other has been developed along with shared resources like disclosures, Python code, and examples.

Conclusion: The authors provide researchers with tools to study human capital questions and discuss future research opportunities.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在解决复杂数学问题上表现出色，但在简单的两人游戏推理任务中却表现不佳。本文提出TTT-Bench基准测试，评估LRMs在战略、空间和逻辑推理上的能力，发现擅长数学的模型在这些简单游戏中经常失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型（LRMs）在STEM领域表现出强大的推理能力，但其在更广泛任务领域的推理能力尚未充分探索。因此，研究者希望设计一种基准来评估LRMs在基础战略、空间和逻辑推理方面的能力。

Method: 引入TTT-Bench，一个包含四个类似井字棋的双人游戏的新基准测试，用于评估LRMs的基础战略、空间和逻辑推理能力。采用可扩展的编程方法生成可验证的双人游戏问题。

Result: 在TTT-Bench上评估了一系列最先进的LRMs，结果表明擅长解决高难度数学问题的模型往往无法通过这些简单的推理游戏。与MATH 500和AIME 2024相比，模型在TTT-Bench上的得分分别下降了41%和5%，且大多数模型在长期战略性推理情况下表现挣扎。

Conclusion: TTT-Bench揭示了现有LRMs在基础推理任务中的局限性，尤其是在长期战略推理方面，提示未来研究需要进一步提升模型在这类任务上的表现。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Motivation: To address the lack of diverse and balanced datasets for hate-speech detection in Portuguese, especially for legally protected minority groups.

Method: A four-stage pipeline including a manually curated seed, few-shot expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM, paraphrase-based augmentation, and enrichment with neutral texts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate strong performance and robust generalization in both binary and multi-label classification tasks across different domains.

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT is publicly released to promote research on synthetic data and hate-speech detection in low-resource settings.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

### [167] [Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10268)
*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions by showing they can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making and proposes a method to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic patterns in Gibbs sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit the question of whether language models possess Bayesian brains and challenge the assumption that they make probabilistic decisions similar to sampling from unknown distributions.

Method: The authors experiment on various large language models to identify their decision patterns under different circumstances and propose an approach to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling.

Result: The findings indicate that language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making even with non-zero sampling temperature, challenging previous methods for eliciting human-like priors and demonstrating the convergence to a 'false prior' without proper scrutiny.

Conclusion: Language models do not necessarily make probabilistic decisions and the proposed method helps prevent the inference of misleading language model priors.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

### [168] [ClusterUCB: Efficient Gradient-Based Data Selection for Targeted Fine-Tuning of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10288)
*Zige Wang,Qi Zhu,Fei Mi,Minghui Xu,Ruochun Jin,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gradient-based data influence approximation is crucial for selecting useful data in fine-tuning large language models, but it's resource-intensive. This paper proposes ClusterUCB, an efficient framework combining clustering and a modified UCB algorithm to reduce computation while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper stems from the need to make gradient-based data selection more feasible by reducing its high computational requirements without sacrificing the quality of data selection in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.

Method: The method involves clustering training data based on similar gradient features and framing inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation problem, solved with a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm that records historical data influence information and uses a cold start strategy.

Result: Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework, ClusterUCB, achieves comparable outcomes to original gradient-based methods but significantly reduces computational consumption.

Conclusion: ClusterUCB provides an efficient alternative to traditional gradient-based data selection methods for large language model fine-tuning, balancing exploration and exploitation while cutting down on resources.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [169] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flick is a new method for few-label text classification in low-resource linguistic contexts, which refines pseudo-labels to improve quality and mitigate errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for few-label text classification either focus on resource-rich languages or involve complex models prone to overfitting. There is a need for a more effective approach to handle noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation in truly low-resource settings.

Method: Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label refinement component that distils high-confidence pseudo-labels from an initial broad set of clusters by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and using an adaptive top-k selection mechanism.

Result: Flick demonstrates superior performance and adaptability across 14 diverse datasets, including challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana.

Conclusion: Flick provides a robust solution for few-label text classification in low-resource contexts, significantly improving pseudo-label quality and reducing error propagation.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过利用程序执行确定性生成高质量链式思维监督数据集的可扩展方法，实验表明该方法能有效增强LLM在不同任务中的推理能力，并减少推理过程中的无意义重复和过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理数据集生成方法要么依赖昂贵的人工注释，要么依赖易出错的LLM生成的链式思维，无法可靠地获得准确的推理监督。

Method: 通过利用程序执行的确定性，从代码执行中提取可验证的、逐步推理轨迹，并将其转换为自然语言链式思维推理，从而生成高质量的CoT监督数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够有效地使LLM具备跨任务的可转移推理能力；消融研究表明，该方法产生的推理数据高度准确，并且减少了推理过程中整体token长度，降低了无意义重复和过度思考。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为生成高质量CoT监督数据提供了一种新的途径，有助于提升LLM的推理能力和效率。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

### [171] [PAG: Multi-Turn Reinforced LLM Self-Correction with Policy as Generative Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10406)
*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a framework enabling Large Language Models to self-correct through a unified reinforcement learning process with selective revision, improving both reasoning and verification abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models face challenges in reliably verifying their own outputs. Current solutions either rely on separate verifier models or involve complex multi-stage training pipelines, restricting scalability.

Method: The proposed method, PAG, integrates policy and verifier roles within a single multi-turn reinforcement learning framework. It employs a selective revision mechanism where the model revises its answer only upon detecting an error during its generative verification step.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate PAG's improvements in both direct generation and self-correction accuracy as a policy, and superior self-verification compared to self-consistency as a verifier.

Conclusion: PAG represents a simple and effective approach for empowering LLMs to self-correct, jointly enhancing their reasoning and verification capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

*Sangmin Song,Juhwan Choi,JungMin Yun,YoungBin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本对话状态跟踪（DST）中表现出色，但其在多用户场景中的表现较差。本研究通过基于言语行为理论生成第二用户的语句来扩展现有的DST数据集，发现LLMs在此复杂场景下的性能显著下降，强调了未来研究增强LLMs以应对多用户DST场景的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在单用户DST任务上表现出色，但现有的DST基准测试主要关注结构化的用户-代理对话，未能充分反映现实世界中多用户交互的复杂性。因此，有必要评估LLMs在多用户DST场景中的鲁棒性，并探索如何降低数据集构建成本。

Method: 受LLM驱动的数据标注最新进展启发，研究者基于言语行为理论生成第二用户的语句，将这些语句系统地整合到对话中，从而扩展现有的DST数据集，实现对LLMs在多用户设置下性能的可控评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，在多用户DST场景下，LLMs的性能相较于单用户DST有显著下降，显示出当前LLMs在处理多说话人对话状态提取和跟踪时的局限性。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了LLMs在多用户DST场景中的不足，并强调未来研究应致力于提升LLMs的能力，以适应更复杂的多用户交互环境，从而推动更现实、更稳健的DST模型的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the RRP framework which mines knowledge graphs and combines LLMs' semantic strengths with structural information to generate high-quality reasoning paths, improving LLMs' reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual knowledge but still struggle with solving complex questions.

Method: The RRP framework mines the knowledge graph by combining the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. It also includes a rethinking module that evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.

Result: Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities in a plug-and-play manner.

Conclusion: RRP distills effective guidance for LLM reasoning by generating high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard individuals in distress, promote mental health and prevent harm or loss of life by identifying effective methods to detect life-threatening language.

Method: Fine-tuning three open-source LLMs (Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2) on datasets with balanced, imbalanced, and extremely imbalanced classes and comparing their performance with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Upsampling technique is used to handle imbalanced data.

Result: LLMs outperform traditional methods, with Mistral and Llama-2 being the top performers in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios. The upsampling technique benefits traditional approaches more than LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs show great potential for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world

TL;DR: PREMISE is a prompt-only framework that reduces reasoning overhead in large reasoning models without modifying model weights, achieving significant reductions in token usage and cost while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought reasoning, but this leads to unnecessarily verbose traces, inflating token usage and cost which limits deployment in certain settings.

Method: PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundant computation. It optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search balancing token length and answer validity. The method operates in a single-pass black-box interface applicable directly to commercial LLMs.

Result: On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 datasets, PREMISE matches or exceeds baseline accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by up to 87.5% and cutting costs by 69--82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization via PREMISE is a practical and scalable way to achieve efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

*Viet Anh Trinh,Xinlu He,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a large language model (LLM) revision mechanism to correct named entity errors in ASR predictions, achieving up to 30% relative WER reduction on the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems still have high word error rates (WER) for named entities, which are critical keywords. Misrecognizing them can significantly impact downstream applications.

Method: Introduce a LLM revision mechanism that uses the reasoning ability of LLMs and local context (e.g., lecture notes) with correct named entities to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions.

Result: On the introduced NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, the proposed technique achieves up to 30% relative WER reduction for named entities.

Conclusion: The LLM revision mechanism effectively reduces named entity errors in ASR, improving the overall performance of ASR systems in contexts where named entities are crucial.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

*Qingyan Wei,Yaojie Zhang,Zhiyuan Liu,Dongrui Liu,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Diffusion-based语言模型（dLLMs）通过并行生成token显著减少推理延迟，但现有的采样策略存在静态行为的问题。本文提出了SlowFast Sampling动态采样策略，结合三个原则：确定性原则、收敛性原则和位置性原则，以及dLLM-Cache以减少冗余计算。实验表明，该方法在LLaDA上实现高达15.63倍的速度提升，并在结合缓存时达到34.22倍的加速，同时在吞吐量方面优于强大的自回归基线模型如LLaMA3 8B。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散语言模型具有并行生成token的优势，但现有的采样策略如基于置信度或半自回归解码通常表现出静态行为，导致效率低下且灵活性有限。因此需要一种新的动态采样策略来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为SlowFast Sampling的新动态采样策略，该策略通过适应性地在探索性和加速解码阶段之间交替进行操作，并遵循三个指导原则：确定性原则、收敛性原则和位置性原则。此外，还将该策略与dLLM-Cache集成，以减少冗余计算。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上的广泛实验表明，SlowFast Sampling在LLaDA上实现了高达15.63倍的速度提升，同时准确率下降很小；当与缓存结合使用时，速度提升可达34.22倍。此外，其吞吐量表现优于强大的自回归基线模型LLaMA3 8B。

Conclusion: 精心设计的采样策略可以充分释放dLLMs的潜力，实现快速且高质量的生成。SlowFast Sampling展示了在效率和性能方面的显著优势，为未来的研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain

is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Domain2Vec, a method that breaks down datasets into meta-domains to optimize language model pretraining data mixtures without additional training. It operates under the DA² assumption and improves downstream task performance with less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying the optimal data mixture for language model pretraining in an efficient manner, avoiding extra computational costs.

Method: Domain2Vec decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of meta-domains using a classifier. It generates domain vectors representing distributions over a vocabulary of these meta-domains, aligning data distributions under the DA² assumption.

Result: Experiments show Domain2Vec can achieve the same validation loss on Pile-CC with only 51.5% of the computation compared to original methods. Under the same compute budget, it improves downstream performance by an average of 2.83%.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec is effective in optimizing data mixtures for language model pretraining, improving efficiency and scalability while maintaining or enhancing performance.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

### [184] [Generalization or Hallucination? Understanding Out-of-Context Reasoning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887)
*Yixiao Huang,Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Jiantao Jiao,Somayeh Sojoudi,Michael I. Jordan,Stuart Russell,Song Mei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) can generalize new facts but also hallucinate incorrect information due to out-of-context reasoning (OCR). Experiments across five LLMs confirm OCR drives both generalization and hallucination. A one-layer transformer with factorized matrices can solve synthetic factual recall tasks, highlighting the role of matrix factorization in learning associations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models exhibit remarkable generalization from new facts yet are prone to hallucinating incorrect information.

Method: Argue that both behaviors stem from out-of-context reasoning (OCR), formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task, use a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and value matrices to solve this task, and conduct theoretical analysis on the implicit bias of gradient descent.

Result: Experiments confirm that OCR drives both generalization and hallucination depending on causal relations, and matrix factorization plays a crucial role in learning associations efficiently.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering insights into analyzing and mitigating undesirable behaviors in knowledge injection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

### [185] [Decomposing MLP Activations into Interpretable Features via Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10920)
*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to decompose MLP activations in LLMs, leading to interpretable features that outperform sparse autoencoders and align with human-interpretable concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current methods for finding interpretable directions in activation space, such as sparse autoencoders' struggles in causal evaluations and lack of intrinsic interpretability.

Method: Directly decomposing MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), ensuring learned features are sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons mapped to their activating inputs.

Result: SNMF derived features outperform sparse autoencoders and a supervised baseline on causal steering tasks, align with human-interpretable concepts, and reveal hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space.

Conclusion: SNMF is presented as an effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in large language models.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven data science agents are limited by rigid workflows and inflexible coding strategies, which restrict their effectiveness to simple problems and prevent them from matching human practitioners' expertise on complex tasks.

Method: AutoMind incorporates three key advances: a curated expert knowledge base, an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm, and a self-adaptive coding strategy to address the limitations of current frameworks.

Result: AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines on two automated data science benchmarks. It also demonstrates favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents an efficient and robust step toward achieving fully automated data science.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHA systems are becoming more susceptible to automated attacks driven by deep learning techniques. Current adversarial attack methods often distort images in ways that hinder human interpretation and have limited applicability when initial input images are unavailable.

Method: The UAC framework generates adversarial examples guided by attacker-specified text prompts using a Large Language Model (LLM). For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a diffusion model for better image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially in black-box scenarios, BP-UAC employs a two-step optimization strategy using multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across various systems while producing natural CAPTCHAs that are indistinguishable to both humans and deep neural networks.

Conclusion: The proposed UAC framework significantly enhances the diversity and effectiveness of adversarial CAPTCHA generation, providing robust solutions for both targeted and untargeted attacks.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are

enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a

*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models are great for image synthesis, but maintaining diversity in generated samples is difficult. This paper proposes SPARKE, a method that uses conditional entropy for diversity guidance to improve the variety of generated images without significant computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge of ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models, especially when dealing with broad semantic spectrums and semantically similar prompts.

Method: The paper introduces SPARKE, which utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance. It dynamically conditions diversity measurement on similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. The method also focuses on Conditional latent Rényi Kernel Entropy Score Guidance to reduce computational complexity from O(n^3) to O(n).

Result: SPARKE improves the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant computational costs, as demonstrated through numerical tests on several text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: SPARKE is an effective method for enhancing the diversity of generated samples in prompt-guided diffusion models while maintaining low computational costs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

Motivation: 当前在有限标记数据情况下，判别器性能可能受限，需要一种有效的数据增强策略来提升其性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为ScoreMix的数据增强策略，该策略通过在扩散采样过程中凸性混合来自不同类别条件轨迹的分数，生成具有挑战性的合成样本。同时，研究了用于混合的类别选择策略，特别是关注那些在判别器嵌入空间中距离较远的类别组合。

Result: ScoreMix 方法在所有研究基准中显著提升了判别能力。并且实验证明生成器学习到的条件空间和判别器的嵌入空间之间的相关性很小。该方法不需要广泛的参数调整即可实现性能改进。

Conclusion: ScoreMix 是一种简单而有效的数据增强策略，可以显著提高判别器性能，特别适用于标记数据有限的情况，同时避免了对大数据集的依赖。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

TL;DR: 本研究评估了使用迁移学习和不确定性量化（UQ）在HAM10000数据集上的深度学习皮肤病变分类方法。结果表明，基于CLIP的视觉转换器与SVM结合具有最佳分类性能，而集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理之间提供了良好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确可靠的皮肤癌诊断对于早期治疗和改善患者预后至关重要。然而，深度学习模型的性能可能受到数据稀缺和缺乏不确定性意识的限制。因此，研究者希望通过对不同模型及不确定性的综合评估来提升诊断系统的性能和可靠性。

Method: 研究分两个阶段进行：第一阶段，基准测试多个预训练特征提取器（如CLIP变体、ResNet50、DenseNet121等）与传统分类器（如SVM、XGBoost等）的组合；第二阶段，通过蒙特卡洛Dropout (MCD)、集成方法(Ensemble)和集成蒙特卡洛Dropout (EMCD)引入不确定性量化，并使用一系列不确定性感知指标进行评估。

Result: 结果显示，基于CLIP的视觉转换器与SVM结合实现了最高的分类性能。在不确定性量化方面，集成方法在准确性和不确定性处理之间提供了良好的平衡，而EMCD对不确定预测更为敏感。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了将不确定性量化整合到基于深度学习的医疗诊断中的重要性，以提高实际临床应用中的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a weakly supervised multimodal framework for generating structured SOAP notes for skin carcinoma patients using lesion images and sparse clinical text, reducing clinician workload while achieving performance comparable to advanced models like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the labor-intensive process of manually generating detailed SOAP notes by physicians, which contributes to clinician burnout.

Method: A weakly supervised multimodal framework is proposed that generates clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs such as lesion images and sparse clinical text, with reduced reliance on manual annotations.

Result: The method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, Claude, DeepSeek Janus Pro) in terms of key clinical relevance metrics. Two novel metrics, MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS), were introduced to evaluate clinical quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables scalable, clinically grounded documentation with less need for large annotated datasets, potentially reducing clinician burden.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study explores the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to analyze students' academic emotions from facial expressions in online learning environments, revealing moderate performance with potential for practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional supervised machine learning approaches in analyzing students' academic emotions, which often require repeated data collection and training cycles, this research investigates the potential of VLMs in recognizing emotions through zero-shot prompting.

Method: Two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, were used to analyze 5,000 images showing various academic emotions using zero-shot prompting without fine-tuning.

Result: Both models showed moderate success in recognizing academic emotions, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct performing better than Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. They were particularly effective at identifying happiness but struggled with detecting distraction. Qwen2.5 also demonstrated strong ability in recognizing confusion.

Conclusion: VLMs have potential for analyzing students' academic emotions via facial expressions in online learning contexts, though challenges remain in accurately detecting certain emotions.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due to various factors, and understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may evolve in the future. Conventional approaches are difficult to standardize across different contexts.

Method: Propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, construct UrbanDiffBench dataset containing architectural images from different periods and regions, and develop UrbanSense framework for urban streetscape analysis.

Result: Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05). High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences.

Conclusion: The method has the potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for

TL;DR: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. However, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models. This work introduces Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unified models often underperform compared to specialized models due to the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality.

Method: Pisces is an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model with a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation.

Result: Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation when evaluated on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding and GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation.

Conclusion: The synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation is revealed, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders are demonstrated, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal

### [198] [Starting Positions Matter: A Study on Better Weight Initialization for Neural Network Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10463)
*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper conducts an in-depth study on the impact of different weight initializations on quantization robustness of trained models and proposes a new method called GHN-QAT which can predict parameters for quantized DNNs using Graph Hypernetworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research has focused on various techniques to boost the accuracy and robustness of DNNs during quantization, but little work has been done on improving the initial conditions of DNN training specifically for quantization. This paper aims to explore how different weight initialization methods affect the quantization robustness of trained models.

Method: The authors first examine the effects of different weight initializations on various CNN building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. They then introduce GHN-QAT, a method that uses Graph Hypernetworks to predict parameters for quantized DNNs. They also fine-tune these hypernetworks to better predict parameters for quantized graphs.

Result: The analysis shows that the choice of random weight initializer significantly affects final quantization robustness across varying CNN architectures. The GHN-QAT method demonstrates significant accuracy improvements even for 4-bit quantization and provides better-than-random accuracy for 2-bit quantization.

Conclusion: This study is the first in-depth exploration of quantization-aware DNN weight initialization. The proposed GHN-QAT method offers a novel approach to designing quantized DNN models, and future work could further optimize this process by integrating GHN-QAT-initialized parameters into quantization-aware training.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PSLG-SAM的框架，将RRSIS任务分解为粗定位和精细分割两个阶段，有效减少了标注数据的需求并提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RRSIS方法依赖多模态融合骨干网络和语义分割头，但面临密集注释需求和复杂场景解释的挑战。

Method: PSLG-SAM框架将RRSIS任务分为两个阶段：粗略定位阶段使用视觉基础网络定位文本描述的对象；精细分割阶段利用第一阶段的坐标引导Segment Anything Model (SAM)，并通过基于聚类的前景点生成器和掩码边界迭代优化策略实现精确分割。第二阶段可以无需训练，从而显著减少RRSIS任务的标注数据负担。此外，任务分解有助于专注于特定区域的分割，避免复杂场景的干扰。

Result: 在RRSIS-D和RRSIS-M两个数据集上的实验验证表明，PSLG-SAM实现了显著的性能提升，并超越了现有的最先进模型。

Conclusion: PSLG-SAM框架通过减少标注需求和提高分割精度，为RRSIS任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。贡献了一个高质量、多类别的手动标注数据集，代码将公开发布。

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning (CogStream), a new task for models to identify relevant historical context in streaming videos, along with a densely annotated dataset and CogReasoner, a baseline model that uses visual stream compression and dialogue retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of streaming video reasoning which requires identifying relevant historical context while avoiding computational burden and distraction from irrelevant information.

Method: Introduced CogStream task, provided a densely annotated dataset with hierarchical question-answer pairs, and proposed CogReasoner, a baseline model using visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the CogReasoner model in tackling the CogStream task.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel task and effective baseline model for context-guided streaming video reasoning.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.
Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be
released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在微调大型语言模型方面表现出色，但在视觉语言模型中扩展这一成功受到限制。因此，需要一个既具有挑战性又明确可验证的视觉中心任务来训练视觉语言模型。

Method: 引入了ViCrit任务，该任务通过在人类编写的图像标题段落中注入微妙的合成视觉幻觉，训练视觉语言模型定位这些幻觉。具体方法是在200字的标题中注入单一的视觉描述错误，并要求模型根据图像和修改后的标题指出被污染的部分。

Result: 使用ViCrit任务训练的模型在各种视觉语言基准测试中表现出显著的提升，并且改进可以超越自然图像训练数据，扩展到抽象图像推理和视觉数学领域。此外，还引入了ViCrit-Bench诊断基准，用于系统评估不同图像领域和错误类型的感知误差。

Conclusion: 精细的幻觉批评是提高视觉语言模型视觉感知的有效且可推广的目标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing metrics in detecting subtle disparities in the tails of the score distribution in face recognition systems.

Method: CEI analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, enabling a focus on tail probabilities while considering overall distribution shapes. Experiments were conducted on state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets.

Result: CEI and CEI^A demonstrate superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods fall short.

Conclusion: CEI provides a robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment and can be applied to comparing statistical distributions in other problems involving distribution tails.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

TL;DR: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos is crucial. Existing frameworks either lose human or product identity or lack understanding of spatial relationships.

Motivation: Existing methods fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions.

Method: Proposes a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that injects paired human-product reference information with an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. Uses 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes for motion guidance and structured text encoding for category-level semantics.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

Conclusion: The proposed DiT-based framework effectively addresses the challenges in generating high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos by preserving identities and improving realism.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

Motivation: Existing text-to-texture synthesis approaches have limitations such as gradual shift in texture properties across viewpoints, insufficient integration of previously synthesized textures and predefined camera positions not accounting for the object's geometry.

Method: TexTailor addresses these issues by applying a resampling scheme to repeatedly integrate information from previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process, fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on these resampled textures and using an performance preservation loss. It also adaptively adjusts camera positions based on the object's geometry.

Result: Experiments on a subset of the Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

Conclusion: TexTailor is a novel method that improves the consistency of synthesized textures across different viewpoints by addressing limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

### [206] [Symmetrical Flow Matching: Unified Image Generation, Segmentation, and Classification with Score-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10634)
*Francisco Caetano,Christiaan Viviers,Peter H. N. De With,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow) is introduced, unifying semantic segmentation, classification and image generation within a single model. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, competitive results on segmentation and promising capabilities in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for learning continuous transformations between distributions often lack bi-directional consistency or impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images. There is a need for a method that can jointly model forward and reverse transformations while preserving semantic information and generative diversity.

Method: SymmFlow uses a symmetric learning objective to model forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency and preserving entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective retains semantic information across flows, enabling efficient sampling and preserving semantic structure. This allows for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement and supports flexible conditioning with both pixel-level and image-level class labels.

Result: SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis with FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff using only 25 inference steps. It also delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks.

Conclusion: Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow) successfully unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model, achieving excellent performance in semantic image synthesis, segmentation, and classification tasks.

Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous
transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative
modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new
formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image
generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective,
SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

*Marzieh Oghbaie,Teresa Araújoa,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT is a patch-based interpretable prototypical model for image recognition, which leverages vision transformers and contrastive learning to deliver robust prototypes that align with clinical biomarkers. It performs competitively in retinal OCT image classification while offering meaningful explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prototype-based methods, although improving interpretability by learning fine-grained part-prototypes, face challenges in providing visualizations consistent with human-understandable biomarkers, especially in medical imaging where both presence and extent of biomarkers are crucial.

Method: The PiPViT model uses a vision transformer (ViT) to capture long-range dependencies among patches, enabling the learning of robust, human-interpretable prototypes that approximate lesion extent using only image-level labels. It also incorporates contrastive learning and multi-resolution input processing for effective localization of biomarkers across scales.

Result: PiPViT was evaluated on retinal OCT image classification across four datasets, achieving competitive quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while providing more meaningful explanations. The learned prototypes were confirmed to be semantically and clinically relevant through quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set.

Conclusion: PiPViT can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes, making it a valuable tool in medical imaging.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm using hyperbolic space for handling both instance and class recognition simultaneously. It proposes continual hierarchical metrics and validates the approach on EgoObjects dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning has been separately focused on instances or classes but real-world applications need models to handle both simultaneously. Thus, there's a need for an algorithm that can adapt to multiple levels of granularity over time.

Method: Propose HyperCLIC which leverages hyperbolic space for modeling hierarchical relationships between classes and instances. Incorporates hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives for continual embedding of hierarchical relations.

Result: Empirical results on EgoObjects dataset show effective operation at multiple granularities with improved hierarchical generalization.

Conclusion: HyperCLIC successfully addresses the task of continual learning of instances and classes by utilizing hyperbolic space and demonstrates strong performance in hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

*Emílio Dolgener Cantú,Rolf Klemens Wittmann,Oliver Abdeen,Patrick Wagner,Wojciech Samek,Moritz Baier,Sebastian Lapuschkin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a methodology using Deep Neural Networks to generate synthetic golden standards for Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project wafer manufacturing, enabling efficient defect detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template matching with known golden standards. However, for InP multi-project wafer manufacturing, these standards are typically unavailable due to low production scale and high design variability, resulting in manual and labor-intensive defect detection.

Method: The authors propose a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural Networks trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data. They evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs.

Result: The deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach, allowing for the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection.

Conclusion: This methodology can be applied to a template matching procedure, demonstrating its practical utility in surface defect detection for InP wafers.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural

*Laziz U. Abdullaev,Maksim Tkachenko,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper develops a unifying image processing framework to interpret self-attention mechanisms in transformers, including components like positional encoding and residual connections. It introduces two architectural modifications that enhance interpretability, accuracy, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a robust theoretical foundation for understanding the success and limitations of self-attention mechanisms in transformers, addressing gaps in current frameworks.

Method: Develop a unifying image processing framework to explain self-attention computation and related components (e.g., positional encoding, residual connections). Introduce two independent architectural modifications within transformers inspired by image processing.

Result: Empirical results show improved accuracy and robustness against data contamination and adversaries in language and vision tasks, as well as better long sequence understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances interpretability of self-attention mechanisms and demonstrates practical improvements in transformer performance.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

*Wenhao Guo,Peng Lu,Xujun Peng,Zhaoran Zhao,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), a unified model for ultra-large upsampling tasks in image super-resolution, which significantly outperforms existing methods in tasks like ×100.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ASISR methods suffer from performance decline and blurring when the upsampling factor exceeds the training data range.

Method: The SbCA model uses a stroke vector amplifier to decompose images into vector graphics for magnification, and a detail completion module to restore missing details. A cyclic strategy is employed for iterative refinement of details.

Result: The approach addresses distribution drift and eliminates artifacts, noise, and blurring, producing high-quality, high-resolution images. It outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets in ultra-large upsampling tasks.

Conclusion: SbCA effectively handles ultra-large upsampling tasks, delivering superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

*Guowei Zhong,Ruohong Huan,Mingzhen Wu,Ronghua Liang,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CIDer, a novel robust MER framework that addresses modality missing and OOD data challenges with fewer parameters and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) faces challenges in handling both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce excessive parameters, which limits their practicality.

Method: CIDer integrates MSSD and MACI modules. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through weight-sharing self-distillation approach across low-level features, attention maps, and high-level representations. WSAM reduces computational complexity while MCT facilitates efficient multimodal fusion. MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate label and language biases using MCM and fine-grained counterfactual texts.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CIDer is a novel robust MER framework that effectively addresses modality missing and OOD data challenges with fewer parameters and faster training.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

TL;DR: To tackle the challenges in understanding dynamics through visual observation, SlotPi integrates physical knowledge into an object-centric reasoning model, demonstrating strong adaptability and performance across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object-centric dynamic simulation methods emulate human behavior but lack integration of physical knowledge and validation of model adaptability across diverse scenarios.

Method: SlotPi is a slot-based physics-informed object-centric reasoning model that integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.

Result: SlotPi shows robust performance in tasks like prediction and Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets, as well as a newly created real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid dynamics, and fluid-object interactions.

Conclusion: SlotPi's strong adaptability lays a foundation for developing more advanced world models.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Conclusion: The findings indicate the potential of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in long video understanding problems.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity

challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial

TL;DR: Video matting is important for various applications, but deploying its models on resource-constrained devices is challenging. This paper proposes a novel PTQ framework for video matting models, which includes a two-stage PTQ strategy, a GAC method, and an OFA component. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different bit-widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenges of deploying computationally intensive video matting models on resource-constrained devices by using quantization techniques, specifically focusing on improving Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) for video matting tasks.

Method: The method involves proposing a novel two-stage PTQ strategy that combines block-reconstruction-based optimization and global calibration of quantization parameters. Additionally, a Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method is introduced to compensate for statistical distortions, and an Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component is used to leverage temporal and semantic priors from frames.

Result: The results show that the proposed PTQ4VM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different bit-widths compared to existing quantization methods. Notably, the 4-bit PTQ4VM achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart while reducing FLOPs by 8 times.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper presents a novel and general PTQ framework for video matting models, marking the first systematic attempt in this domain. The proposed methods effectively maintain accuracy and temporal coherence, achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VRBench, a new benchmark for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning abilities using long narrative videos. It includes 1,010 videos and provides a collaborative framework to generate reasoning chains. The authors also propose a new scoring metric and conduct extensive evaluations on various models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for large models do not adequately address temporal reasoning and procedural validity in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Method: VRBench is created with 1,010 long videos, 9,468 question-answering pairs, and 30,292 reasoning steps. A human-AI collaborative framework generates reasoning chains spanning seven types. A multi-phase evaluation pipeline assesses models comprehensively.

Result: Extensive evaluations were conducted on 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs, providing valuable insights into multi-step reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: VRBench addresses limitations in current evaluations and advances the field of multi-step reasoning by offering a comprehensive benchmark and evaluation pipeline.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples from the target domain. The proposed Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) approach achieves SOTA performance in 26 experiment setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the limitation of existing ZSGM methods where the learning objective assumes complete alignment between image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality degrade in generated images.

Method: The authors perform an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets. They propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR), which is the first ZSGM approach focusing on improving target domain image quality based on their new insight on offset misalignment.

Result: Qualitative, quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance.

Conclusion: This work highlights the issue of offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space and proposes AIR as a solution to improve target domain image quality in ZSGM.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image

TL;DR: The paper presents M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation that reduces computational costs and enhances video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video generation has great potential but is computationally demanding due to the vast spatiotemporal space. Existing solutions like Transformers have high complexity and alternatives like Mamba have limitations in multi-modal and spatiotemporal tasks.

Method: Introduced M4V with a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block for integrating multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling, reducing FLOPs by 45%. Also applied a reward learning strategy to improve visual quality in long-context generation.

Result: Experiments on text-to-video benchmarks show M4V's capability to produce high-quality videos with significantly lower computational costs compared to attention-based alternatives.

Conclusion: M4V successfully addresses challenges in text-to-video generation by lowering computational demands and enhancing visual quality; code and models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法依赖特定任务管道和专家模型生成训练数据，过程复杂且耗时。

Method: 引入可扩展方法将视频标注为交错的多模态序列，设计块因果扩散变压器以三个代理任务进行训练，并提出新型多轮图像编辑基准。

Result: 模型展现出强大的上下文图像编辑能力，在两个多轮图像编辑基准上达到最先进水平，并在多概念组合、故事生成等应用中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该模型无需专门训练数据即可直接从视频学习，具备广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

*Yuanhui Huang,Weiliang Chen,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An autoregressive visual generation framework named SpectralAR is proposed, which transforms images into ordered spectral tokens for coarse-to-fine generation, achieving sequence causality and token efficiency. Experiments show that SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive visual generation has advantages in scalability and compatibility compared to diffusion models, but existing methods using image patches contradict the causal nature of autoregressive modeling.

Method: The SpectralAR framework transforms images into ordered spectral tokens representing different frequency components through Nested Spectral Tokenization, then performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Result: SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID on ImageNet-1K with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in image reconstruction and autoregressive generation.

Conclusion: SpectralAR addresses the contradiction between image patches and autoregressive causality by using spectral tokens, achieving both sequence causality and token efficiency.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

### [221] [Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967)
*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), visual tokens are often longer than text tokens, increasing inference costs. Current pruning methods either retain duplicates or ignore instruction relevance. This paper introduces CDPruner, a training-free and model-agnostic method that maximizes conditional diversity of visual tokens using determinantal point process (DPP). Experiments show it sets new benchmarks in vision-language tasks, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high inference cost in MLLMs due to the length of visual tokens being greater than text tokens. Current pruning methods have limitations: attention-based pruning retains numerous duplicate tokens, and similarity-based pruning overlooks instruction relevance, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: The method proposed is CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained visual tokens. It defines conditional similarity between visual tokens based on the instruction and reformulates the token pruning problem with DPP to select a subset that better represents input images while adhering to user instructions.

Result: CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art results on various vision-language benchmarks across diverse MLLMs. When applied to LLaVA, it reduces FLOPs by 95% and CUDA latency by 78%, while maintaining 94% of the original accuracy.

Conclusion: CDPruner is an effective, training-free, and model-agnostic solution for visual token pruning in MLLMs. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, it significantly reduces computational cost while preserving strong performance.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper explores generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models through computational methods, examining effects of quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving on topological properties. It reveals destruction of edge states by strong localization, the non-Hermitian skin effect, and engineering of a Floquet topological insulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the behavior of SSH models under complex conditions such as quasi-periodic disorder, non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving to uncover novel phenomena in 1D topological systems.

Method: Employ exact diagonalization and numerical solvers to map phase space via spectral properties and localization characteristics using IPR. Use PCA for unsupervised classification of phases. Study effects of AAH modulation, non-Hermiticity, and Floquet driving.

Result: Standard SSH model's edge states are destroyed by strong AAH modulation-induced localization. Non-Hermiticity leads to skin effect with all bulk states localized at one boundary. Floquet driving can turn a trivial chain into a topological insulator with anomalous edge states.

Conclusion: Generalized SSH models exhibit rich behaviors including localization transitions, obscured topological signatures, non-Hermitian skin effect, and engineered Floquet topological phases.

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model serves as a canonical example of a
one-dimensional topological insulator, yet its behavior under more complex,
realistic conditions remains a fertile ground for research. This paper presents
a comprehensive computational investigation into generalized SSH models,
exploring the interplay between topology, quasi-periodic disorder,
non-Hermiticity, and time-dependent driving. Using exact diagonalization and
specialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its
spectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse
Participation Ratio (IPR). We demonstrate that while the standard SSH model
exhibits topologically protected edge states, these are destroyed by a
localization transition induced by strong Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH)
modulation. Further, we employ unsupervised machine learning (PCA) to
autonomously classify the system's phases, revealing that strong localization
can obscure underlying topological signatures. Extending the model beyond
Hermiticity, we uncover the non-Hermitian skin effect, a dramatic localization
of all bulk states at a boundary. Finally, we apply a periodic Floquet drive to
a topologically trivial chain, successfully engineering a Floquet topological
insulator characterized by the emergence of anomalous edge states at the
boundaries of the quasi-energy zone. These findings collectively provide a
multi-faceted view of the rich phenomena hosted in generalized 1D topological
systems.

Motivation: To understand and control the atomistic-level reactions governing the formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in next-generation solid state batteries.

Method: Large-scale explicit reactive simulations with quantum accuracy using active learning and deep equivariant neural network interatomic potentials. Unsupervised classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic environments are used to characterize reactions and interdiffusion at the interface.

Result: Discovery of a previously unreported crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the SEI. Simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms.

Conclusion: The approach creates a digital twin from first principles, providing insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling the atomistic-level reactions governing the
formation of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for the
viability of next-generation solid state batteries. However, challenges persist
due to difficulties in experimentally characterizing buried interfaces and
limits in simulation speed and accuracy. We conduct large-scale explicit
reactive simulations with quantum accuracy for a symmetric battery cell,
{\symcell}, enabled by active learning and deep equivariant neural network
interatomic potentials. To automatically characterize the coupled reactions and
interdiffusion at the interface, we formulate and use unsupervised
classification techniques based on clustering in the space of local atomic
environments. Our analysis reveals the formation of a previously unreported
crystalline disordered phase, Li$_2$S$_{0.72}$P$_{0.14}$Cl$_{0.14}$, in the
SEI, that evaded previous predictions based purely on thermodynamics,
underscoring the importance of explicit modeling of full reaction and transport
kinetics. Our simulations agree with and explain experimental observations of
the SEI formations and elucidate the Li creep mechanisms, critical to dendrite
initiation, characterized by significant Li motion along the interface. Our
approach is to crease a digital twin from first principles, without adjustable
parameters fitted to experiment. As such, it offers capabilities to gain
insights into atomistic dynamics governing complex heterogeneous processes in
solid-state synthesis and electrochemistry.

Motivation: 全球海洋生态系统模型的spin-up过程需要大量计算资源和时间，因此研究者希望找到一种更高效的方法来生成接近稳定状态的初始值，从而减少spin-up所需的迭代次数和计算成本。

Method: 利用预计算的稳定状态数据作为训练集，采用条件变分自动编码器（CVAE）结合质量校正技术，构建从少量生物地球化学模型参数到三维稳定年度周期的映射关系。然后将CVAE预测结果用作spin-up的初始值，评估其对迭代次数和计算时间的影响，并与使用训练数据均值作为初始值的效果进行比较。

Result: 1. CVAE预测的稳定状态与传统spin-up结果具有合理的一致性，但在年度周期性方面略逊一筹。
2. 使用CVAE预测作为初始值，spin-up所需的迭代次数（对应模型年份）可减少50%-95%，具体取决于停止准则。
3. 相比之下，使用训练数据均值作为初始值虽也能加速spin-up，但效果远低于CVAE方法。

Conclusion: CVAE结合质量校正是一种有效生成接近稳定状态初始值的方法，能够显著减少spin-up所需的计算时间和迭代次数，为大规模海洋生态系统模拟提供了潜在的效率提升途径。

Abstract: We used precomputed steady states obtained by a spin-up for a global marine
ecosystem model as training data to build a mapping from the small number of
biogeochemical model parameters onto the three-dimensional converged steady
annual cycle. The mapping was performed by a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) with mass correction. Applied for test data, we show that
the prediction obtained by the CVAE already gives a reasonable good
approximation of the steady states obtained by a regular spin-up. However, the
predictions do not reach the same level of annual periodicity as those obtained
in the original spin-up data. Thus, we took the predictions as initial values
for a spin-up. We could show that the number of necessary iterations,
corresponding to model years, to reach a prescribed stopping criterion in the
spin-up could be significantly reduced compared to the use of the originally
uniform, constant initial value. The amount of reduction depends on the applied
stopping criterion, measuring the periodicity of the solution. The savings in
needed iterations and, thus, computing time for the spin-up ranges from 50 to
95\%, depending on the stopping criterion for the spin-up. We compared these
results with the use of the mean of the training data as an initial value. We
found that this also accelerates the spin-up, but only by a much lower factor.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a combination of approaches to make adaptation to a single minute of data robust for speech recognisers, achieving a 20% relative improvement in word error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that data is usually unlabelled.

Method: First, instead of estimating the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional entropy over complete hypotheses. Second, a "speaker code" characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data to estimate.

Result: On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

Conclusion: The combination of approaches makes adaptation to a single minute of data robust for speech recognisers.

TL;DR: This study explores using a neuromorphic network, based on memristive elements, to learn and model dynamical systems by simulating it in a reservoir computing framework for autonomous prediction of multivariate chaotic time series. Results show that optimal nonlinear dynamical responses are achieved when input voltages maximize the dynamical range of memristive components, and increasing network coverage with input electrodes suppresses less conducive nonlinear responses.

Motivation: To investigate how dynamical systems can be learned and modeled using a neuromorphic network which itself is a dynamical system.

Method: The study utilized a neuromorphic network based on complex electrical circuits with memristive elements. The network was simulated within a reservoir computing framework to perform autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series. Optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were sought by manipulating input electrodes and voltages.

Result: Optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximized the number of memristive components exploring the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with input electrodes suppressed other nonlinear responses less conducive to learning.

Conclusion: These findings offer valuable insights into optimizing practical neuromorphic network devices for learning complex dynamical systems through external control parameters.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled

manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical
responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive
components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the
memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was
found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to
learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical
neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical
systems using only external control parameters.

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

TL;DR: The paper investigates the memory retrieval capabilities of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) with different hidden unit prior distributions, finding that modifications like local biases and richer priors can significantly improve recall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural choices and activation functions affect the thermodynamic properties of RBMs and their effectiveness as associative memories.

Method: Analyzing the phase diagram of bipartite energy-based neural networks (RBMs) with various hidden unit prior distributions, drawing connections to the Hopfield model and using tools from statistical physics.

Result: Standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes suffer from reduced critical capacity; modifications such as local biases and richer hidden unit priors restore ordered retrieval phases and improve recall performance.

Conclusion: Hidden unit design is crucial for enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram and memory retrieval capabilities of
bipartite energy-based neural networks, namely Restricted Boltzmann Machines
(RBMs), as a function of the prior distribution imposed on their hidden units -
including binary, multi-state, and ReLU-like activations. Drawing connections
to the Hopfield model and employing analytical tools from statistical physics
of disordered systems, we explore how the architectural choices and activation
functions shape the thermodynamic properties of these models. Our analysis
reveals that standard RBMs with binary hidden nodes and extensive connectivity
suffer from reduced critical capacity, limiting their effectiveness as
associative memories. To address this, we examine several modifications, such
as introducing local biases and adopting richer hidden unit priors. These
adjustments restore ordered retrieval phases and markedly improve recall
performance, even at finite temperatures. Our theoretical findings, supported
by finite-size Monte Carlo simulations, highlight the importance of hidden unit
design in enhancing the expressive power of RBMs.

### [232] [Patient-Specific Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Replanning in Head-and-Neck Cancer Proton Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10073)
*Malvern Madondo,Yuan Shao,Yingzi Liu,Jun Zhou,Xiaofeng Yang,Zhen Tian*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: Anatomical changes during IMPT for HNC can risk tumor underdosing and organ-at-risk overdosing, so treatment replanning is often needed. A patient-specific deep reinforcement learning framework for automated IMPT replanning is proposed to solve this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anatomical changes during IMPT for HNC can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and organ-at-risk overdosing. Current manual replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming.

Method: A patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is proposed with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a 150-point plan quality score. The planning process is formulated as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust optimization priorities. Two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization, were implemented using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state representations and a 22-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.

Result: Evaluation on five HNC patients showed both DRL agents improved initial plan scores significantly, surpassing manual replans generated by a human planner. Clinical validation confirms that improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse anatomical changes.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of DRL in addressing geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton therapy.

Abstract: Anatomical changes during intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for
head-and-neck cancer (HNC) can shift Bragg peaks, risking tumor underdosing and
organ-at-risk overdosing. As a result, treatment replanning is often required
to maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual
replanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a
patient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT
replanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality
score addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning
process as an RL problem where agents learn control policies to adjust
optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike population-based
approaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using
their planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating
anatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific
approach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling
effective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network
and Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state
representations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.
Evaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL
agents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \pm
6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by
a human planner ($137.20 \pm 5.58$). Clinical validation confirms that
improvements translate to better tumor coverage and OAR sparing across diverse
anatomical changes. This work demonstrates DRL's potential in addressing
geometric and dosimetric complexities of adaptive proton therapy, offering
efficient offline adaptation solutions and advancing online adaptive proton
therapy.

high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive
experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this
context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing
challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language
into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic
platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions
without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our
previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class
of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a
diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests.
This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in
precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses challenges in embodied AI by requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate visually rich environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models have improved multimodal understanding but introduced computational cost and deployment issues.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable
autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids
this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded

prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and
lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings.
We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our

comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the
ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and
conditions.

TL;DR: This paper applies Gaussian Mixture Copula Models to driving scenarios for automated driving systems' safety validation, benchmarking it against other models using real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the safety validation of automated driving systems by effectively modeling the joint probability distribution of driving scenario parameters.

Method: Using Gaussian Mixture Copula Models which combine multimodal expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and flexibility of copulas, allowing separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies.

Result: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data compared to Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models in terms of likelihood and Sinkhorn distance, evaluated across 18 million scenario instances.

Conclusion: Gaussian Mixture Copula Models are a promising basis for future scenario-based validation frameworks for automated driving systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Gaussian Mixture Copula Models
to the statistical modeling of driving scenarios for the safety validation of
automated driving systems. Knowledge of the joint probability distribution of
scenario parameters is essential for scenario-based safety assessment, where
risk quantification depends on the likelihood of concrete parameter
combinations. Gaussian Mixture Copula Models bring together the multimodal
expressivity of Gaussian Mixture Models and the flexibility of copulas,
enabling separate modeling of marginal distributions and dependencies. We
benchmark Gaussian Mixture Copula Models against previously proposed approaches
- Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Copula Models - using real-world driving
data drawn from scenarios defined in United Nations Regulation No. 157. Our
evaluation across 18 million scenario instances demonstrates that Gaussian
Mixture Copula Models provide a better fit to the data in terms of both
likelihood and Sinkhorn distance. These results suggest that Gaussian Mixture
Copula Models are a compelling foundation for future scenario-based validation
frameworks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper shows how autonomous learning from real-world data can improve robotic picking performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of multi-suction robot picking in unstructured environments such as warehouses.

Method: Utilize multiple input modalities (RGB, depth, semantic segmentation) and a combination of multimodal pretrain and finetune to estimate the quality of candidate picks.

Result: The approach is comprehensively evaluated on large datasets, showing improvements in performance for different item configurations, pick scenes, and object types.

Conclusion: Ablation studies reveal the importance of training over multiple modalities and the ability of models to learn relationships between them.

Abstract: This work demonstrates how autonomously learning aspects of robotic operation
from sparsely-labeled, real-world data of deployed, engineered solutions at
industrial scale can provide with solutions that achieve improved performance.
Specifically, it focuses on multi-suction robot picking and performs a
comprehensive study on the application of multi-modal visual encoders for
predicting the success of candidate robotic picks. Picking diverse items from
unstructured piles is an important and challenging task for robot manipulation
in real-world settings, such as warehouses. Methods for picking from clutter
must work for an open set of items while simultaneously meeting latency
constraints to achieve high throughput. The demonstrated approach utilizes
multiple input modalities, such as RGB, depth and semantic segmentation, to
estimate the quality of candidate multi-suction picks. The strategy is trained
from real-world item picking data, with a combination of multimodal pretrain
and finetune. The manuscript provides comprehensive experimental evaluation
performed over a large item-picking dataset, an item-picking dataset targeted
to include partial occlusions, and a package-picking dataset, which focuses on
containers, such as boxes and envelopes, instead of unpackaged items. The
evaluation measures performance for different item configurations, pick scenes,
and object types. Ablations help to understand the effects of in-domain
pretraining, the impact of different modalities and the importance of
finetuning. These ablations reveal both the importance of training over
multiple modalities but also the ability of models to learn during pretraining
the relationship between modalities so that during finetuning and inference,
only a subset of them can be used as input.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework for UAVs to execute language-guided flight by integrating an instruction encoder, a goal retriever, and a waypoint planner. VLFly outputs continuous velocity commands from egocentric observations without localization or active ranging sensors, showing robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces in vision-and-language navigation (VLN).

Method: VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM) that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control.

Result: VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities.

Conclusion: VLFly provides a promising approach for UAVs to execute language-guided flight with strong generalization abilities and does not require localization or active ranging sensors.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in
autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human
instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain
in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance
on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose
Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for
localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity
commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular
camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a
large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into
structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM)
that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a
waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV
control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without
additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover,
real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and
indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary
goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the
presence of abstract language input.

Abstract: An alternative data-driven modeling approach has been proposed and employed
to gain fundamental insights into robot motion interaction with granular
terrain at certain length scales. The approach is based on an integration of
dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value
Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation
techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online

high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The
results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can
be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with
physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input,
the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have
comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse
physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its
embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only
high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is
demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the
scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum
resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a
case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and
exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline

TL;DR: The paper establishes sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices from noisy data, proves an algorithm's existence that outputs a simplex close to the true one given certain conditions, derives new information-theoretic lower bounds, and introduces a novel Fourier-based method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the sample complexity involved in learning high-dimensional simplices from noisy data, extending prior work and resolving an open question about the alignment of noisy-case complexity with the noiseless case when SNR is sufficiently high.

Method: Proves the existence of an algorithm that can output a simplex within a specified distance from the true simplex under certain conditions. Derives information-theoretic lower bounds for simplex estimation. Uses sample compression techniques and introduces a Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy observations.

Result: Demonstrates that with high probability, a simplex can be estimated accurately given sufficient samples. Shows that the derived lower bounds match known upper bounds in the noiseless scenario up to constant factors. Proves that noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case when SNR is sufficiently high.

Conclusion: The study provides sample complexity bounds for learning high-dimensional simplices from noisy data, introduces a novel Fourier-based method, and resolves an open question regarding the relationship between noisy and noiseless case complexities.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish sample complexity bounds for learning
high-dimensional simplices in $\mathbb{R}^K$ from noisy data. Specifically, we
consider $n$ i.i.d. samples uniformly drawn from an unknown simplex in
$\mathbb{R}^K$, each corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of unknown variance.
We prove an algorithm exists that, with high probability, outputs a simplex
within $\ell_2$ or total variation (TV) distance at most $\varepsilon$ from the
true simplex, provided $n \ge (K^2/\varepsilon^2)
e^{\mathcal{O}(K/\mathrm{SNR}^2)}$, where $\mathrm{SNR}$ is the signal-to-noise
ratio. Extending our prior work~\citep{saberi2023sample}, we derive new
information-theoretic lower bounds, showing that simplex estimation within TV
distance $\varepsilon$ requires at least $n \ge \Omega(K^3
\sigma^2/\varepsilon^2 + K/\varepsilon)$ samples, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the
noise variance. In the noiseless scenario, our lower bound $n \ge
\Omega(K/\varepsilon)$ matches known upper bounds up to constant factors. We
resolve an open question by demonstrating that when $\mathrm{SNR} \ge
\Omega(K^{1/2})$, noisy-case complexity aligns with the noiseless case. Our
analysis leverages sample compression techniques (Ashtiani et al., 2018) and
introduces a novel Fourier-based method for recovering distributions from noisy
observations, potentially applicable beyond simplex learning.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents Momentum Multi-Marginal Schrödinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM), a novel framework for inferring trajectories in complex systems, which learns smooth measure-valued splines satisfying multiple positional constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of current methodologies that rely on pairwise interpolation between adjacent snapshots, which hinders their ability to capture long-range temporal dependencies and affects the coherence of inferred trajectories.

Method: 3MSBM lifts dynamics to phase space, generalizes stochastic bridges conditioned on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal control problem. It minimizes a variational objective with the path induced by the multi-marginal conditional bridge fixed.

Result: Extensive experimentation shows 3MSBM outperforms existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies, improving convergence and scalability.

Conclusion: 3MSBM provides a superior approach for inferring trajectories in complex systems, opening new possibilities for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal settings.

Abstract: Understanding complex systems by inferring trajectories from sparse sample
snapshots is a fundamental challenge in a wide range of domains, e.g.,
single-cell biology, meteorology, and economics. Despite advancements in Bridge
and Flow matching frameworks, current methodologies rely on pairwise
interpolation between adjacent snapshots. This hinders their ability to capture
long-range temporal dependencies and potentially affects the coherence of the
inferred trajectories. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{Momentum
Multi-Marginal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (3MSBM)}, a novel matching
framework that learns smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that
satisfy multiple positional constraints. This is achieved by lifting the
dynamics to phase space and generalizing stochastic bridges to be conditioned
on several points, forming a multi-marginal conditional stochastic optimal
control problem. The underlying dynamics are then learned by minimizing a
variational objective, having fixed the path induced by the multi-marginal
conditional bridge. As a matching approach, 3MSBM learns transport maps that
preserve intermediate marginals throughout training, significantly improving
convergence and scalability. Extensive experimentation in a series of
real-world applications validates the superior performance of 3MSBM compared to
existing methods in capturing complex dynamics with temporal dependencies,
opening new avenues for training matching frameworks in multi-marginal
settings.

It characterizes learnable distribution classes against oblivious and adaptive adversaries, offering insights into function class and adversary constraints enabling learnability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between adversarial and stochastic settings in online learning, providing a more general understanding beyond smoothed analysis.

Method: Using the framework of distributionally constrained adversaries where instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some constrained distribution class.

Result: Characterization for learnable distribution classes is provided against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, recovering and generalizing known smoothed settings. Learning can be achieved without prior knowledge of the distribution class for several natural function classes.

Conclusion: The framework offers insights into the interplay between function classes and adversary constraints enabling learnability, showing that learning can occur without prior knowledge of the distribution class.

Abstract: There has been much recent interest in understanding the continuum from
adversarial to stochastic settings in online learning, with various frameworks
including smoothed settings proposed to bridge this gap. We consider the more
general and flexible framework of distributionally constrained adversaries in
which instances are drawn from distributions chosen by an adversary within some
constrained distribution class [RST11]. Compared to smoothed analysis, we
consider general distributional classes which allows for a fine-grained
understanding of learning settings between fully stochastic and fully
adversarial for which a learner can achieve non-trivial regret. We give a
characterization for which distribution classes are learnable in this context
against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries, providing insights into the
types of interplay between the function class and distributional constraints on
adversaries that enable learnability. In particular, our results recover and
generalize learnability for known smoothed settings. Further, we show that for
several natural function classes including linear classifiers, learning can be
achieved without any prior knowledge of the distribution class -- in other
words, a learner can simultaneously compete against any constrained adversary
within learnable distribution classes.

Abstract: It is well known that semantic and structural features of the generated
images emerge at different times during the reverse dynamics of diffusion, a
phenomenon that has been connected to physical phase transitions in magnets and
other materials. In this paper, we introduce a general information-theoretic
approach to measure when these class-semantic "decisions" are made during the
generative process. By using an online formula for the optimal Bayesian
classifier, we estimate the conditional entropy of the class label given the
noisy state. We then determine the time intervals corresponding to the highest
information transfer between noisy states and class labels using the time
derivative of the conditional entropy. We demonstrate our method on
one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and on DDPM models trained on the
CIFAR10 dataset. As expected, we find that the semantic information transfer is
highest in the intermediate stages of diffusion while vanishing during the
final stages. However, we found sizable differences between the entropy rate
profiles of different classes, suggesting that different "semantic decisions"
are located at different intermediate times.

*Kyohei Atarashi,Satoshi Oyama,Hiromi Arai,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces box-constrained softmax (BCSoftmax) to enforce hard constraints on output probabilities and proposes two post-hoc calibration methods based on BCSoftmax for mitigating underconfidence and overconfidence in models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax function provides soft control via its temperature parameter but lacks the ability to enforce hard constraints such as box constraints on output probabilities which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and trustworthy models.

Method: Propose BCSoftmax function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on output probabilities.Formulate BCSoftmax as the solution to a box-constrained optimization problem.Develop an exact and efficient computation algorithm for BCSoftmax.Introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on BCSoftmax.

Result: Experimentally demonstrate effectiveness of the methods using TinyImageNet CIFAR-100 and 20NewsGroups datasets achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

Conclusion: BCSoftmax and the proposed post-hoc calibration methods enhance reliability in downstream decision-making tasks.

Abstract: Controlling the output probabilities of softmax-based models is a common
problem in modern machine learning. Although the $\mathrm{Softmax}$ function
provides soft control via its temperature parameter, it lacks the ability to
enforce hard constraints, such as box constraints, on output probabilities,
which can be critical in certain applications requiring reliable and
trustworthy models. In this work, we propose the box-constrained softmax
($\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$) function, a novel generalization of the
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ function that explicitly enforces lower and upper bounds on
output probabilities. While $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$ is formulated as the solution
to a box-constrained optimization problem, we develop an exact and efficient
computation algorithm for $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. As a key application, we
introduce two post-hoc calibration methods based on $\mathrm{BCSoftmax}$. The
proposed methods mitigate underconfidence and overconfidence in predictive
models by learning the lower and upper bounds of the output probabilities or
logits after model training, thereby enhancing reliability in downstream
decision-making tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods
experimentally using the TinyImageNet, CIFAR-100, and 20NewsGroups datasets,
achieving improvements in calibration metrics.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自适应离线学习方法，通过迭代改进策略并重新部署以收集更高质量的数据，提出了一种基于PAC-Bayesian理论的Logarithmic Smoothing估计器调整方法，该方法在静态环境下与顶级离线方法性能相当，在允许中间策略部署时显著优于它们。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线学习通常依赖于静态行为策略下的记录交互数据，但这种方法可能无法充分利用数据潜力。为了提高数据质量和学习效率，研究者们开始关注自适应离线学习，其中策略可以迭代改进和重新部署。

Method: 基于在线PAC-Bayesian理论，扩展了静态环境下的PAC-Bayesian学习与Logarithmic Smoothing方法到自适应场景，并对LS估计器进行了原则性调整以适应多轮部署。

Result: 该方法在静态环境下表现与顶级离线方法相当，而在允许中间策略部署的情况下显著优于现有方法。实证评估表明，自适应数据收集和PAC-Bayesian公式具有明显优势。

Conclusion: 自适应离线学习方法结合PAC-Bayesian框架能够有效提升策略优化效果，尤其在动态数据收集场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Off-policy learning serves as the primary framework for learning optimal
policies from logged interactions collected under a static behavior policy. In
this work, we investigate the more practical and flexible setting of adaptive
off-policy learning, where policies are iteratively refined and re-deployed to
collect higher-quality data. Building on the success of PAC-Bayesian learning
with Logarithmic Smoothing (LS) in static settings, we extend this framework to
the adaptive scenario using tools from online PAC-Bayesian theory. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that a principled adjustment to the LS estimator naturally
accommodates multiple rounds of deployment and yields faster convergence rates
under mild conditions. Our method matches the performance of leading offline
approaches in static settings, and significantly outperforms them when
intermediate policy deployments are allowed. Empirical evaluations across
diverse scenarios highlight both the advantages of adaptive data collection and
the strength of the PAC-Bayesian formulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the commonly used difference-in-means estimator in A/B testing for better evaluation of potential improvements achieved by a new decision system compared to a baseline.

Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating
the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a
baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each
exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the
difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the
commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved.
We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower
variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the
estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and

*Dimitri Meunier,Antoine Moulin,Jakub Wornbard,Vladimir R. Kostic,Arthur Gretton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper addresses causal effect estimation with hidden confounders using nonparametric IV regression, proposing a generalization error bound for spectral features and identifying three key scenarios affecting method performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden confounders is challenging. Nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression offers a promising approach but requires further investigation into its performance characteristics and failure modes.

Method: The authors derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator based on spectral features. They analyze the performance of this method under different conditions defined by spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay of the operator linking treatments to instruments.

Result: Performance depends on two key factors: spectral alignment and eigenvalue decay. The good scenario occurs with strong spectral alignment and slow eigenvalue decay. The bad scenario involves strong spectral alignment but rapid eigenvalue decay, requiring more samples. The ugly scenario happens when there is weak spectral alignment leading to method failure.

Conclusion: The paper provides insights into the performance and limitations of nonparametric IV regression using spectral features, categorizing outcomes into good, bad, and ugly scenarios.

Abstract: We address the problem of causal effect estimation in the presence of hidden
confounders, using nonparametric instrumental variable (IV) regression. A
leading strategy employs spectral features - that is, learned features spanning
the top eigensubspaces of the operator linking treatments to instruments. We
derive a generalization error bound for a two-stage least squares estimator
based on spectral features, and gain insights into the method's performance and
failure modes. We show that performance depends on two key factors, leading to
a clear taxonomy of outcomes. In a good scenario, the approach is optimal. This
occurs with strong spectral alignment, meaning the structural function is
well-represented by the top eigenfunctions of the conditional operator, coupled
with this operator's slow eigenvalue decay, indicating a strong instrument.
Performance degrades in a bad scenario: spectral alignment remains strong, but
rapid eigenvalue decay (indicating a weaker instrument) demands significantly
more samples for effective feature learning. Finally, in the ugly scenario,
weak spectral alignment causes the method to fail, regardless of the
eigenvalues' characteristics. Our synthetic experiments empirically validate
this taxonomy.

Result: Enables rigorous yet efficient dataset curation using modern AI models, demonstrated through text annotation, image labeling, and protein folding analysis.

Conclusion: This approach can significantly reduce the cost of obtaining high-quality labeled datasets while maintaining a low overall labeling error.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labeled datasets is often costly, requiring either
extensive human annotation or expensive experiments. We propose a method that
supplements such "expert" labels with AI predictions from pre-trained models to
construct labeled datasets more cost-effectively. Our approach results in
probably approximately correct labels: with high probability, the overall
labeling error is small. This solution enables rigorous yet efficient dataset
curation using modern AI models. We demonstrate the benefits of the methodology
through text annotation with large language models, image labeling with
pre-trained vision models, and protein folding analysis with AlphaFold.

### [250] [What Exactly Does Guidance Do in Masked Discrete Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10971)
*He Ye,Rojas Kevin,Tao Molei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion models with classifier-free guidance
(CFG). Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit
solution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the
sampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data
distribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a
specific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses
regions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength
$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.
Notably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We
also show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation
($\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for
both $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in
shaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the
sampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that
illustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence.

Motivation: To advance understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data by providing a comprehensive benchmark.

Method: Evaluation of 19 SSL methods across 9 datasets focusing on batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality prediction tasks with systematic assessment of various data augmentation strategies.

Result: Specialized frameworks like scVI excel at uni-modal batch correction while generic SSL methods perform better in cell typing and multi-modal data integration. Random masking is the most effective augmentation technique.

Conclusion: scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform with recommendations for SSL application in single-cell analysis, promoting deep learning and single-cell genomics convergence.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven to be a powerful approach for
extracting biologically meaningful representations from single-cell data. To
advance our understanding of SSL methods applied to single-cell data, we
present scSSL-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates nineteen SSL
methods. Our evaluation spans nine datasets and focuses on three common
downstream tasks: batch correction, cell type annotation, and missing modality
prediction. Furthermore, we systematically assess various data augmentation
strategies. Our analysis reveals task-specific trade-offs: the specialized
single-cell frameworks, scVI, CLAIRE, and the finetuned scGPT excel at
uni-modal batch correction, while generic SSL methods, such as VICReg and
SimCLR, demonstrate superior performance in cell typing and multi-modal data
integration. Random masking emerges as the most effective augmentation
technique across all tasks, surpassing domain-specific augmentations. Notably,
our results indicate the need for a specialized single-cell multi-modal data
integration framework. scSSL-Bench provides a standardized evaluation platform
and concrete recommendations for applying SSL to single-cell analysis,
advancing the convergence of deep learning and single-cell genomics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nullsettes, a set of prediction tasks to evaluate genomic language models' (gLMs) ability to predict loss-of-function mutations in synthetic expression cassettes. It finds that mutation effect prediction performance correlates with nonmutant likelihood and depends on sequence length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the ability of gLMs to predict loss-of-function mutations created by translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes.

Method: Introduced Nullsettes, a set of prediction tasks, and evaluated 12 state-of-the-art models on their mutation effect prediction performance.

Result: Mutation effect prediction performance strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant, and model performance is highly dependent on sequence length.

Conclusion: It is important to consider both sequence likelihood and sequence length when using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

Abstract: Genomic language models (gLMs) show potential for generating novel,
functional DNA sequences for synthetic biology, but doing so requires them to
learn not just evolutionary plausibility, but also sequence-to-function
relationships. We introduce a set of prediction tasks called Nullsettes, which
assesses a model's ability to predict loss-of-function mutations created by
translocating key control elements in synthetic expression cassettes. Across 12
state-of-the-art models, we find that mutation effect prediction performance
strongly correlates with the predicted likelihood of the nonmutant.
Furthermore, the range of likelihood values predictive of strong model
performance is highly dependent on sequence length. Our work highlights the
importance of considering both sequence likelihood and sequence length when
using gLMs for mutation effect prediction.

TL;DR: An efficient algorithm is designed to output a linear classifier for identifying homogeneous subsets from large datasets, using a rounding technique that approximates the optimal solution within a factor of 0.82.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design an efficient algorithm that can identify homogeneous subsets (subcohorts) from large inhomogeneous datasets, specifically focusing on patient data. The aim is to find subcohorts where significant changes in methylation levels co-occur with nuclear receptor expression, which can be useful for disease pathway discovery and therapeutics.

Method: The researchers developed a rounding technique inspired by Goemans and Williamson (1994), which approximates the optimal solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of 0.82. They then applied this algorithm to the breast cancer RNA microarray dataset by Curtis et al. (2012) to identify homogeneous subcohorts of patients mainly comprised of metastatic cases.

Result: The algorithm successfully identified homogeneous subcohorts of patients mainly comprised of metastatic cases from the breast cancer RNA microarray dataset. Additionally, it was able to systematically identify subcohorts where statistically significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur with significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.

Conclusion: Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can provide valuable insights into disease pathways and lead to the development of specific therapeutics for these subcohorts.

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs a linear classifier for
identifying homogeneous subsets (equivalently subcohorts) from large
inhomogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique,
similar to that of Goemans and Williamson (1994), that approximates the optimal
solution of the underlying optimization problem within a factor of $0.82$. As
an application, we use our algorithm to design a simple test that can identify
homogeneous subcohorts of patients, that are mainly comprised of metastatic
cases, from the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer by Curtis et al.
(2012). Furthermore, we also use the test output by the algorithm to
systematically identify subcohorts of patients in which statistically
significant changes in methylation levels of tumor suppressor genes co-occur
with statistically significant changes in nuclear receptor expression.
Identifying such homogeneous subcohorts of patients can be useful for the
discovery of disease pathways and therapeutics, specific to the subcohort.

Motivation: To understand how AI can effectively enhance human creativity.

Method: Identify and analyze three primary modes of AI contribution to creative processes along two key dimensions: technical autonomy and perceived agency.

Result: Influence different levels of creativity from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting innovation through various configurations of AI-human interaction.

Conclusion: AI's role in boosting human creativity has theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human

how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of
distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can
contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy,
where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where
human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative
system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of
technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived
agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different
levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting
innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health,
life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such
as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly
integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences.
Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies
influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based
applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what
forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation
methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of
30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains
including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence,
collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight
the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective
technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical
concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the
potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls
for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation
strategies.

Conclusion: 所提出的DUN-SRE方法通过引入时空旋转等变性显著提高了动态MRI重建的质量，为广泛的动态MRI重建任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Motivation: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) segmentation in medical imaging typically requires large amounts of manually annotated data, which is costly and time-consuming. To address the scarcity of labeled data, semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are explored.

Method: SWDL-Net combines Laplacian pyramid for edge sharpening and deep convolutional upsampling for detail precision enhancement through flexible feature mapping. A difference learning mechanism effectively integrates these complementary approaches for better segmentation.

Result: SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks when only 2% of data is labeled. It also shows superiority on the Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data.

Conclusion: SWDL-Net demonstrates significant performance improvements in scenarios with limited labeled data, proving its effectiveness in volumetric medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been

performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific
models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with
regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy

### [260] [SNR and Resource Adaptive Deep JSCC for Distributed IoT Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10699)
*Ali Waqas,Sinem Coleri*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework with LAIGA for wireless image classification, improving accuracy in low SNR and limited computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational limitations and data transmission challenges over noisy channels. Existing methods lack adaptability to varying conditions.

Method: Proposes a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework using LAIGA to optimize network configuration under given constraints, discarding infeasible configurations and utilizing Random Forests based learning assistance.

Result: Outperforms fixed-split architectures and existing SNR-adaptive methods, achieving a 10% increase in classification accuracy compared to JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at low SNR and across various computational budgets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective in enhancing wireless image classification accuracy under low SNR and limited computational resources.

Abstract: Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational
limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for
server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network
(DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and
transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods
rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to
varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose
a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless
image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a
learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently
explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under
given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the
infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT
device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to
avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application
specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures
and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited
computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy
as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR
as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M
FLOPs) at IoT device.

*Seyed Moein Abtahi,Akramul Azim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study integrates LLMs into software development workflows for automated code issue detection and revision, using static analysis, RAG, and a custom app to reduce hallucinations. Results show significant improvements in code quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in automating code issue detection and revision within software development workflows, aiming to improve code quality and streamline the process.

Method: Using static code analysis to detect issues, extracting detailed information for LLM-driven revisions, applying iterative prompt engineering, implementing RAG for better precision, and using a custom 'Code Comparison App' to mitigate hallucinations.

Result: Significant reduction in code issues after subsequent scans, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with static code analysis and RAG can effectively improve code quality, make the software development process more efficient, and save time and resources.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and
GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework
detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a
large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted
and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative
prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to
produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance
and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time
external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates
plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code
Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before
applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis
framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code
quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and
resource expenditure.

### [263] [Prompt Variability Effects On LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10204)
*Andrei Paleyes,Radzim Sendyka,Diana Robinson,Christian Cabrera,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper focuses on the sensitivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation based on input quality, proposing a synthetic evaluation pipeline and a persona-based approach to assess LLM responses irrespective of programming tasks or specific LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the variability in code quality generated by LLMs, which depends heavily on the quality of prompts and the user's familiarity with software development. It aims to quantify LLM's sensitivity to input variations.

Method: The authors propose two methods: a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs and a systematic persona-based evaluation approach. These methods aim to expose qualitative differences in LLM responses based on user background and are independent of specific programming tasks or LLMs.

Result: The experimental evidence provided in the paper illustrates the utility of the proposed methods, showing their effectiveness in evaluating LLM-generated code across different user backgrounds.

Conclusion: The proposed synthetic and persona-based evaluation methods offer valuable tools for assessing the performance of LLMs in code generation, irrespective of specific tasks or models. The authors share their code to benefit the community.

Abstract: Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and
accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs
depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and
quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity
with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's
sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic
evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic
persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM
responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are
completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are
widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our
methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.

### [265] [What Users Value and Critique: Large-Scale Analysis of User Feedback on AI-Powered Mobile Apps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10785)
*Vinaik Chhetri,Krishna Upadhyay,A. B. Siddique,Umar Farooq*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper conducts a large-scale study on user feedback for AI-powered mobile apps using a dataset of 292 apps and 894K reviews. A multi-stage analysis pipeline is developed, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs into user topics. It reveals key themes in user feedback and provides fine-grained insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how users perceive, evaluate, and critique AI features in mobile apps, addressing the gap in understanding due to overwhelming user feedback volume.

Method: Developed a multi-stage analysis pipeline starting with human-labeled benchmark, evaluating LLMs and prompting strategies. The pipeline includes review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, validated for accuracy and consistency.

Result: Extracted over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Identified key themes in both positive and negative user feedback, providing fine-grained insights often missed by traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The approach offers a faithful reflection of real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps, uncovering universal satisfaction drivers and domain-specific frustrations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated
across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education,
entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and
critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the
overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first
comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps,
leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with
894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a
multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and
systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies.
Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and
clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables
scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million
aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics.
Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes:
positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized
assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g.,
scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language
support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and
frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained,
co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat
positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.
To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world
user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers
both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

### [266] [BugGen: A Self-Correcting Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline for Realistic RTL Bug Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10501)
*Surya Jasper,Minh Luu,Evan Pan,Aakash Tyagi,Michael Quinn,Jiang Hu,David Kebo Houngninou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces BugGen, an autonomous multi-agent pipeline using Large Language Models to generate realistic functional bugs in RTL for hardware verification. Evaluated on OpenTitan IP blocks, it produced unique bugs with high accuracy and throughput, exposed undetected bugs, outperformed Certitude, and improved ML-based failure triage models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification of complex hardware is becoming more challenging, driving the need for machine learning methods to improve debug efficiency. Existing bug insertion techniques fail to reliably produce diverse and scalable bug datasets required for ML-assisted debugging.

Method: BugGen uses a multi-agent pipeline with Large Language Models to systematically generate, insert, and validate functional bugs in RTL. It partitions modules, selects mutation targets via closed-loop agentic architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to ensure correctness and detectability.

Result: BugGen generated 500 unique bugs with 94% functional accuracy across five OpenTitan IP blocks, achieving a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour. It identified 104 previously undetected bugs and outperformed Certitude in syntactic accuracy and exposing testbench blind spots. Using BugGen-generated datasets for ML-based failure triage resulted in classification accuracies of 88.1%-93.2%.

Conclusion: BugGen provides a scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging significantly.

Abstract: Hardware complexity continues to strain verification resources, motivating
the adoption of machine learning (ML) methods to improve debug efficiency.
However, ML-assisted debugging critically depends on diverse and scalable bug
datasets, which existing manual or automated bug insertion methods fail to
reliably produce. We introduce BugGen, a first of its kind, fully autonomous,
multi-agent pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically
generate, insert, and validate realistic functional bugs in RTL. BugGen
partitions modules, selects mutation targets via a closed-loop agentic
architecture, and employs iterative refinement and rollback mechanisms to
ensure syntactic correctness and functional detectability. Evaluated across
five OpenTitan IP blocks, BugGen produced 500 unique bugs with 94% functional
accuracy and achieved a throughput of 17.7 validated bugs per hour-over five
times faster than typical manual expert insertion. Additionally, BugGen
identified 104 previously undetected bugs in OpenTitan regressions,
highlighting its utility in exposing verification coverage gaps. Compared
against Certitude, BugGen demonstrated over twice the syntactic accuracy,
deeper exposure of testbench blind spots, and more functionally meaningful and
complex bug scenarios. Furthermore, when these BugGen-generated datasets were
employed to train ML-based failure triage models, we achieved high
classification accuracy (88.1%-93.2%) across different IP blocks, confirming
the practical utility and realism of generated bugs. BugGen thus provides a
scalable solution for generating high-quality bug datasets, significantly
enhancing verification efficiency and ML-assisted debugging.

*Lianghong Guo,Yanlin Wang,Caihua Li,Pengyu Yang,Jiachi Chen,Wei Tao,Yingtian Zou,Duyu Tang,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline that simplifies the creation of large-scale datasets for GitHub issue resolution tasks. It includes SWE-Builder for environment construction, a standardized grading method, and automated validation. Experiments show its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating large-scale datasets for evaluating software engineering capabilities of LLMs is crucial but labor-intensive. The traditional process faces challenges in setting up evaluation environments, grading outcomes, and validating task instances.

Method: SWE-Factory integrates three components: SWE-Builder (a multi-agent system for environment construction), a standardized exit-code-based grading method, and automated fail2pass validation using exit code signals.

Result: Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that SWE-Factory constructs valid task instances efficiently and cost-effectively. The exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and recall of 1.00.

Conclusion: SWE-Factory accelerates the collection of large-scale, high-quality datasets for training and evaluating LLMs in GitHub issue resolution. Code and datasets are publicly available.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is
crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating
such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in
the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and
validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated
pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our
pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce
SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment
construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a
collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to
enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based
grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.
Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit
code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show
that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,
with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per
instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at
the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our
exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,
and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall
of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of
large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training
and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at

### [268] [The Gittins Index: A Design Principle for Decision-Making Under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10872)
*Ziv Scully,Alexander Terenin*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper aims to demonstrate the practical applications of the Gittins index in decision-making problems, despite its theoretical reputation and limited optimal problem-solving space. It provides an example-driven introduction and discusses several examples where it performs excellently even if not optimally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To change the perception of the Gittins index from a primarily theoretical concept to a practical tool for solving real-world decision-making problems.

Method: Providing an example-driven introduction to the Gittins index and walking through various problems it can solve, either optimally or with excellent suboptimal performance.

Result: Highlights two practical applications: applying the Gittins index to Bayesian optimization and minimizing tail latency in queues, showcasing its strong performance in these areas.

Conclusion: The Gittins index, although theoretically complex and limited in perfectly optimal problem-solving scenarios, can be effectively applied to practical problems with excellent results.

Abstract: The Gittins index is a tool that optimally solves a variety of
decision-making problems involving uncertainty, including multi-armed bandit
problems, minimizing mean latency in queues, and search problems like the
Pandora's box model. However, despite the above examples and later extensions
thereof, the space of problems that the Gittins index can solve perfectly
optimally is limited, and its definition is rather subtle compared to those of
other multi-armed bandit algorithms. As a result, the Gittins index is often
regarded as being primarily a concept of theoretical importance, rather than a
practical tool for solving decision-making problems.
  The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate that the Gittins index can be
fruitfully applied to practical problems. We start by giving an example-driven
introduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of
problems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent
performance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the
Gittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to
minimizing tail latency in queues.

*Zhecheng Liu,Jeff D. Eldredge*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: This paper proposes a transformer-based reinforcement learning framework for effective aerodynamic lift regulation in gust sequences via pitch control, demonstrating its superiority over proportional control and generalizability to different environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A linear flow control strategy may not remain effective in strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions. Therefore, it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy.

Method: Propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic lift in gust sequences via pitch control. Accelerate the training with pretraining and task-level transfer learning.

Result: The learned strategy outperforms the best proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts increases. The control strategy can effectively generalize to an environment with an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. Quarter-chord pitching control achieves superior lift regulation with less control effort compared to mid-chord pitching control.

Conclusion: The proposed transformer-based RL framework shows generalizability to different configurations and offers a promising approach to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined with the proposed acceleration techniques.

Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain
effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions,
but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the
present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic
lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the
challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We
demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques --
pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level
transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to
multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best
proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts
increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number
of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with
an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration
and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift
regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord
pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this
advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord
pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of
the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach
to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined
with the proposed acceleration techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真和高效的流体动力学模拟推动了众多科学和工程应用的进步。然而传统计算流体力学方法虽然具有强解释性和保证收敛性，但依赖于精细的空间和时间网格，导致计算成本高昂。而现有的物理信息神经网络（PINNs）和神经算子方法要么需要大量重新训练和调整，要么需要大型标注数据集，或者在平衡粗糙先验与高保真测量时变得不稳定。

Method: OmniFluids采用了物理预训练、粗网格算子蒸馏和少量样本微调相结合的方法。其关键组件包括算子混合、多帧解码器和分解傅里叶层，这些组件使得模型能够高效且可扩展地对多样物理任务进行建模，同时保持与基于物理的监督的无缝集成。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在有限数据可用的情况下，在复杂流体系统中实现高效和通用的代理建模建立了一个新的范式。

Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in
various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational
fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed
convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring
prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques.
However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely
data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware
methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss
functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing
coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce
OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that
integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and
few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction
under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key
components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder,
and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of
diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with
physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional
benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven
methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy,
delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately
recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work
establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling
in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for fine-grained control over music generation through inference-time interventions on MusicGen, enabling timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for more precise control over music generation to enable capabilities such as timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion.

Method: The method involves making inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer called MusicGen. This is achieved by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar manner. The regression task approach is used which provides improved performance.

Result: This approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion with improved performance. It also offers both global and local control over music generation when combined with the global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen.

Conclusion: The presented method allows for fine-grained control over music generation through inference-time interventions on MusicGen, providing both global and local control over music generation.

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through
inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer
called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and
genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes
trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar

performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve
meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the
global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides
both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating
our method are available at our demo page.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that preserve perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while enabling efficient storage and inference. They provide a practical alternative to continuous features for integration into large language models (LLMs). Existing studies often focus on specific domains or tasks without unified comparisons.

Method: The authors propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder, quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application domains. They evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks covering reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling.

Result: The evaluations highlight key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges in the field of discrete audio tokenization. The findings provide insights and guidance for future research.

Conclusion: This systematic review and benchmarking effort across speech, music, and general audio domains reveals important trade-offs and challenges in discrete audio tokenization, offering valuable guidance for advancing the field.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern

*Tony Alex,Wish Suharitdamrong,Sara Atito,Armin Mustafa,Philip J. B. Jackson,Imran Razzak,Muhammad Awais*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores how to improve audio-LLM interaction by modifying architectural design choices, resulting in a final architecture that achieves significant improvements over the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid progress in application-focused developments for Audio-LLMs, the underlying mechanisms governing efficient transfer of rich semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored.

Method: Starting with a standard audio-LLM architecture, the authors propose and evaluate several modifications based on hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles. These modifications include delaying audio integration, using the LLM layer's attention submodule exclusively, and integrating an ensemble of diverse audio encoders.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed modifications lead to relative improvements from 10% to 60% over the baseline, validating the approach to optimizing cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs.

Conclusion: The systematic investigation highlights effective strategies for enhancing audio-LLM interaction, providing insights into optimizing cross-modal information transfer.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models
(LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although
application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for
specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the
underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic
representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We
conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

### [274] [BNMusic: Blending Environmental Noises into Personalized Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10754)
*Chi Zuo,Martin B. Møller,Pablo Martínez-Nuevo,Huayang Huang,Yu Wu,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces BNMusic framework which blends environmental noises into personalized music to reduce noise noticeability, using cross-modal generation techniques and adaptive amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the limitation of traditional acoustic masking technique where misalignment between dominant sound and noise often requires excessive volume increase. Recent advances in cross-modal generation provide a new approach.

Method: The method involves two key stages: synthesizing a complete piece of music in mel-spectrogram representation that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise, then adaptively amplifying the generated music segment to reduce noise perception while preserving auditory quality.

Result: Experiments on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 show the effectiveness of the framework in blending environmental noise with rhythmically aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, reducing noise noticeability and improving acoustic experiences.

Conclusion: The BNMusic framework successfully reduces the noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music, enhancing overall acoustic experiences.

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique
is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks
to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However,
misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched
downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective
masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work,
we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the
noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music
generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music
generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises
into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first
stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation
that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we
adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise
perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory
quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench,
EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,
highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically
aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the
noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

*Abiodun Ganiyu,Pranshav Gajjar,Vijay K Shah*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper introduces AI5GTest, an AI-powered testing framework for O-RAN components that automates validation processes, reduces execution time, and maintains high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complex testing challenges of validating multi-vendor components in O-RAN's disaggregated architecture against specifications, and to overcome the limitations of existing frameworks such as reliance on manual processes, fragmentation, inconsistency, and scalability issues.

Method: AI5GTest leverages a cooperative Large Language Models (LLM) framework including Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM generates procedural flows based on specifications; Val-LLM validates compliance and detects deviations by cross-referencing signaling messages; Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis when anomalies arise. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is also incorporated for approval.

Result: Evaluated with test cases from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest significantly reduces overall test execution time compared to traditional manual methods while maintaining high validation accuracy.

Conclusion: AI5GTest offers an automated, specification-aware solution to the testing challenges in O-RAN, reducing time consumption and ensuring consistency and scalability.

Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the
telecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,
and rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces
complex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components
against O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as
those provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on
manual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to
inconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present
AI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to
automate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative
Large Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and
Debug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test
cases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references
signaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect
deviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,
providing insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and
trustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the
Gen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for
approval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test
cases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest
demonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to
traditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new extension to Space-O-RAN for lunar surface wireless communication systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lunar surface operations require wireless communication systems with autonomy, robustness to disruption, and adaptability to context.

Method: Incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols into Space-O-RAN.

Result: Distributed cognitive agents can implement wireless-aware coordination strategies and interact with MCP servers for decision making across different control layers.

Conclusion: This novel extension enhances Space-O-RAN's decision logic beyond static policies through semantic integration.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless
communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the
ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN
provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its
decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We
propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the
Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols,
allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and
non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers,
landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination
strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic
compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over
telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a practical deep learning (DL) approach for
energy-efficient traffic classification (TC) on resource-limited
microcontrollers, which are widely used in IoT-based smart systems and
communication networks. Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight

### [278] [Diffusion prior as a direct regularization term for FWI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10141)
*Yuke Xie,Hervé Chauris,Nicolas Desassis*

Main category: physics.geo-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to integrate DDPM as a generative diffusion prior into FWI through score rematching, eliminating reverse diffusion sampling and improving inversion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional applications of diffusion models for inverse problems like FWI require solving the full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states, which can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality.

Method: Directly integrate a pretrained DDPM as a score-based generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. This avoids reverse diffusion sampling, operates in clean image space, and introduces the generative diffusion prior as a regularization term in the standard FWI update rule.

Result: Numerical experiments indicate enhanced fidelity and robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while remaining practical and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves convergence behavior and inversion quality in FWI, offering a practical and efficient solution for seismic imaging and other inverse problem tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors
for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the
full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,
which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.
In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those
used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy
velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In
this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates
a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based
generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike
traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion
sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in
the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity
models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple
regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal
modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation
and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical
experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and
robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while
remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other
inverse problem tasks.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a method for automatically constructing a classifier using radar data, radio wave propagation models, and mathematical criteria. It uses data from 12 radars over two years, resulting in a model with 2669 coefficients. The optimal number of classes is found to be 37, with 25 frequently observed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated method for classifying processed data obtained from decameter coherent scatter radars using only the radar data, automatic modeling of radio wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating the quality of the models.

Method: The method involves training a model on data obtained by 12 radars from the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements was done using meteor trail scattered signals.

Result: The analysis determined that the optimal number of classes is 37, with 25 being frequently observed. 14 classes were chosen as confidently separable, and a preliminary interpretation of 10 of them was carried out.

Conclusion: The most important parameters for identifying the classes are the shape of the signal ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height, and the Doppler velocity measured by the radar. The results align with known physical mechanisms.

Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for
processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based
only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio
wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating
the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data
obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for
each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the
classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave
propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the
radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made
using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal
number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The
analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently
separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of
10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and
their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of
solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not
contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most
important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal
ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and
the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 元宇宙的兴起带来了对高质量视听体验的需求，但高分辨率虚拟场景数据在云平台和VR设备之间的传输受到带宽不足和信道质量差的影响，导致速度慢、延迟高和数据错误等问题，亟需一种更高效的传输解决方案。

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences
strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces
practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must
be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR
device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed
and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and
worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic
Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service
(SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic
transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By
deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key
semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut
latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel
interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction
rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the
SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image
quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Motivation: 当前方法将交通事故预测视为监督学习任务，但存在数据偏差、背景混淆等问题，难以识别事故的真实因果部分。

Method: 提出AVD模型，利用事故或无事故文本提示生成因果视频帧，同时保留帧的风格和内容；无需额外注释即可使用各种驾驶场景的数据集进行训练。同时引入EQ-TAA，采用等变三重损失函数，结合生成的对比伪正常和伪事故剪辑。

Result: 通过广泛的实验验证，AVD和EQ-TAA在性能上与现有最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AVD和EQ-TAA为交通场景中的事故预测提供了一种新方法，解决了背景混淆问题，并展示了良好的性能。

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

### [283] [HER2 Expression Prediction with Flexible Multi-Modal Inputs via Dynamic Bidirectional Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10006)
*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: A new framework is proposed for HER2 prediction in breast cancer that can use either single or dual modality data, improving accuracy and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HER2 assessment models analyze H&E or IHC images separately, but clinical practice benefits from analyzing them together. However, getting both types of images at the same time is difficult due to workflow complexity and cost.

Method: The framework has three key parts: a dynamic branch selector which decides if single or dual modality analysis should be used based on the input data, a bidirectional cross-modal GAN that reconstructs missing data using context-aware features, and a hybrid training protocol that combines adversarial learning and multi-task optimization.

Result: Single-modality H&E prediction improved from 71.44% to 94.25%, dual-modality accuracy reached 95.09%, and sole IHC input maintained 90.28% reliability. There were significant improvements over H&E/IHC baselines with respective accuracy improvements of 22.81%/12.90%. Cross-modal reconstruction enhanced F1-scores significantly.

Conclusion: This new 'dual-preferred, single-compatible' framework provides near-bimodal performance without needing simultaneous acquisition of both modalities, greatly benefiting resource-limited settings by reducing IHC infrastructure costs.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

*Kangwei Liu,Junwu Liu,Xiaowei Yi,Jinlin Guo,Yun Cao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: An audio-driven 3D facial animation method using a diffusion-based framework for controllable expressive animations is presented, which improves emotion similarity by 21.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation rely on single-modal control signals and deterministic regression-based mapping, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations.

Method: The method uses a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive learning and an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show that this method outperforms existing approaches across most metrics, achieving a 21.6% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving physiologically plausible facial dynamics.

Conclusion: This diffusion-based framework for controllable expressive 3D facial animation addresses the challenges of current methods by enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources and enriching motion diversity.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

*Weiyin Gong,Kai Zhang,Yanghai Zhang,Qi Liu,Xinjie Sun,Junyu Lu,Linbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces WDMIR, a new framework for multimodal intent recognition that emphasizes non-verbal information through frequency-domain analysis. It proposes a wavelet-driven fusion module and a cross-modal interaction mechanism. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance with notable improvements in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIR approaches focus on text analysis but often ignore the rich semantic content in non-verbal cues, leading to potential improvements by better integrating these modalities.

Method: The WDMIR framework includes: (1) a wavelet-driven fusion module for synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain; (2) a cross-modal interaction mechanism for progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to trimodal integration.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MIntRec dataset with a 1.13% increase in accuracy over previous methods. Ablation studies indicate a 0.41% rise in accuracy when analyzing subtle emotional cues using the wavelet-driven fusion module.

Conclusion: WDMIR enhances intent understanding by effectively utilizing non-verbal information, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal

*Von Ralph Dane Marquez Herbuela,Yukie Nagai*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了IEMOCAP语料库中双人互动的多模态情感耦合，使用区域特定运动捕捉，并发现非重叠语音在下脸和嘴巴区域引发更大的表现力，悲伤在非重叠时表现增加，愤怒在重叠时抑制手势。预测映射显示语调和MFCCs在发音区域有最高准确性，而唤醒和效价的关联性较低且更依赖于情境。值得注意的是，低唤醒和重叠语音增强了手语同步性，但与效价无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类情感表达通过协调的声音、面部和手势信号出现。理解情感表达语音与区域性面部和手部运动之间的动态联系对于深入了解真实互动中的情感和行为线索的传达至关重要。此外，对话结构如轮流发言和同时说话也影响这些动态关系。

Method: 研究使用IEMOCAP语料库中的双人互动数据进行多模态情感耦合分析。语音特征包括低级韵律、MFCCs以及模型导出的唤醒度、效价和分类情感（快乐、悲伤、愤怒、中立），并与3D面部和手部标记位移对齐。通过帧间位移幅度量化表现活跃性，并将语音特征映射到面部和手部运动以进行预测。

Result: 非重叠语音在下脸和嘴部区域引发了更高的表现活跃性。悲伤在非重叠情况下表现出增强的表现力，而愤怒在重叠情况下抑制了手势。预测映射显示，语调和MFCCs在发音区域具有最高的准确性，而唤醒和效价的相关性较低且更具情境敏感性。值得注意的是，低唤醒和重叠语音增强了手语同步性，但与效价无关。

Conclusion: 通过研究多模态情感耦合，我们增进了对真实互动中情感和行为线索传达的理解，提高了实时情感检测的准确性和跨模态同步性。

Abstract: Human emotional expression emerges through coordinated vocal, facial, and
gestural signals. While speech face alignment is well established, the broader
dynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand
motion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and
behavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the
coordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn
taking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and
simultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this
alignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances
realtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony
across modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study
examines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from
dyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level
prosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions
(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker
displacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise
displacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech
features to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently
elicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness
showed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed
gestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for
prosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower
and more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was
enhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence.

*Hossein A. Rahmani,Varsha Ramineni,Nick Craswell,Bhaskar Mitra,Emine Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper investigates the reliability of synthetic test collections created using LLMs for evaluating IR systems, showing significant bias in absolute system performance but less so in relative comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in creating diverse user queries and obtaining relevance judgments for IR system evaluation, exploring the potential of LLM-generated synthetic datasets.

Method: Thoroughly investigate synthetic test collections built with LLMs to generate queries, labels, or both. Examine potential biases empirically and validate with a linear mixed-effects model.

Result: Significant bias found in absolute system performance evaluations using synthetic test collections, but less impact on relative system performance comparisons.

Conclusion: Synthetic test collections have potential for IR system evaluation, but their biases need to be carefully considered, especially for absolute performance metrics.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR)
systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be
challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well
retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive.
Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to
generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs
to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous
work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have
the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is
needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the
reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs
are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we
examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are
used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in
evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation.
We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects
model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation
results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for
e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as
significant in comparing relative system performance. Codes and data are

### [291] [Contrastive Matrix Completion with Denoising and Augmented Graph Views for Robust Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10658)
*Narges Nemati,Mostafa Haghir Chehreghani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCCL, a method using contrastive learning for matrix completion in recommender systems to address overfitting and sensitivity to noisy edges issues with GNN-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural network (GNN)-based methods for matrix completion are sensitive to noisy or irrelevant edges and prone to overfitting, which limits their generalizability.

Method: The proposed method, Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning (MCCL), extracts local neighborhood subgraphs for each interaction and generates two distinct graph representations. The first representation focuses on denoising through GNN layers with an attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational autoencoder aligning feature distribution with a standard prior. A mutual learning loss function harmonizes these representations during training.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show that MCCL improves numerical accuracy of predicted scores by up to 0.8% in RMSE and enhances ranking metrics by up to 36%.

Conclusion: MCCL effectively addresses the challenges faced by current GNN-based methods in matrix completion, improving both accuracy and generalizability.

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as
predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a
comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural
network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant
edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to
overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning
(MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each
interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The
first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an
attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational
autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A
mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually
harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns
and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on
several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the
numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement
in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in
ranking metrics.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LightKG是一种简化版的GNN模型，针对稀疏交互场景进行了优化，在保证推荐效果的同时大幅减少了训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的知识图谱感知推荐系统在稀疏交互场景下表现不佳，复杂模型可能增加学习难度，而SSL方法虽然有助于解决稀疏性问题，但会延长训练时间。

Method: 提出了一种简化的GNN层，将有向关系编码为标量对而非稠密嵌入，并采用线性聚合框架以降低复杂度；同时引入高效的对比层实现自监督学习，直接最小化原图中的节点相似性，避免了耗时的子图生成与比较过程。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，LightKG在稀疏和密集场景中均优于12个竞争性的KGRS模型，平均提高了5.8%的推荐准确性，并比带SSL的KGRS节省了84.3%的训练时间。

Conclusion: LightKG作为一种简单而强大的GNN模型，有效解决了稀疏性问题，显著提升了推荐系统的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for
Knowledge Graph-aware Recommender Systems (KGRSs) due to their proven
effectiveness. Building upon GNN-based KGRSs, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
has been incorporated to address the sparity issue, leading to longer training
time. However, through extensive experiments, we reveal that: (1)compared to
other KGRSs, the existing GNN-based KGRSs fail to keep their superior
performance under sparse interactions even with SSL. (2) More complex models
tend to perform worse in sparse interaction scenarios and complex mechanisms,
like attention mechanism, can be detrimental as they often increase learning
difficulty. Inspired by these findings, we propose LightKG, a simple yet
powerful GNN-based KGRS to address sparsity issues. LightKG includes a
simplified GNN layer that encodes directed relations as scalar pairs rather
than dense embeddings and employs a linear aggregation framework, greatly
reducing the complexity of GNNs. Additionally, LightKG incorporates an
efficient contrastive layer to implement SSL. It directly minimizes the node
similarity in original graph, avoiding the time-consuming subgraph generation
and comparison required in previous SSL methods. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that LightKG outperforms 12 competitive KGRSs in both sparse and
dense scenarios while significantly reducing training time. Specifically, it
surpasses the best baselines by an average of 5.8\% in recommendation accuracy
and saves 84.3\% of training time compared to KGRSs with SSL. Our code is

*Shuaiqi Sun,Congde Yuan,Haoqiang Yang,Mengzhuo Guo,Guiying Wei,Jiangbo Tian*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: In digital gaming, predicting long-term user lifetime value (LTV) is crucial but challenging due to delayed payment behavior, sparse data, and outliers. Existing models either underestimate LTV or lack robustness. This paper introduces SHORE, a framework that uses short-horizon predictions as auxiliary tasks and a hybrid loss function to improve long-term LTV prediction accuracy and robustness. Experiments show SHORE significantly outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction in digital gaming is essential for monetization strategies but difficult due to delayed payments, sparse early user data, and high-value outliers. Current models relying on short-cycle observations or strong distributional assumptions often underestimate long-term value or lack robustness.

Method: The paper proposes SHORE, a novel LTV prediction framework. It integrates short-horizon predictions as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle targets and introduces a hybrid loss function combining order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to handle zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.

Result: Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets show that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91% relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment.

Conclusion: SHORE demonstrates practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale LTV prediction for digital games.

Abstract: In digital gaming, long-term user lifetime value (LTV) prediction is
essential for monetization strategy, yet presents major challenges due to
delayed payment behavior, sparse early user data, and the presence of
high-value outliers. While existing models typically rely on either short-cycle
observations or strong distributional assumptions, such approaches often
underestimate long-term value or suffer from poor robustness. To address these
issues, we propose SHort-cycle auxiliary with Order-preserving REgression
(SHORE), a novel LTV prediction framework that integrates short-horizon
predictions (e.g., LTV-15 and LTV-30) as auxiliary tasks to enhance long-cycle
targets (e.g., LTV-60). SHORE also introduces a hybrid loss function combining
order-preserving multi-class classification and a dynamic Huber loss to
mitigate the influence of zero-inflation and outlier payment behavior.
Extensive offline and online experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that SHORE significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving a 47.91\%
relative reduction in prediction error in online deployment. These results
highlight SHORE's practical effectiveness and robustness in industrial-scale
LTV prediction for digital games.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces MGOE, a novel framework for graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale. It leverages macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific features and model correlations between tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both offline experiments and online A/B tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale is challenging due to distinct graphs corresponding to different tasks. Existing methods often neglect these graph structures, leading to missed opportunities for performance improvement.

Method: The paper proposes the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, which includes the concept of Macro Graph Bottom for effective incorporation of graph information and the Macro Prediction Tower for dynamic integration of macro knowledge across tasks.

Result: MGOE demonstrates superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods through extensive offline experiments on three public benchmark datasets and online A/B tests in a billion-scale recommender system.

Conclusion: MGOE establishes a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based recommendation by effectively leveraging macro graph embeddings and modeling task correlations.

Abstract: Graph-based multi-task learning at billion-scale presents a significant
challenge, as different tasks correspond to distinct billion-scale graphs.
Traditional multi-task learning methods often neglect these graph structures,
relying solely on individual user and item embeddings. However, disregarding
graph structures overlooks substantial potential for improving performance. In
this paper, we introduce the Macro Graph of Expert (MGOE) framework, the first
approach capable of leveraging macro graph embeddings to capture task-specific
macro features while modeling the correlations between task-specific experts.
Specifically, we propose the concept of a Macro Graph Bottom, which, for the
first time, enables multi-task learning models to incorporate graph information
effectively. We design the Macro Prediction Tower to dynamically integrate
macro knowledge across tasks. MGOE has been deployed at scale, powering
multi-task learning for the homepage of a leading billion-scale recommender
system. Extensive offline experiments conducted on three public benchmark
datasets demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art multi-task learning
methods, establishing MGOE as a breakthrough in multi-task graph-based
recommendation. Furthermore, online A/B tests confirm the superiority of MGOE
in billion-scale recommender systems.

### [295] [Precise Zero-Shot Pointwise Ranking with LLMs through Post-Aggregated Global Context Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10859)
*Kehan Long,Shasha Li,Chen Xu,Jintao Tang,Ting Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise Ranking (GCCP) strategy and Post-Aggregation with Global Context (PAGC) method for zero-shot document ranking. These innovations improve pointwise ranking effectiveness while retaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing pointwise methods, which lack comparative insights between documents leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal performance. The aim is to enhance the effectiveness of pointwise methods without sacrificing their efficiency.

Method: 1. Propose a GCCP strategy that introduces global reference comparisons by creating an anchor document as a query-focused summary of pseudo-relevant candidates to capture global context. 2. Develop a PAGC method where contrastive relevance scores from GCCP can be post-aggregated with existing pointwise methods, incorporating essential global context information without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments on TREC DL and BEIR benchmarks show significant improvement over previous pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. The method also performs competitively against more computationally intensive comparative methods.

Conclusion: The GCCP strategy and PAGC method effectively improve pointwise ranking effectiveness while preserving efficiency, validated through extensive experiments and analyses.

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting
strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high
effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for
larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior
efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores
for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical
comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of
pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key
innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise
Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between
each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores.
We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of
pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by
capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive
relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise
methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a
training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR
benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous
pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also
achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require
substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the
efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for enzyme function prediction from sequence using machine learning methods. CARE focuses on two tasks: classification of protein sequences by EC number and retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. The authors provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods in the classification task and propose a new method called CREEP for the retrieval task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate machine learning methods for predicting enzyme function from sequence.

Method: CARE is a benchmark and dataset suite for the Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). It centers on two tasks: classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, train-test splits are designed to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution generalization. Baselines for state-of-the-art methods are provided for the classification task, and a new method called Contrastive Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) is proposed for the retrieval task.

Result: CARE provides a standardized benchmark for evaluating machine learning methods for enzyme function prediction from sequence. The proposed method, CREEP, performs well on the retrieval task and is compared to the recent method, CLIPZyme.

Conclusion: CARE is a valuable resource for the development and evaluation of machine learning methods for enzyme function prediction from sequence.

Abstract: Enzymes are important proteins that catalyze chemical reactions. In recent
years, machine learning methods have emerged to predict enzyme function from
sequence; however, there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate these
methods. We introduce CARE, a benchmark and dataset suite for the
Classification And Retrieval of Enzymes (CARE). CARE centers on two tasks: (1)
classification of a protein sequence by its enzyme commission (EC) number and
(2) retrieval of an EC number given a chemical reaction. For each task, we
design train-test splits to evaluate different kinds of out-of-distribution
generalization that are relevant to real use cases. For the classification
task, we provide baselines for state-of-the-art methods. Because the retrieval
task has not been previously formalized, we propose a method called Contrastive
Reaction-EnzymE Pretraining (CREEP) as one of the first baselines for this task
and compare it to the recent method, CLIPZyme. CARE is available at

### [297] [Identifying critical residues of a protein using meaningfully-thresholded Random Geometric Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10015)
*Chuqiao Zhang,Sarath Chandra Dantu,Debarghya Mitra,Dalia Chakrabarty*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: This paper proposes three methods for identifying critical residues in a protein using Random Geometric Graph (RGG) and molecular dynamical simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical residues of proteins are essential for their function, but identification remains challenging.

Method: The first method uses an organic thresholding technique to learn an RGG based on residue-pair correlations. The second method ranks the differences between posterior probabilities of full graph variables and those with one residue omitted. The third method examines the dynamic variation of nodal degrees during the simulation.

Result: The results obtained from these three distinct criticality parameters were compared against experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Conclusion: These proposed methods provide new ways to identify critical residues in proteins.

Abstract: Identification of critical residues of a protein is actively pursued, since
such residues are essential for protein function. We present three ways of
recognising critical residues of an example protein, the evolution of which is
tracked via molecular dynamical simulations. Our methods are based on learning
a Random Geometric Graph (RGG) variable, where the state variable of each of
156 residues, is attached to a node of this graph, with the RGG learnt using
the matrix of correlations between state variables of each residue-pair. Given
the categorical nature of the state variable, correlation between a residue
pair is computed using Cramer's V. We advance an organic thresholding to learn
an RGG, and compare results against extant thresholding techniques, when
parametrising criticality as the nodal degree in the learnt RGG. Secondly, we
develop a criticality measure by ranking the computed differences between the
posterior probability of the full graph variable defined on all 156 residues,
and that of the graph with all but one residue omitted. A third parametrisation
of criticality informs on the dynamical variation of nodal degrees as the
protein evolves during the simulation. Finally, we compare results obtained
with the three distinct criticality parameters, against
experimentally-ascertained critical residues.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model
parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software
ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly
alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of
user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem
has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This
dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with
performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms
poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming
paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language
extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations
in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur
substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary
potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks.
However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly
for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this
limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA
and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic
optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based
data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating
LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU
transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our
framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential
of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and
accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is
crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings.
A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized
to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners'
questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators.
To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a
comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas:
language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for
validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we
generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot,
1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using
three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our
findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from
the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to
tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

### [300] [On feature selection in double-imbalanced data settings: a Random Forest approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10929)
*Fabio Demaria*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel thresholding scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth to address double imbalance conditions in high-dimensional classification tasks, demonstrating improved accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature selection methods used with Random Forests often produce unreliable results when dealing with class imbalance and dimensional asymmetry $(n \gg p)$.

Method: A new thresholding scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth is introduced, utilizing tree topology to evaluate variable relevance.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed method yields more accurate and parsimonious subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal depth-based selection.

Conclusion: This approach offers an effective and interpretable solution for variable selection in Random Forests under double imbalance conditions.

Abstract: Feature selection is a critical step in high-dimensional classification
tasks, particularly under challenging conditions of double imbalance, namely
settings characterized by both class imbalance in the response variable and
dimensional asymmetry in the data $(n \gg p)$. In such scenarios, traditional
feature selection methods applied to Random Forests (RF) often yield unstable
or misleading importance rankings. This paper proposes a novel thresholding
scheme for feature selection based on minimal depth, which exploits the tree
topology to assess variable relevance. Extensive experiments on simulated and
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach produces more
parsimonious and accurate subsets of variables compared to conventional minimal
depth-based selection. The method provides a practical and interpretable
solution for variable selection in RF under double imbalance conditions.

### [301] [FastFLUX: Pruning FLUX with Block-wise Replacement and Sandwich Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10035)
*Fuhan Cai,Yong Guo,Jie Li,Wenbo Li,Xiangzhong Fang,Jian Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have led to expressive models like FLUX, but they suffer from slow inference and high memory usage. Existing acceleration methods often degrade performance. This paper proposes FastFLUX, an architecture-level pruning framework for FLUX that uses Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) and Sandwich Training (ST). Experiments show FastFLUX maintains high image quality while improving inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current text-to-image generation models such as slow inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability, as well as the significant performance degradation and substantial training costs of existing acceleration methods.

Method: Propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level pruning framework for FLUX, which includes Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method to replace complex residual branches with lightweight linear layers while preserving shortcut connections, and Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning strategy using LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed even when 20% of the hierarchy is pruned.

Conclusion: FastFLUX enhances the inference efficiency of FLUX by introducing BRLL and ST, maintaining high image quality while improving inference speed.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the
emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs),
exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow
inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration
methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer
from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs.
To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level
pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its
core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which
replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight
linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability.
Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning
strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating
performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our
FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of
the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

### [302] [Ambient Diffusion Omni: Training Good Models with Bad Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10038)
*Giannis Daras,Adrian Rodriguez-Munoz,Adam Klivans,Antonio Torralba,Constantinos Daskalakis*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ambient Diffusion Omni, a framework that leverages low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to improve the quality of diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To utilize lower-quality images that are often discarded during curation of datasets for training diffusion models in order to extract valuable signal from all available images.

Method: Exploiting spectral power law decay and locality properties of natural images, the framework successfully trains diffusion models with synthetically corrupted images (Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, motion blur). It provides theoretical justification by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art ImageNet FID and showed significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling.

Conclusion: Noise dampens the initial skew between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution observed, making it possible to train better models using diverse and low-quality data.

Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to
improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are
trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from
the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the
lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion
Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract
signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two
properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first
validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images
synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We
then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show
significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image
generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew
between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we
actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our
approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus
limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

### [303] [Learning-based density-equalizing map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10027)
*Yanwen Huang,Lok Ming Lui,Gary P. T. Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a learning-based density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks that overcomes limitations of traditional methods by providing superior accuracy, avoiding artifacts, and generalizing from 2D to 3D without structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DEM approaches face challenges such as limited accuracy, overlapping artifacts in extreme cases, and substantial redesign when extended from 2D to 3D.

Method: The authors introduce LDEM, a novel framework using deep neural networks with a loss function that enforces density uniformity and geometric regularity. They utilize a hierarchical approach to predict transformations at both coarse and dense levels.

Result: LDEM demonstrates superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior methods for various density distributions and can be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. It also generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps for practical applications.

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.
