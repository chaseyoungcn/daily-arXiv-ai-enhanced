This\nparadigm involves deploying a model provided by a third party on local devices\nto perform inference tasks. However, it exposes the private model to two\nprimary security threats: model stealing (MS) and membership inference attacks\n(MIA). To mitigate these risks, existing wisdom deploys models within Trusted\nExecution Environments (TEEs), which is a secure isolated execution space.\nNonetheless, the constrained secure memory capacity in TEEs makes it\nchallenging to achieve full model security with low inference latency. This\npaper fills the gap with TensorShield, the first efficient on-device inference\nwork that shields partial tensors of the model while still fully defending\nagainst MS and MIA. The key enabling techniques in TensorShield include: (i) a\nnovel eXplainable AI (XAI) technique exploits the model's attention transition\nto assess critical tensors and shields them in TEE to achieve secure inference,\nand (ii) two meticulous designs with critical feature identification and\nlatency-aware placement to accelerate inference while maintaining security.\nExtensive evaluations show that TensorShield delivers almost the same security\nprotection as shielding the entire model inside TEE, while being up to\n25.35$\\times$ (avg. 5.85$\\times$) faster than the state-of-the-art work,\nwithout accuracy loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "TensorShield is an efficient on-device inference method that protects critical tensors of a model in TEEs, providing security against MS and MIA while significantly reducing latency compared to shielding the entire model.", "motivation": "On-device inference is crucial for safeguarding user data privacy, but existing methods struggle to balance full model security with low inference latency when using TEEs due to memory constraints.", "method": "TensorShield uses a novel XAI technique to identify and shield critical tensors in TEEs, along with two designs for critical feature identification and latency-aware placement to ensure secure and fast inference.", "result": "Evaluations demonstrate TensorShield offers similar security to protecting the whole model within TEEs, yet it's up to 25.35$\\times$ (avg. 5.85$\\times$) faster than current top solutions without sacrificing accuracy.", "conclusion": "TensorShield successfully addresses the challenge of achieving both strong security and high efficiency in on-device inference by selectively protecting tensors."}}

These multi-agent debate (MAD)\napproaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine\narguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse\nperspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a\nsystematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods,\nparticularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to\nfill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling\ntechnique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration\ncapabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD\nwith strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning\nand safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of\ntask difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key\nfindings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages\nover self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem\ndifficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little\nbenefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can\nincrease vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations\nfacilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative\nrefinement process.

Those debates drew from\nmid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more\nidealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st\ncentury cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories\nto artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this\nhistory.

This growth is\naccompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the\nmemory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous\napproaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While\nthese methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training\nis significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets.\nMotivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can\nparameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while\nachieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the\nperformance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are\nthe following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that\nsummarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform\na benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training\napproaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We\nobserve that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank\ntraining delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that\nincorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving\ntheir performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely\nweight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of\nefficient pre-training methods.

MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four\nphases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery,\nand knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs\nin real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing\nthe GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes\nthrough pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by\nrolling back to previously stable states.

In artificial neural networks, this\nis typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by\ninjecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters\nthemselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as\nserotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn\nweights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.\nRather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we\noptimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To\naccomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as\nthe minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric\nmovement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects\na single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for\na particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.\nFirst, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a\nconvenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.\nSecond, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging\ngeneralization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several\ntopologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.\nnoise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their\nsimplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks\nby input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.\nThese results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds\noffers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u6ed1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u6ed1\u6d41\u5f62\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u7528\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u800c\u5927\u8111\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u8c03\u8282\u5242\uff08\u5982\u8840\u6e05\u7d20\uff09\u8c03\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u6ed1\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u91cf\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "method": "\u4e0d\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u6743\u91cd\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5149\u6ed1\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5176\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53d7\u4f53\u79ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u8be5\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u79cd\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u7ebf\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u548c\u692d\u5706\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u65cb\u8f6c\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u8fde\u63a5\u5bf9\u76f8\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6837\u672c\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8c03\u5236\u6743\u91cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs\nfor a target forecasting task.

To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset\nof 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English\noriginals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new\ntranslations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,\nMalagasy, Setswana, Tahitian).

Therefore, this paper aims to\nexplore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with\nimperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three\nrepresentative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate\ncontrol (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how\ninput characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between\nthem make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural\nnetwork-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under\nlimited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the\nthree interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse\nenvironment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating\nimperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL\nagent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping\nand control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs,\nachieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast,\nreward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive\nto imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the\nimportance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect\ninputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u5019\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347RL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u653f\u7b56\u5851\u9020\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5171\u4eab\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u5229\u6da6\u63d0\u9ad88.4%\u548c6.8%\uff0c\u800c\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u7b97\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8f93\u5165\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5229\u6da6\u4e0b\u964d9.4%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c14\u5019\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ba4\u751f\u4ea7\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u4f5c\u7269\u751f\u957f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u5230\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u6709\u9650\u548c\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fRL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\uff08\u79cd\u690d\u8005\uff09\u8f93\u5165\u4e0eRL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fRL\u5c1a\u672a\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u5019\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u5851\u9020\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5171\u4eab\uff09\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u5019\u63a7\u5236\u5b9a\u5236\u3002\n2. \u5206\u6790\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u5e38\u76f8\u4e92\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u6743\u8861\u4f7f\u79cd\u690d\u8005\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5584\u3002\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fRL\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\n4. \u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6e29\u5ba4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e09\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6f14\u793a\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u79cd\u690d\u8005\u8f93\u5165\u7eb3\u5165\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fRL\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8RL\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5f71\u54cd\u884c\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u7684RL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u653f\u7b56\u5851\u9020\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5171\u4eab\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868.4%\u548c6.8%\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8f93\u5165\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5229\u6da6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e869.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u5019\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fRL\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we\npresent GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and\ntemporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.\nGeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training\ndata and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.\nTo overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to\nestimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then\nconditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as\nan image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of\ngeometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role\nto focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video\ndatasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and\ngeneralizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the\nchallenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth\nrepresentation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be\nestimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional\naffine-invariant and metric depth representations.

Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates\n\"Regeneration\" and \"Meta-Prompt Adaptation\" mechanisms to substantially broaden\nexploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial\ndialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by\ngenerating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM.\nWe also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological\ncounseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating\nMCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned\nconversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge\nof consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "MCTSr-Zero\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u3001\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u91cd\u751f\u548c\u5143\u63d0\u793a\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u6765\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5fc3\u7406\u8f85\u5bfc\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u679c\u5bfc\u5411\u7684MCTS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5982\u5fc3\u7406\u8f85\u5bfc\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e3b\u89c2\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u5171\u60c5\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "MCTSr-Zero\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u201c\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u201d\u4ee5\u5c06\u641c\u7d22\u76ee\u6807\u4ece\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7ec8\u6001\u8f6c\u5411\u7b26\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u91cd\u751f\u201d\u548c\u201c\u5143\u63d0\u793a\u9002\u5e94\u201d\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03LLM\uff08PsyLLM\uff09\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6PsyEval\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aPsyLLM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MCTSr-Zero\u6709\u6548\u5730\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u539f\u5219\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5fc3\u7406\u6807\u51c6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3002"}}

However, the constraints of real-time control are often\nat odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds\nof billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and\noperate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are\nrequired for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models\nhave used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action\nexperts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new\nuntrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules\nimprove real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether\nthey preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained\nVLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we\nstudy this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion\nor flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts\nsignificantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an\nextensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and\nknowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone\nduring VLA training that mitigates this issue.

For\nexample, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be\nboth surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper\ncrafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical\nfor a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion\nfor Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the\nnew task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with\natypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts\natypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their\nuser-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to\nrerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system\ndevelopment and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are\nmanually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially\ngenerated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect\nutility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic\nselection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based\njudgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that\nserendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with\nground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual\nannotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility.

We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm\nthat organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than\nfixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles,\nensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video\nduration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories\nand converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing\nredundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive\nlearning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across\nmultiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a\nlarge margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with\n10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for\nbeing the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2%\nperformance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster\ntraining time and 18x less inference FLOPs.

We utilize\nthe Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play\nflow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the\ndegree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the\nregularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In\nparticular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex\nfunctional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with\nrespect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which then ensures the existence of\nits unique fixed point, which is then shown to be the unique global minimizer\nfor our optimization problem.

However, improving their\nspatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on\nadditional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their\nutility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this\npaper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial\nreasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which\nrely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our\nkey insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward\nvisual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder\narchitecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and\na spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to\nextract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into\nunified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we\npropose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects\nthe spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under\nlimited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial\nreasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k\ndataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.\nExtensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nspatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of\nvisual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

At each round, the principal\nstrategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent\nof unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the\nprovided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The\nobjective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight.\nWithout prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes\nintractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where\nsublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the\narm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this\nsetting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of\n$O(\\min\\{\\sqrt{KT\\log N},K\\sqrt{T}\\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to\na $\\log K$ factor.

The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor\nscalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised\nmethod that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically\nimproving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from\nsynthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the\nunique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D\ndiffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate\nrealistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and\nwavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative\nkeypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield\nmajor speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW\napplied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to\nreal-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further\nimproves with fine-tuning on real data.

Our theoretical results reveal that Muon can benefit from\nthe low-rank and approximate blockwise diagonal structure of Hessian matrices\n-- phenomena widely observed in practical neural network training. Our\nexperimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u79e9\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u523b\u753b\u4e86Muon\u4f18\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMuon\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4f4e\u79e9\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Muon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u79e9\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5757\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u3002"}}
