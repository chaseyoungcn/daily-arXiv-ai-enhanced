A widely adopted\nstrategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the\nmodel's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers.\nHowever, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely\nreflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice.

In most existing\nsystems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language.

The semantic\nspace of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional\nvector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and\nbehavioral drift.

The standard\nnext-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment\nrequired for robust, scalable agent coordination.

This study introduces TaxAgent,\na novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling\n(ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation,\nheterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors\nwhile the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax\nrates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal\nTaxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves\nsuperior equity-efficiency trade-offs.

Prior\nwork has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability,\nmeasured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these\nbenchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt\nto persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly\n``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a\nterrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails.\nMoreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior\nin pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI\nsystems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts\nthe focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a\nmodel's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior.\nOur evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational\nsetup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse\nspectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and\nnon-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model\nto identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of\npersuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are\nfrequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that\njailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results\nhighlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of\nevaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

Neural\nnetworks and kernel-based methods are commonly employed for this task due to\ntheir capacity for fast and parallel computation. The approximation\ncapabilities, or expressive power, of these methods have been extensively\nstudied over the past 35 years. In this paper, we will present examples of key\nideas in this area found in the literature. We will discuss emerging trends in\nmachine learning including the role of shallow/deep networks, approximation on\nmanifolds, physics-informed neural surrogates, neural operators, and\ntransformer architectures. Despite function approximation being a fundamental\nproblem in machine learning, approximation theory does not play a central role\nin the theoretical foundations of the field. One unfortunate consequence of\nthis disconnect is that it is often unclear how well trained models will\ngeneralize to unseen or unlabeled data. In this review, we examine some of the\nshortcomings of the current machine learning framework and explore the reasons\nfor the gap between approximation theory and machine learning practice. We will\nthen introduce our novel research to achieve function approximation on unknown\nmanifolds without the need to learn specific manifold features, such as the\neigen-decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator or atlas construction.

It has\nalso been observed that their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of\nrate matrices, particularly between uniform and absorbing rate matrices. While\nempirical results suggest that absorbing rate matrices often yield better\ngeneration quality compared to uniform rate matrices, existing theoretical\nworks have largely focused on the uniform rate matrices case. Notably,\nconvergence guarantees and error analyses for absorbing diffusion models are\nstill missing. In this work, we provide the first finite-time error bounds and\nconvergence rate analysis for discrete diffusion models using absorbing rate\nmatrices. We begin by deriving an upper bound on the KL divergence of the\nforward process, introducing a surrogate initialization distribution to address\nthe challenge posed by the absorbing stationary distribution, which is a\nsingleton and causes the KL divergence to be ill-defined. We then establish the\nfirst convergence guarantees for both the $\\tau$-leaping and uniformization\nsamplers under absorbing rate matrices, demonstrating improved rates over their\ncounterparts using uniform rate matrices.

To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a\npromising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with\nsignificantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However,\nwhile DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets\nremains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the\npresence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across\ndifferent classes.

However,\nthese potential goals are not explicitly represented in the collected\ntrajectories. To learn a generalizable goal-conditioned policy, it is common to\nsample goals and state-action pairs uniformly using dynamic programming methods\nsuch as Q-learning. Uniform sampling, however, requires an intractably large\ndataset to cover all possible combinations and creates many unreachable\nstate-goal-action pairs that degrade policy performance. Our key insight is\nthat sampling should favor transitions that enable goal achievement. To this\nend, we propose Reachability Weighted Sampling (RWS). RWS uses a reachability\nclassifier trained via positive-unlabeled (PU) learning on goal-conditioned\nstate-action values. The classifier maps these values to a reachability score,\nwhich is then used as a sampling priority. RWS is a plug-and-play module that\nintegrates seamlessly with standard offline RL algorithms. Experiments on six\ncomplex simulated robotic manipulation tasks, including those with a robot arm\nand a dexterous hand, show that RWS significantly improves performance.

This problem is particularly relevant to\noncological treatments, where precise image alignment is necessary for tracking\ntumor growth, assessing treatment response, and ensuring accurate delivery of\ntherapies. Recent AI methods can outperform traditional techniques in accuracy\nand speed, yet they often produce unreliable deformations that limit their\nclinical adoption. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a\nnovel implicit registration framework that can predict accurate and reliable\ndeformations. Our insight is to reformulate image registration as a signal\nreconstruction problem: we learn a kernel function that can recover the dense\ndisplacement field from sparse keypoint correspondences. We integrate our\nmethod in a novel hierarchical architecture, and estimate the displacement\nfield in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our formulation also allows for efficient\nrefinement at test time, permitting clinicians to easily adjust registrations\nwhen needed.

However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model\nrepresentations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing\nsignatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This\nraises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds\nwith their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help\nidentify said features and gain further insights into neural network\nrepresentations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based\napproach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from\nsparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a\nsequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and\nnonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs\non a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical\nconcepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are\nunable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE\nrecovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the\nseemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a\nvision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features\nare solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the\nsequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of\nadaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest.\nOverall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that\ninterpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with\nmethods emerging from assumptions that fit it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(SAEs)\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1MP-SAE\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMP-SAE\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e14\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u5206\u5c42\u3001\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22SAEs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u907f\u514d\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u662f\u5426\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5339\u914d\u8ffd\u8e2a(MP)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51faMP-SAE\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c55\u5f00\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6b8b\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83MP-SAE\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709SAEs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "(i) \u5206\u5c42\u6982\u5ff5\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u6b63\u4ea4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709SAEs\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\uff1b(ii) MP-SAE\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMP-SAE\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u539f\u5219\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4ece\u8868\u793a\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u51fa\u53d1\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0e\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

To better understand today's language models,\nwe investigate how both classical architectures (BERT, DeBERTa, GPT-2)and\ncontemporary large language models (Pythia, OLMo-2, Gemma-2, Qwen2.5,\nLlama-3.1) represent lexical identity and inflectional morphology. We train\nlinear and nonlinear classifiers on layer-wise activations to predict word\nlemmas and inflectional features. We discover that models concentrate lexical\ninformation linearly in early layers and increasingly nonlinearly in later\nlayers, while keeping inflectional information uniformly accessible and\nlinearly separable throughout the layers. Further analysis reveals that these\nmodels encode inflectional morphology through generalizable abstractions, but\nrely predominantly on memorization to encode lexical identity. Remarkably,\nthese patterns emerge across all 16 models we test, despite differences in\narchitecture, size, and training regime (including pretrained and\ninstruction-tuned variants). This consistency suggests that, despite\nsubstantial advances in LLM technologies, transformer models organize\nlinguistic information in similar ways, indicating that these properties could\nbe fundamental for next token prediction and are learned early during\npretraining.

Recently, the sampling method based on\ngranular-ball (GB) has shown promising performance in generality and noisy\nclassification tasks. However, some limitations remain, including the absence\nof borderline sampling strategies and issues with class boundary blurring or\nshrinking due to overlap between GBs.

First, a\nrestricted diffusion-based GB generation (RD-GBG) method is proposed, which\nprevents GB overlaps by constrained expansion, preserving precise geometric\nrepresentation of GBs via redefined ones. Second, based on the concept of\nheterogeneous nearest neighbor, a GB-based approximate borderline sampling\n(GBABS) method is proposed, which is the first general sampling method capable\nof both borderline sampling and improving the quality of class noise datasets.\nAdditionally, since RD-GBG incorporates noise detection and GBABS focuses on\nborderline samples, GBABS performs outstandingly on class noise datasets\nwithout the need for an optimal purity threshold. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the GB-based sampling method\nand several representative sampling methods.

Benchmarks for assessing such agents\ndo not reflect the complexity of real-world shopping scenarios, as they often\nconsist of overly simple queries with deterministic paths, such as \"Find iPhone\n15.\" Real shopping scenarios are inherently more layered, involving\nmulti-dimensional product attributes, search filters, and user-specific sorting\npreferences. To address this gap, we introduce DeepShop, a benchmark designed\nto evaluate web agents in complex and realistic online shopping environments.\nDeepShop comprises three key components. (1) Query diversity evolution:\nStarting from real user queries, we generate diverse queries across five\npopular online shopping domains. (2) Query complexity evolution: We further\nevolve these queries to increase complexity, considering product attributes,\nsearch filters, and sorting preferences, and classify them into three levels:\neasy, medium, and hard, based on the number of evolutions. (3) Fine-grained and\nholistic evaluation: We propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses\nagent performance in terms of fine-grained aspects (product attributes, search\nfilters, and sorting preferences) and reports the overall success rate through\nholistic evaluation. We conduct a systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) methods, web agents, and deep research systems. Results show\nthat RAG struggles with complex queries due to its lack of web interaction,\nwhile other methods face significant challenges with filters and sorting\npreferences, leading to low overall success rates.

Structured matrix representations are a promising way for\nreducing the number of parameters of these models. However, it seems\nunrealistic to expect that weight matrices of pretrained models can be\naccurately represented by structured matrices without any fine-tuning. To\novercome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under\ncertain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices.

Effective federated\nrepresentations require features that are jointly informative across clients\nwhile disentangling domain-specific factors without supervision. We introduce\nFORLA, a novel framework for federated object-centric representation learning\nand feature adaptation across clients using unsupervised slot attention. At the\ncore of our method is a shared feature adapter, trained collaboratively across\nclients to adapt features from foundation models, and a shared slot attention\nmodule that learns to reconstruct the adapted features. To optimize this\nadapter, we design a two-branch student-teacher architecture. In each client, a\nstudent decoder learns to reconstruct full features from foundation models,\nwhile a teacher decoder reconstructs their adapted, low-dimensional\ncounterpart. The shared slot attention module bridges cross-domain learning by\naligning object-level representations across clients. Experiments in multiple\nreal-world datasets show that our framework not only outperforms centralized\nbaselines on object discovery but also learns a compact, universal\nrepresentation that generalizes well across domains.

Our\nanalysis covers three settings: non-random data, random model-free data, and\nparametric models (linear regression and generalized linear models).\nMethodologically, we approach both privacy and robustness based on noisy\ngradients. We ensure differential privacy via the Gaussian mechanism and\nadvanced composition, and we achieve heavy-tailed robustness using a geometric\nmedian-of-means estimator, which also sharpens the dependency on the dimension\nof the covariates.

In many cases, the human decision-maker chooses whether to\ndelegate to an AI agent based on properties of the specific instance of the\ndecision-making problem they are facing. Since humans typically lack full\nawareness of all the factors relevant to this choice for a given\ndecision-making instance, they perform a kind of categorization by treating\nindistinguishable instances -- those that have the same observable features --\nas the same. In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal\nalgorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important\ndimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that\nthe optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal\nstandalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem\nis not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial,\nand illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the\nproperties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show\nthat finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However,\nwe are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in\nseveral broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be\ndecomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm.\nFinally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an\nalgorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted\nby users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal\ndelegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u613f\u610f\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9AI\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ca\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u627e\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9AI\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "1. \u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n2. \u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u7ec4\u5408\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n3. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u3002\n4. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5f53\u6700\u4f18\u884c\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u51fd\u6570\u65f6\u3002\n5. \u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee3\u7406\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u91c7\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "- \u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u8d28\u3002\n- \u5728\u7b80\u5355\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5c5e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n- \u627e\u5230\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\n- \u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u6700\u4f18\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5f80\u5f80\u5f88\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u961f\u53cb\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u627e\u5230\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and\ncritique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.\nExtensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that\nCritique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based\nfine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general\nreasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%,\nrespectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that\nincorporates expert demonstrations within online RL.

However, these\napproaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment,\ninability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the\ndense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of\nvisual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we\npropose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding.
