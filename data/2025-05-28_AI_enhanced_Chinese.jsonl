This paper introduces Group Robust\nMulti-target Adaptive PrEtraining (GRAPE), a novel multi-source-multi-target\ndomain reweighting framework designed to calibrate pretraining data mixtures\nfor robust performance across multiple target tasks simultaneously. GRAPE\ndynamically adjusts sampling weights across source domains (domain weights)\nwhile concurrently modulating task weights that quantify the relative\nimportance of each individual target task. This adaptive process prioritizes\ntasks based on their learning difficulty throughout training. We formulate this\ninterleaved reweighting mechanism as a minimax optimization problem: The inner\nmaximization adjusts task weights leveraging group\ndistributed-robust-optimization (DRO), where those tasks demonstrating the\nleast improvement under the current data mixture are prioritized with higher\nweights; The outer minimization then optimizes domain weights to maximize loss\nreduction on the prioritized tasks. Experiments on ClimbLab and SlimPajama\ndatasets demonstrate that GRAPE consistently outperforms baseline methods in\nterms of reasoning performance across 6 benchmarks.

There are numerous methods to deal with this issue, such as\nlocal regularization, better model fusion techniques, and data sharing. Though\neffective, they lack a deep understanding of how data heterogeneity can affect\nthe global decision boundary. In this paper, we bridge this gap by performing\nan experimental analysis of the learned decision boundary using a toy example.\nOur observations are surprising: (1) we find that the existing methods suffer\nfrom forgetting and clients forget the global decision boundary and only learn\nthe perfect local one, and (2) this happens regardless of the initial weights,\nand clients forget the global decision boundary even starting from pre-trained\noptimal weights. In this paper, we present FedProj, a federated learning\nframework that robustly learns the global decision boundary and avoids its\nforgetting during local training. To achieve better ensemble knowledge fusion,\nwe design a novel server-side ensemble knowledge transfer loss to further\ncalibrate the learned global decision boundary. To alleviate the issue of\nlearned global decision boundary forgetting, we further propose leveraging an\nepisodic memory of average ensemble logits on a public unlabeled dataset to\nregulate the gradient updates at each step of local training.

A central agent\nsequentially recommends routes to travelers as origin-destination (OD) demands\narrive, to minimize total system travel time.

However, due to a lack of\ncontrollability, a single observation may yield numerous plausible but\nredundant or irrelevant hypotheses on large-scale knowledge graphs. To address\nthis limitation, we introduce the task of controllable hypothesis generation to\nimprove the practical utility of abductive reasoning. This task faces two key\nchallenges when controlling for generating long and complex logical hypotheses:\nhypothesis space collapse and hypothesis oversensitivity.

Moreover, Ctrl-DNA-generated sequences\ncapture key cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), short\nDNA motifs recognized by regulatory proteins that control gene expression,\ndemonstrating the biological plausibility of the generated sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u63a7DNA\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCtrl-DNA\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u63a7DNA\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCtrl-DNA\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u52a8\u5b50\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u6cbb\u7597\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u8c03\u63a7DNA\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9760\u7ec6\u80de\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8c03\u63a7\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u8c03\u63a7\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9650\u5236\u8131\u9776\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u52a8\u5b50\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cCtrl-DNA\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cCtrl-DNA\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6355\u83b7\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8f6c\u5f55\u56e0\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\uff08TFBS\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Ctrl-DNA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u63a7DNA\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e0a\u662f\u5408\u7406\u7684\u3002"}}

For example, if your neighbor chooses not\nto take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can\nbenefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These \"hidden\ngifts\" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others\nare hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a\nvery simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have\nindividual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if\nall the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward.\nHowever, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective\nreward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they\nuse it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents\nhave dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a \"hidden\ngift\". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including\nMARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this\nsimple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient\nagents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own\naction history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action\nhistory. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents,\ninspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning\nand helps them to converge to collective success more reliably.

Expert knowledge or\noperational data can also be incorporated to refine the model's precision and\ndiagnostic depth. In the interaction phase, users submit natural language\nqueries, which are interpreted by the LLM agent. The agent selects appropriate\ntools for structured reasoning, including upward and downward propagation\nacross the KG-DML.

This paper\nprovides a means of answering this question in the setting of binary\nclassification, which is practical and theoretically supported. We extend a\nprevious work that utilizes soft labels for estimating the Bayes error, the\noptimal error rate, in two important ways. First, we theoretically investigate\nthe properties of the bias of the hard-label-based estimator discussed in the\noriginal work. We reveal that the decay rate of the bias is adaptive to how\nwell the two class-conditional distributions are separated, and it can decay\nsignificantly faster than the previous result suggested as the number of hard\nlabels per instance grows. Second, we tackle a more challenging problem\nsetting: estimation with corrupted soft labels. One might be tempted to use\ncalibrated soft labels instead of clean ones. However, we reveal that\ncalibration guarantee is not enough, that is, even perfectly calibrated soft\nlabels can result in a substantially inaccurate estimate. Then, we show that\nisotonic calibration can provide a statistically consistent estimator under an\nassumption weaker than that of the previous work.

Recently, graph data distillation (GDD), which\nseeks to distill large graphs into compact and informative ones, has emerged as\na promising technique to enable efficient GNN training. However, most existing\nGDD works rely on heuristics that align model gradients or representation\ndistributions on condensed and original graphs, leading to compromised result\nquality, expensive training for distilling large graphs, or both. Motivated by\nthis, this paper presents an efficient and effective GDD approach, ClustGDD.\nUnder the hood, ClustGDD resorts to synthesizing the condensed graph and node\nattributes through fast and theoretically-grounded clustering that minimizes\nthe within-cluster sum of squares and maximizes the homophily on the original\ngraph.

Surprisingly, our experiments\ndemonstrate that two variants of RFA with high- and low-pass filters can\nrespectively derive informative identity and position embeddings via just one\nFFP (i.e., without any training). As a result, RFA can achieve a better\ntrade-off between quality and efficiency for both identity and position\nembedding over various baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRFA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u7684GNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u63a8\u5bfc\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRFA\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u54ea\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u4e00\u4e9b\u8017\u65f6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u800c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u4ece\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56fe\u8c31\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u80fd\u5206\u522b\u8868\u5f81\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff08RFA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u7684\u65e0\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u7684GNN\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u63a8\u5bfc\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53d7\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u5230GNN\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRFA\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u901a\u548c\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f97\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "RFA\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

This is\ndue to the training procedure employed in UVU: the online network is trained\nusing temporal difference learning with a synthetic reward derived from the\nfixed, randomly initialized target network. We provide an extensive theoretical\nanalysis of our approach using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory and show that\nin the limit of infinite network width, UVU errors are exactly equivalent to\nthe variance of an ensemble of independent universal value functions.\nEmpirically, we show that UVU achieves equal performance to large ensembles on\nchallenging multi-task offline RL settings, while offering simplicity and\nsubstantial computational savings.", "AI": {"tldr": "UVU\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u8868\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u7a33\u5065\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53c8\u4e0d\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "UVU\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u7531\u56fa\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\u5f97\u51fa\u3002UVU\u9519\u8bef\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u503c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u9047\u5230\u7684\u672a\u6765\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u5207\u7ebf\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9UVU\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u7f51\u7edc\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cUVU\u9519\u8bef\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u901a\u7528\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cUVU\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\u3002", "conclusion": "UVU\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Content analysis of\nposts and replies in online conversations is difficult because each individual\nutterance is usually short and may implicitly refer to other posts within the\nsame conversation. Thus, understanding individual posts requires capturing the\nconversational context and dependencies between different parts of a\nconversation tree and then encoding the context dependencies between posts and\ncomments/replies into the language model.\n  To this end, we propose a general-purpose mechanism to discover appropriate\nconversational context for various aspects about an online post in a\nconversation, such as whether it is informative, insightful, interesting or\nfunny. Specifically, we design two families of Conversation Kernels, which\nexplore different parts of the neighborhood of a post in the tree representing\nthe conversation and through this, build relevant conversational context that\nis appropriate for each task being considered. We apply our developed method to\nconversations crawled from slashdot.org, which allows users to apply highly\ndifferent labels to posts, such as 'insightful', 'funny', etc., and therefore\nprovides an ideal experimental platform to study whether a framework such as\nConversation Kernels is general-purpose and flexible enough to be adapted to\ndisparately different conversation understanding tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes Conversation Kernels to capture conversational context and dependencies in online conversations, improving content analysis by considering the conversation tree structure.", "motivation": "Understanding online conversations is challenging due to short utterances and implicit references.

We introduce Robust\nComputation-aware Gaussian Process (RCaGP), a novel GP model that jointly\naddresses these challenges by combining a principled treatment of\napproximation-induced uncertainty with robust generalized Bayesian updating.\nThe key insight is that robustness and approximation-awareness are not\northogonal but intertwined: approximations can exacerbate the impact of\noutliers, and mitigating one without the other is insufficient. Unlike previous\nwork that focuses narrowly on either robustness or approximation quality, RCaGP\ncombines both in a principled and scalable framework, thus effectively managing\nboth outliers and computational uncertainties introduced by approximations such\nas low-rank matrix multiplications. Our model ensures more conservative and\nreliable uncertainty estimates, a property we rigorously demonstrate.\nAdditionally, we establish a robustness property and show that the mean\nfunction is key to preserving it, motivating a tailored model selection scheme\nfor robust mean functions.

This study uses environmental and economic factors with 19\ncrops across 15 states to develop and evaluate Random Forest and SVM models\nusing 10-fold Cross Validation, Time-series Split, and Lag Variables. The\n10-fold cross validation showed high accuracy (RF: 99.96%, SVM: 94.71%) but\nraised overfitting concerns. Introducing temporal order, better reflecting\nreal-world conditions, reduced performance (RF: 78.55%, SVM: 71.18%) in the\nTime-series Split.To further increase the model accuracy while maintaining the\ntemporal order, the Lag Variables approach was employed, which resulted in\nimproved performance (RF: 83.62%, SVM: 74.38%) compared to the 10-fold cross\nvalidation approach. Overall, the models in the Time-series Split and Lag\nVariable Approaches offer practical insights by handling temporal dependencies\nand enhancing its adaptability to changing agricultural conditions over time.\nConsequently, the study shows the Random Forest model developed based on the\nLag Variables as the most preferred algorithm for optimal crop recommendation\nin the Indian context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u519c\u4e1a\u9762\u4e34\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4e0b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u5982\u4f5c\u7269\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e2e\u52a9\u519c\u6c11\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf919\u79cd\u4f5c\u7269\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff08Random Forest\uff09\u548c\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08SVM\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u6ede\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ede\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u519c\u4e1a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98df\u54c1\u751f\u4ea7\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5c31\u4e1a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u6b63\u9762\u4e34\u4f4e\u519c\u573a\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u548c\u4ea7\u91cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u56e0\u81ea\u7136\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u52a0\u5267\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u6539\u8fdb\u63aa\u65bd\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u5e76\u5e2e\u52a9\u519c\u6c11\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5370\u5ea615\u4e2a\u5dde\u768419\u79cd\u4f5c\u7269\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff08RF\uff09\u548c\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08SVM\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u91c7\u752810\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6ede\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "10\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08RF: 99.96%\uff0cSVM: 94.71%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u540e\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\uff08RF: 78.55%\uff0cSVM: 71.18%\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6ede\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08RF: 83.62%\uff0cSVM: 74.38%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6ede\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u519c\u4e1a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ede\u540e\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u786e\u5b9a\u4e3a\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4f5c\u7269\u63a8\u8350\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose\na Test-Time Learning (TTL) paradigm for LLMs, namely TLM, which dynamically\nadapts LLMs to target domains using only unlabeled test data during testing.\nSpecifically, we first provide empirical evidence and theoretical insights to\nreveal that more accurate predictions from LLMs can be achieved by minimizing\nthe input perplexity of the unlabeled test data. Based on this insight, we\nformulate the Test-Time Learning process of LLMs as input perplexity\nminimization, enabling self-supervised enhancement of LLM performance.\nFurthermore, we observe that high-perplexity samples tend to be more\ninformative for model optimization. Accordingly, we introduce a Sample\nEfficient Learning Strategy that actively selects and emphasizes these\nhigh-perplexity samples for test-time updates. Lastly, to mitigate catastrophic\nforgetting and ensure adaptation stability, we adopt Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\ninstead of full-parameter optimization, which allows lightweight model updates\nwhile preserving more original knowledge from the model.

Although multiple safety alignment strategies\nhave been proposed to prevent harmful outputs, they often lead to overly\ncautious behavior -- rejecting even benign prompts -- a phenomenon known as\n$\\textit{over-refusal}$ that reduces the practical utility of T2I models.\nDespite over-refusal having been observed in practice, there is no large-scale\nbenchmark that systematically evaluates this phenomenon for T2I models. In this\npaper, we present an automatic workflow to construct synthetic evaluation data,\nresulting in OVERT ($\\textbf{OVE}$r-$\\textbf{R}$efusal evaluation on\n$\\textbf{T}$ext-to-image models), the first large-scale benchmark for assessing\nover-refusal behaviors in T2I models. OVERT includes 4,600 seemingly harmful\nbut benign prompts across nine safety-related categories, along with 1,785\ngenuinely harmful prompts (OVERT-unsafe) to evaluate the safety-utility\ntrade-off. Using OVERT, we evaluate several leading T2I models and find that\nover-refusal is a widespread issue across various categories (Figure 1),\nunderscoring the need for further research to enhance the safety alignment of\nT2I models without compromising their functionality.As a preliminary attempt to\nreduce over-refusal, we explore prompt rewriting; however, we find it often\ncompromises faithfulness to the meaning of the original prompts.

In this work, we introduce this\npondering process into language models by repeatedly invoking the forward\nprocess within a single token generation step. During pondering, instead of\ngenerating an actual token sampled from the prediction distribution, the model\nponders by yielding a weighted sum of all token embeddings according to the\npredicted token distribution. The generated embedding is then fed back as input\nfor another forward pass. We show that the model can learn to ponder in this\nway through self-supervised learning, without any human annotations. Our method\nis straightforward and can be seamlessly integrated with various existing\nlanguage models. Experiments across three widely used open-source\narchitectures-GPT-2, Pythia, and LLaMA-and extensive downstream task\nevaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. For\nlanguage modeling tasks, pondering language models achieve performance\ncomparable to vanilla models with twice the number of parameters.

However, despite their creative potential, T2I\nmodels often replicate and amplify societal stereotypes -- particularly those\nrelated to gender, race, and culture -- raising important ethical concerns.\nThis paper proposes a theory-driven bias detection rubric and a Social\nStereotype Index (SSI) to systematically evaluate social biases in T2I outputs.\nWe audited three major T2I model outputs -- DALL-E-3, Midjourney-6.1, and\nStability AI Core -- using 100 queries across three categories -- geocultural,\noccupational, and adjectival. Our analysis reveals that initial outputs are\nprone to include stereotypical visual cues, including gendered professions,\ncultural markers, and western beauty norms. To address this, we adopted our\nrubric to conduct targeted prompt refinement using LLMs, which significantly\nreduced bias -- SSI dropped by 61% for geocultural, 69% for occupational, and\n51% for adjectival queries.

Conversational contextual bandits, a prevalent approach in\nthis domain, aim to optimize preference learning by balancing exploitation and\nexploration. However, several limitations hinder their effectiveness in\nreal-world scenarios. First, existing algorithms employ key term selection\nstrategies with insufficient exploration, often failing to thoroughly probe\nusers' preferences and resulting in suboptimal preference estimation. Second,\ncurrent algorithms typically rely on deterministic rules to initiate\nconversations, causing unnecessary interactions when preferences are\nwell-understood and missed opportunities when preferences are uncertain. To\naddress these limitations, we propose three novel algorithms: CLiSK, CLiME, and\nCLiSK-ME. CLiSK introduces smoothed key term contexts to enhance exploration in\npreference learning, CLiME adaptively initiates conversations based on\npreference uncertainty, and CLiSK-ME integrates both techniques. We\ntheoretically prove that all three algorithms achieve a tighter regret upper\nbound of $O(\\sqrt{dT\\log{T}})$ with respect to the time horizon $T$, improving\nupon existing methods. Additionally, we provide a matching lower bound\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{dT})$ for conversational bandits, demonstrating that our\nalgorithms are nearly minimax optimal.

To this end, we propose Square$\\chi$PO, a simple\none-line change to $\\chi$PO where the standard log-loss is replaced by a new\nsquare loss over probability. Thanks to the inherent properties of this new\nloss, we have advanced the state-of-the-art of differentially private and\nrobust offline direct alignment. Specifically, for the local model of label\nprivacy, Square$\\chi$PO is the first algorithm that attains an optimal rate\nbased on single-policy concentrability even with general function\napproximations. It also gives the first result under the central model of\nprivacy protection over both prompts (responses) and labels. On the robustness\nside against Huber label corruption, Square$\\chi$PO is the first alignment\nmethod that has a meaningful theoretical guarantee under general function\napproximations. More importantly, Square$\\chi$PO can address privacy protection\nand corruption simultaneously, where an interesting separation is observed,\nimplying that the order of privacy and corruption matters. Furthermore, we show\nthat Square$\\chi$PO can also be easily extended to handle the scenario of the\ngeneral preference model with state-of-the-art guarantees under corruption and\nprivacy.

To address this limitation, we\npropose a hybrid approach that combines TF-IDF with BERT embeddings,\neffectively transforming Spanish text into rich numerical representations that\npreserve the semantic depth of the original language by using a Custom Stacking\nEnsemble (CSE) approach. To evaluate emotion classification, we utilize a range\nof models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, Bagging classifier with LGBM,\nand AdaBoost. The CSE model combines these classifiers as base models and uses\na one-vs-all Logistic Regression as the meta-model. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that CSE significantly outperforms the individual and BERT model,\nachieving a test accuracy of 93.3% on the native Spanish dataset--higher than\nthe accuracy obtained from the translated version. These findings underscore\nthe challenges of emotion classification in Spanish and highlight the\nadvantages of combining vectorization techniques like TF-IDF with BERT for\nimproved accuracy.

Inspired by the\nDual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA\ntask that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within\na strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial\nresponse; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more\ndeliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the\nprevious stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy\nfrom 24.9% to 27.9% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 49.8% for\nDeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone\nachieves 26.8% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial\ninference efficiency gains.

Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling\nparadigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based\none used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior,\nwhich induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and\ntarget data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls\nto the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned\nDistribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for\ntraining FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior\ndistribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing\nthe ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow\nenables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These\npaths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image\ngeneration at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)\ntransformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained\non a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably\noutperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly\non pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the\ncorresponding pixel-space baseline.

However, a critical challenge when applying RL to\nthese agentic tasks arises from delayed rewards: feedback signals are typically\navailable only after the entire task is completed. This makes it non-trivial to\nassign delayed rewards to earlier actions, providing insufficient guidance\nregarding environmental constraints and hindering agent training. In this work,\nwe draw on the insight that the ultimate completion of a task emerges from the\ncumulative progress an agent makes across individual steps. We propose Stepwise\nProgress Attribution (SPA), a general reward redistribution framework that\ndecomposes the final reward into stepwise contributions, each reflecting its\nincremental progress toward overall task completion. To achieve this, we train\na progress estimator that accumulates stepwise contributions over a trajectory\nto match the task completion. During policy optimization, we combine the\nestimated per-step contribution with a grounding signal for actions executed in\nthe environment as the fine-grained, intermediate reward for effective agent\ntraining.

We provide a theoretical\nguarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an\nexponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion.\nExperiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement\nin mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to\nstate-of-the-art OPE methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "STITCH-OPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u62fc\u63a5\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08OPE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u6307\u6570\u7206\u70b8\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSTITCH-OPE\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6280\u672f\u3002\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002STITCH-OPE\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u51cf\u53bb\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u62fc\u63a5\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fee\u6539\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u8f68\u8ff9\u6269\u6563\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728D4RL\u548cOpenAI Gym\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684OPE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSTITCH-OPE\u5728\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u540e\u6094\u503c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "STITCH-OPE\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u548c\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684OPE\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We further formulate the task as a variation of the\nranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies\neach agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the\nduration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and\n(iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model,\nTopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom\naggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data\nand adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our\nmodel against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning\nmethods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and\nsynthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves\nsuperior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering\nimproved interpretability through its structured output.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents TopSpreadersNetwork, a novel graph neural network model designed to identify super-spreaders in multilayer networks.

However, users can only\npassively receive social predictions without being able to choose the\nunderlying algorithm, which limits personalization. Fortunately, with the\nemergence of blockchain, users are allowed to choose algorithms that are\ntailored to their local situation, improving prediction results in a\npersonalized way. In a blockchain environment, each user possesses its own\nmodel to perform the social prediction, capturing different perspectives on\nsocial interactions. In our work, we propose DeSocial, a decentralized social\nnetwork learning framework deployed on an Ethereum (ETH) local development\nchain that integrates distributed data storage, node-level consensus, and\nuser-driven model selection through Ganache. In the first stage, each user\nleverages DeSocial to evaluate multiple backbone models on their local\nsubgraph. DeSocial coordinates the execution and returns model-wise prediction\nresults, enabling the user to select the most suitable backbone for\npersonalized social prediction.
