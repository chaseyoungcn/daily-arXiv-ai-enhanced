Here, we draw a connection between these two classes of models and\nshow that certain design decisions (latent variable choice, conditioning\nmethod, etc.) in the DA framework -- leading to a model we term DMZ -- allow us\nto obtain the best of both worlds: effective representations as evaluated on\ndownstream tasks, including domain transfer, as well as more efficient\nmodelling and generation with fewer denoising steps compared to standard DMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffusion autoencoders (DAs) are improved by creating a model (DMZ) that combines the benefits of DAs and diffusion models that learn their forward process, resulting in better representations and more efficient generation.", "motivation": "To enhance the generative performance of Diffusion autoencoders (DAs) by effectively modeling and sampling latent variables, while also improving representation capabilities for downstream tasks such as classification, controllable generation, and interpolation.", "method": "By drawing connections between DAs and diffusion models that learn their forward process, specific design choices (like latent variable choice and conditioning method) within the DA framework lead to the creation of the DMZ model.", "result": "The DMZ model achieves effective representations for downstream tasks, including domain transfer, and allows for more efficient modeling and generation with fewer denoising steps compared to standard diffusion models.", "conclusion": "The DMZ model successfully integrates advantages from both DAs and diffusion models that learn their forward process, offering enhanced representation capabilities and more efficient generation."}}

To\naddress these concerns, unlearning techniques have been developed to remove the\ninfluence of specific data without retraining from scratch. However, this paper\nreveals a critical vulnerability in fine-tuning-based unlearning: a malicious\nuser can craft a manipulated forgetting request that stealthily degrades the\nmodel's utility for benign users. We demonstrate this risk through a\nred-teaming Stealthy Attack (SA), which is inspired by two key limitations of\nexisting unlearning (the inability to constrain the scope of unlearning effect\nand the failure to distinguish benign tokens from unlearning signals). Prior\nwork has shown that unlearned models tend to memorize forgetting data as\nunlearning signals, and respond with hallucinations or feigned ignorance when\nunlearning signals appear in the input. By subtly increasing the presence of\ncommon benign tokens in the forgetting data, SA enhances the connection between\nbenign tokens and unlearning signals. As a result, when normal users include\nsuch tokens in their prompts, the model exhibits unlearning behaviors, leading\nto unintended utility degradation. To address this vulnerability, we propose\nScope-aware Unlearning (SU), a lightweight enhancement that introduces a scope\nterm into the unlearning objective, encouraging the model to localize the\nforgetting effect. Our method requires no additional data processing,\nintegrates seamlessly with existing fine-tuning frameworks, and significantly\nimproves robustness against SA.

Direct preference optimization methods, like SimPO, are not\ndesigned to handle these localized differences and turn out to be ineffective.\nWe address this with a new localized preference optimization algorithm that\nmasks the security related tokens in both the winning (secure) and losing\n(insecure) responses. To prevent loss in code quality, we also add a\nregularizer. Evaluations show that both training on our dataset, DiSCo, and the\nnew preference optimization algorithm, LPO, yield substantial reductions in\ncode insecurity while also improving overall code quality.

In this paper, we propose a\ndenoising technique DeGLIF: Denoising Graph Data using Leave-One-Out Influence\nFunction. DeGLIF uses a small set of clean data and the leave-one-out influence\nfunction to make label noise robust node-level prediction on graph data.\nLeave-one-out influence function approximates the change in the model\nparameters if a training point is removed from the training dataset. Recent\nadvances propose a way to calculate the leave-one-out influence function for\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs). We extend that recent work to estimate the change\nin validation loss, if a training node is removed from the training dataset. We\nuse this estimate and a new theoretically motivated relabelling function to\ndenoise the training dataset. We propose two DeGLIF variants to identify noisy\nnodes. Both these variants do not require any information about the noise model\nor the noise level in the dataset; DeGLIF also does not estimate these\nquantities.

A critical, yet understudied, issue is the\npotential divergence between an LLM's stated preferences (its reported\nalignment with general principles) and its revealed preferences (inferred from\ndecisions in contextualized scenarios). Such deviations raise fundamental\nconcerns for the interpretability, trustworthiness, reasoning transparency, and\nethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. This work\nformally defines and proposes a method to measure this preference deviation. We\ninvestigate how LLMs may activate different guiding principles in specific\ncontexts, leading to choices that diverge from previously stated general\nprinciples. Our approach involves crafting a rich dataset of well-designed\nprompts as a series of forced binary choices and presenting them to LLMs. We\ncompare LLM responses to general principle prompts stated preference with LLM\nresponses to contextualized prompts revealed preference, using metrics like KL\ndivergence to quantify the deviation. We repeat the analysis across different\ncategories of preferences and on four mainstream LLMs and find that a minor\nchange in prompt format can often pivot the preferred choice regardless of the\npreference categories and LLMs in the test. This prevalent phenomenon\nhighlights the lack of understanding and control of the LLM decision-making\ncompetence. Our study will be crucial for integrating LLMs into services,\nespecially those that interact directly with humans, where morality, fairness,\nand social responsibilities are crucial dimensions. Furthermore, identifying or\nbeing aware of such deviation will be critically important as LLMs are\nincreasingly envisioned for autonomous agentic tasks where continuous human\nevaluation of all LLMs' intermediary decision-making steps is impossible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd1\u671f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5c06\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6d4b\u91cfLLMs\u4e2d\u58f0\u660e\u504f\u597d\u548c\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u7b26\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u683c\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8LLMs\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c06LLMs\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cLLMs\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u58f0\u660e\u504f\u597d\uff08\u5373\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u4e0e\u666e\u904d\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u548c\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\uff08\u4ece\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9LLMs\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b26\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u7b26\u4ee5\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5f3a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\u7ed9LLMs\u3002\u7136\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83LLMs\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u539f\u5219\u63d0\u793a\u7b26\uff08\u58f0\u660e\u504f\u597d\uff09\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7b26\uff08\u63ed\u793a\u504f\u597d\uff09\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5982KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u4e0a\u91cd\u590d\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684LLMs\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7b26\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u5f80\u5f80\u4e5f\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u9996\u9009\u9879\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5bf9LLMs\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5c06LLMs\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u65f6\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u6b64\u7c7b\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u63a5\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e14\u9053\u5fb7\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8d23\u4efb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u8bbe\u60f3LLMs\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u4e5f\u5c06\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u6240\u6709LLMs\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u51b3\u7b56\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

However, current\nfederated learning (FL) approaches are primarily designed for dense models,\nmaking them unable to directly exploit the sparsity inherent in MoE\narchitectures. Treating MoE models as dense networks in federated scenarios\nresults in excessive communication overhead and computational costs,\nundermining the potential for personalized knowledge sharing. To address these\nchallenges, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel\nfederated learning framework explicitly tailored for MoE-based LLMs. FLEx\nefficiently personalizes by pruning the global MoE model to keep only one\nexpert per client, and employs an adaptive gating mechanism to reintegrate\nthese personalized experts into the pre-trained MoE layers, ensuring the\noriginal backbone architecture remains unchanged.

While contemporary graph-based detection\nmethods demonstrate promising results, their practical application is limited\nby label reliance and poor generalization capability across diverse\ncommunities. Generative Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSL) presents a\npromising paradigm to overcome these limitations, yet existing approaches\npredominantly follow the homophily assumption and fail to capture the global\npatterns in the graph, which potentially diminishes their effectiveness when\nfacing the challenges of interaction camouflage and distributed deployment in\nbot detection scenarios. To this end, we propose BotHP, a generative GSL\nframework tailored to boost graph-based bot detectors through heterophily-aware\nrepresentation learning and prototype-guided cluster discovery.

A recent work\nintroduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first\ndemonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian\ndistributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash\ncan reduce parameters by up to 90\\% with minimal performance loss. Building on\nthis foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM\noptimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1)\nGG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of\ntrained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2)\nDeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight\ndistributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized\ndegradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit\nfloating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash\ntraining, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy.\nExperiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework\nconsistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard\ntraining baselines.

Hypothesis selection addresses the setting where, in\naddition to a sample set, we are given $n$ candidate distributions -- referred\nto as hypotheses -- and the goal is to determine which one best describes the\nunderlying data distribution. This problem is known to be solvable very\nefficiently, requiring roughly $O(\\log n)$ samples and running in\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$ time. The quality of the output is measured via the total\nvariation distance to the unknown distribution, and the approximation factor of\nthe algorithm determines how large this distance is compared to the optimal\ndistance achieved by the best candidate hypothesis.

However, selecting a data mixture that\nachieves strong performance across all tasks is challenging. Existing\napproaches rely on large ablation studies, heuristics, or human intuition, but\nthese can be prohibitively expensive and suboptimal. We study this problem in\nthe setting of preference optimization via DPO and introduce AutoMixAlign\n(AMA), a theoretically-grounded algorithm that adaptively mixes datasets during\ntraining to balance performance across tasks. AMA first trains\n\\textit{specialist models} for each task to determine losses that correspond to\nstrong task performance. Then, it trains a generalist model using a novel\nminimax optimization that prioritizes tasks for which generalist model losses\ndeviate most from specialist model losses. To optimize this problem, we propose\ntwo algorithms: (1) AMA-R, which adaptively reweights the objective to\nprioritize tasks, and (2) AMA-S, which adaptively adjusts how much data is\nsampled from each task to prioritize tasks. Both algorithms achieve a\nconvergence rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ in the convex case. AMA-R's convergence\nresult follows from Sagawa et al.

QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization\n(DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales\nnormalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty,\nmitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions.\nTrained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains,\nwe show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on\naverage across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training\nmethods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation\ndata, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an\nIoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI\no4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the\nfull model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all\nintermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.", "AI": {"tldr": "QoQ-Med-7B/32B\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO)\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7efc\u5408\u5904\u7406\u533b\u7597\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u6587\u672c\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e8643%\uff08\u4ee5macro-F1\u8861\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u7a81\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5176IoU\u6bd4\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u9ad810\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230OpenAI o4-mini\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u653e\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u4ee5\u53ca\u6240\u6709\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4ee5\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5404\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4e3a\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u6587\u672c\u62a5\u544a\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86QoQ-Med-7B/32B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO)\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u9886\u57df\u7a00\u6709\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u7f29\u653e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6db5\u76d69\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9886\u57df\u7684261\u4e07\u6761\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u65e0\u6279\u8bc4\u5bb6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GRPO\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7fQoQ-Med\u5728\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e8643%\uff08\u4ee5macro-F1\u8861\u91cf\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0cQoQ-Med\u80fd\u591f\u7a81\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5176IoU\u6bd4\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u51fa10\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86OpenAI o4-mini\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "QoQ-Med-7B/32B\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u6587\u672c\u62a5\u544a\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7DRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u653e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

By\nproactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or\nharmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with\ndeploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the\nappearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or\nregulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a\nspecific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT\npresentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes\nobfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the\nundesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT\nmonitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization\nto latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide\nan extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of\nspecific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to\nsubstitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying\nmethod by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can\nlearn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that\nmodels can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to\nan overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in\ntraining, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the\nclass which it can apply to held-out testing strings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5a01\u80c1\u5230CoT\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u60e9\u7f5a\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e00\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4e2d\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u505a\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cdCoT\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8fdb\u884c\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7801\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e00\u7c7b\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5f62\u6210\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u5230\u60e9\u7f5a\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u66ff\u4ee3\u88ab\u7981\u6b62\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6839\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u66ff\u6362\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4f1a\u9690\u5199\u672f\u822c\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u66f4\u9690\u853d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u52a0\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3002"}}

To\nmitigate the impact of low-quality data, we identify optimization opportunities\nin hardware generation tasks, using user-defined metrics for model aggregation.\nThe second stage focuses on client personalization to enhance both speed and\nquality.

In light of this, we introduce an\nefficient and theoretically grounded projection matrix that is isometric,\nenabling global parameter sharing and reducing computation overhead.\nFurthermore, under the unified view of Uni-LoRA, this design requires only a\nsingle trainable vector to reconstruct LoRA parameters for the entire LLM -\nmaking Uni-LoRA both a unified framework and a \"one-vector-only\" solution.\nExtensive experiments on GLUE, mathematical reasoning, and instruction tuning\nbenchmarks demonstrate that Uni-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art parameter\nefficiency while outperforming or matching prior approaches in predictive\nperformance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However,\nits application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation\ncosts through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems\nfrom the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data,\nwhereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models\nare often unavailable. In this paper, we introduce ActiveKD, a framework that\nintegrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of\nlarge vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured\nprediction bias of VLMs -- i.e., their predictions form clusters in the\nprobability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher\nmodel, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning.\nTo exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection\nstrategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the\nfeature space. PCoreSet strategically selects categorically diverse unlabeled\nsamples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under\nlimited annotation budgets.

Learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative, and\namong them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their excellent\nperformance in solving power control problems. However, all existing GNN-based\napproaches assume ideal orthogonality among pilot sequences for user equipments\n(UEs), which is unrealistic given that the number of UEs exceeds the available\northogonal pilot sequences in CFmMIMO schemes. Moreover, most learning-based\nmethods assume a fixed number of UEs, whereas the number of active UEs varies\nover time in practice.

Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high\ncost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations\nand exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate\nprecision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning\ncan accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology\nslides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly\nto early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled\nPathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation\nsequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central\nSouth University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links\nwhole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and\ntumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology\nimages to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early\ngenetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets,\nwe provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in\nPathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We\nbenchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation,\nsubtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks.

Traditional algorithms, which are typically\ndesigned to optimize average performance, often overlook the intrinsic\ndiversity within datasets. This oversight can lead to a myriad of issues,\nincluding unreliable decision-making, inadequate generalization across\ndifferent domains, unfair outcomes, and false scientific inferences. Hence, a\nnuanced approach to modeling data heterogeneity is essential for the\ndevelopment of dependable, data-driven systems. In this survey paper, we\npresent a thorough exploration of heterogeneity-aware machine learning, a\nparadigm that systematically integrates considerations of data heterogeneity\nthroughout the entire ML pipeline -- from data collection and model training to\nmodel evaluation and deployment.

This is done either in the primal or dual space\nto obtain valid upper and lower bounds on the Wasserstein metric of the\nfull-resolution inputs.

Existing approaches typically divide the data into time bins,\nextract network features within each bin, and then compare these features over\ntime. This introduces an inherent tradeoff between temporal resolution and the\nstatistical stability of the extracted features. Despite this tradeoff,\nreminiscent of time-frequency tradeoffs in signal processing, most methods rely\non a fixed temporal resolution. Choosing an appropriate resolution parameter is\ntypically difficult and can be especially problematic in domains like\ncybersecurity, where anomalous behavior may emerge at multiple time scales. We\naddress this challenge by proposing ANIE (Adaptive Network Intensity\nEstimation), a multi-resolution framework designed to automatically identify\nthe time scales at which network structure evolves, enabling the joint\ndetection of both rapid and gradual changes. Modeling interactions as Poisson\nprocesses, our method proceeds in two steps: (1) estimating a low-dimensional\nsubspace of node behavior, and (2) deriving a set of novel empirical affinity\ncoefficients that quantify change in interaction intensity between latent\nfactors and support statistical testing for structural change across time\nscales. We provide theoretical guarantees for subspace estimation and the\nasymptotic behavior of the affinity coefficients, enabling model-based change\ndetection. Experiments on synthetic networks show that ANIE adapts to the\nappropriate time resolution and is able to capture sharp structural changes\nwhile remaining robust to noise.

By\nquantifying the energy usage associated with both uncompressed and compressed\nmodels, we investigate compression as a means of reducing electricity\nconsumption. We consider nine different pre-trained models, ranging in size\nfrom 8M parameters to 138M parameters.

We leverage this insight to\nguide on-manifold sampling using perceptual features and input measurements.\nSpecifically, we propose Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG), an algorithm that\nutilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to\nobtain perceptually consistent multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from\nthe denoising U-Net. We empirically demonstrate that these hyperfeatures\nexhibit high correlation with human perception in IQA tasks.

To improve training efficiency and reduce\ndata redundancy, recent works use LLM-based scoring functions, e.g.,\nInstruction-Following Difficulty (IFD), to select high-quality\ninstruction-tuning data with scores above a threshold. While these data\nselection methods often lead to models that can match or even exceed the\nperformance of models trained on the full datasets, we identify two key\nlimitations: (i) they assess quality at the sample level, ignoring token-level\ninformativeness; and (ii) they overlook the robustness of the scoring method,\noften selecting a sample due to superficial lexical features instead of its\ntrue quality.

By\nachieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural\ncompilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to\ntransform the landscape of compiler optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff08REASONING COMPILER\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u7a7a\u95f4\u975e\u5e38\u5927\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u968f\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7f16\u8bd1\u51b3\u7b56\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aREASONING COMPILER\u7684\u65b0\u7f16\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7531\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u6307\u5bfc\u3002LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u6848\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u7a0b\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u51fa\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u3002MCTS\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7f16\u8bd1\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u7684\u904d\u5386\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u683c\u5c40\u3002"}}

So far,\nefforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on\nimage-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions,\nplacing emphasis on the \"eyes\" of human perception while neglecting the \"ears\",\nnamely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static\ninteractions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally\nincorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of\nsimultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been\nexplored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific\nconstraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural\nconversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots\nwith \"eyes and ears\" capable of more immersive interactions with humans.

The ADGL module adopts a comprehensive social interaction strategy,\nleveraging an affinity-enhanced global drug-target graph to learn both global\nDTI and the individual similarity information of drugs and targets. In\ncontrast, the EDGL module employs a higher-order social interaction strategy,\namplifying the influence of even-hop neighbors through an even-polynomial graph\nfilter grounded in balance theory, enabling the indirect mining of higher-order\nhomogeneous information.

Classical signal processing based approaches, such as\nminimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order\nstatistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural\nnetworks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often\nsuffer from high complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE\n(A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter\nvia the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel\nthrough a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear\nactivations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To\nenhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention\nencoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure.\nAdditionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible\ntrade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive\nsimulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE\nconsistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE\nacross a wide range of SNR conditions.

Given the\nhigh costs associated with hiring or training professional lighting engineers,\nAutomatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has gained increasing attention.\nHowever, most existing approaches only classify music into limited categories\nand map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and\nmonotonous outcomes that lack rationality.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to\nconceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification\nproblem. Our method modifies the BART model to take audio music as input and\nproduce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip\nconnection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within\nthe frame grid.We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an\nhuman evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional\nrule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap\ncompared to real lighting engineers.Specifically, our method yields a p-value\nof 0.72 in a statistical comparison based on human evaluations with human\nlighting engineers, suggesting that the proposed approach closely matches human\nlighting engineering performance.

Introduces a horizontal LDA search framework for\n  relationally navigating fairness-accuracy trade-offs using 2021 HMDA data", "summary": "As machine learning models are increasingly embedded into society through\nhigh-stakes decision-making, selecting the right algorithm for a given task,\naudience, and sector presents a critical challenge, particularly in the context\nof fairness. Traditional assessments of model fairness have often framed\nfairness as an objective mathematical property, treating model selection as an\noptimization problem under idealized informational conditions. This overlooks\nmodel multiplicity as a consideration--that multiple models can deliver similar\nperformance while exhibiting different fairness characteristics. Legal scholars\nhave engaged this challenge through the concept of Less Discriminatory\nAlgorithms (LDAs), which frames model selection as a civil rights obligation.\nIn real-world deployment, this normative challenge is bounded by constraints on\nfairness experimentation, e.g., regulatory standards, institutional priorities,\nand resource capacity.\n  Against these considerations, the paper revisits Lee and Floridi (2021)'s\nrelational fairness approach using updated 2021 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act\n(HMDA) data, and proposes an expansion of the scope of the LDA search process.\nWe argue that extending the LDA search horizontally, considering fairness\nacross model families themselves, provides a lightweight complement, or\nalternative, to within-model hyperparameter optimization, when operationalizing\nfairness in non-experimental, resource constrained settings.

In this work, we investigate\nWorld-model-based Policy Evaluation (WPE). We first train an action-conditioned\nvideo generation model as a proxy to real-world environments. To enable\nefficient rollouts of hundreds of interactive steps while mitigating error\naccumulation in the world model, we propose an inference scheme which we call\nBlockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer with adjustable context and\ndecoding horizon lengths.

Nevertheless, WPE preserves the\nrelative rankings of different policies.

Extending text-to-image\ngeneration to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant\nchallenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the\nabsence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical\nimaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation\nthat combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language\npretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model\ntrained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared\nembedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT\nvolumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained\nvolumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring\nexternal super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the\nCT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity,\nclinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive\nperformance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for\ntext-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by\nour framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream\ndiagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific\nvision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image\ngeneration. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion,\nour method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing\nclinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications\nin data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e3D\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u65b0\u578bText-to-CT\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728CT-RATE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5408\u6210CT\u626b\u63cf\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u57282D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\uff08\u5982\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\uff09\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f3a\u5927\u6846\u67b6\u76843D CT\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Text-to-CT\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668CLIP\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u7684CT\u4f53\u79ef\u548c\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u5171\u4eab\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u4f53\u79efVAE\u5c06CT\u4f53\u79ef\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u76843D\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728CT-RATE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230CT\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5408\u6210\u7684CT\u626b\u63cf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684CT\u4f53\u79ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u62df\u7b49\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, in\ncurrent ControlNet training, each control is designed to influence all areas of\nan image, which can lead to conflicts when different control signals are\nexpected to manage different parts of the image in practical applications. This\nissue is especially pronounced with edge-type control conditions, where regions\nlacking boundary information often represent low-frequency signals, referred to\nas silent control signals. When combining multiple ControlNets, these silent\ncontrol signals can suppress the generation of textures in related areas,\nresulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose Minimal\nImpact ControlNet. Our approach mitigates conflicts through three key\nstrategies: constructing a balanced dataset, combining and injecting feature\nsignals in a balanced manner, and addressing the asymmetry in the score\nfunction's Jacobian matrix induced by ControlNet. These improvements enhance\nthe compatibility of control signals, allowing for freer and more harmonious\ngeneration in areas with silent control signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMinimal Impact ControlNet\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2aControlNets\u65f6\u7531\u4e8e\u9759\u9ed8\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u6ce8\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406ControlNet\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u81ea\u7531\u548c\u8c10\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dControlNet\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6240\u6709\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u4e0d\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u9700\u8981\u7ba1\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fb9\u7f18\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u533a\u57df\u901a\u5e38\u4ee3\u8868\u4f4e\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5373\u9759\u9ed8\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2aControlNets\u65f6\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Minimal Impact ControlNet\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2\uff09\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u6ce8\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b3\uff09\u5904\u7406\u7531ControlNet\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684ControlNet\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5177\u6709\u9759\u9ed8\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u533a\u57df\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u81ea\u7531\u548c\u8c10\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "Minimal Impact ControlNet\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591aControlNet\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u9759\u9ed8\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002"}}

Our evaluation of 27 open-source\nand proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model\nachieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify\nall correct answers.

This issue,\noften manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes,\nlimits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we\npropose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain\nExplanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the\nreasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and\nprocesses. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic\nrelation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate\nattribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At\ninference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable\nscenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting\nplausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design\nenables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern.\nThrough extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that\nKG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6%\nand F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1%\nin F1 on CWQ.

This study evaluates\nnine large language models (LLMs) in augmenting a methodless UML diagram (21\nclasses, 17 relationships) using 21 structured waste-management use cases. A\ntotal of 90 diagrams (3,373 methods) were assessed across six metrics: method\nquantity, signature richness (visibility, names, parameters, return types),\nannotation completeness (linking to use cases/actions), structural fidelity,\nsyntactic correctness (PlantUML compilation), and naming convergence (across\nmodels). All LLMs produced valid PlantUML diagrams adhering to UML conventions.\nSome models excelled in method coverage and annotation accuracy, while others\nshowed richer parameterization but weaker traceability. These results\ndemonstrate that LLMs can generate well-structured methods with consistent\nnaming, advancing automated behavioral modeling. However, inconsistencies in\nannotations and signatures highlight the need for improved prompt engineering\nand model selection. The rapid generation of these methods supports Agile\npractices by enabling faster design iterations.

Meanwhile,\nphysics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world\nunderstanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper\nintroduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems\nspanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue.\nSpecifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through\na carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics\ndomains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern\nPhysics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to\ngraduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and\nevaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset\ninto training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful\nreasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In\naddition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks\nexhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in\nphysics domain.

However, given the inherently\nchaotic nature of our system, this assumption is complicated by sensitive\ndependence, where small uncertainties in initial conditions can lead to\nexponentially diverging outcomes over time. This challenge is particularly\nsalient at global spatial scales and over centennial timescales, where data\ngaps are not just common but expected. The source of uncertainty is two-fold:\n(1) sparse, noisy observations from satellites and ground stations, and (2)\ninternal variability stemming from the simplifying approximations within the\nmodels themselves.\n  In practice, data assimilation methods are used to reconcile this missing\ninformation by conditioning model states on partial observations. Our work\nbuilds on this idea but operates at the extreme end of sparsity. We propose a\nconditional data imputation framework that reconstructs full temperature fields\nfrom as little as 1% observational coverage.

Understanding\ngeneralization error behavior of increasingly large-scale machine learning\nmodels remains a significant area of investigation, as conventional analyses\noften link error bounds to model complexity, failing to fully explain the\nsuccess of extremely large architectures. This research introduces a novel\nperspective by establishing a model-independent upper bound for generalization\nerror applicable to algorithms whose outputs are determined solely by the\ndata's histogram, such as empirical risk minimization or gradient-based\nmethods. Crucially, this bound is shown to depend only on the R\\'enyi entropy\nof the data-generating distribution, suggesting that a small generalization\nerror can be maintained even with arbitrarily large models, provided the data\nquantity is sufficient relative to this entropy. This framework offers a direct\nexplanation for the phenomenon where generalization performance degrades\nsignificantly upon injecting random noise into data, where the performance\ndegrade is attributed to the consequent increase in the data distribution's\nR\\'enyi entropy.

Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP\nachieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical\nefficiency for real-time applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d7GPT-4o\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5bf9\u4f7f\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u6d41\u7545\u7684\u53e3\u8bed\u4e92\u52a8\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u58f0\u9053\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP)\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cc\u58f0\u9053\u53e3\u8bed\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNTPP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86SLMs\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u4f7f\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u6d41\u7545\u7684\u53e3\u8bed\u4e92\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u58f0\u9053\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP)\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u53cc\u58f0\u9053\u53e3\u8bed\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5NTPP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86SLMs\u5728\u8f6e\u6b21\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cNTPP\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "NTPP\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u58f0\u9053\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86SLMs\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

In particular, for cutting plane selection two score functions have\nbeen proposed in the literature to evaluate the quality of a cut:\nbranch-and-cut tree size and gap closed. In this paper, we present new sample\ncomplexity lower bounds, valid for both scores. We show that for a wide family\nof classes $\\mathcal{F}$ that maps an instance to a cut, learning over an\nunknown distribution of the instances to minimize those scores requires at\nleast (up to multiplicative constants) as many samples as learning from the\nsame class function $\\mathcal{F}$ any generic target function (using square\nloss). Our results also extend to the case of learning from a restricted set of\ncuts, namely those from the Simplex tableau. To the best of our knowledge,\nthese constitute the first lower bounds for the learning-to-cut framework. We\ncompare our bounds to known upper bounds in the case of neural networks and\nshow they are nearly tight. We illustrate our results with a graph neural\nnetwork selection evaluated on set covering and facility location integer\nprogramming models and we empirically show that the gap closed score is an\neffective proxy to minimize the branch-and-cut tree size.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that\nguides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features\nlearned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data.\nSpecifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on\nCUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse\ndomains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the\nTCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on\nfactual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism.\nTo fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs\non TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety.

Large language models (LLMs) could\nsupport crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive\ncontexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540\nannotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline,\nassessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection,\nsuicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across\n15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot,\nfew-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with\nstatistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on\nsuicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779),\nand risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood\nstatus recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost\nvocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B)\nsurpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like\nQwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though\nclosed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled\nwith size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with\nminimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured\npsychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition\nremains limited due to contextual complexity.

This\nmotivates the need for a generative model capable of designing diverse\nsequences while preserving structural consistency. To address this trade-off,\nwe introduce ProtInvTree, the first reward-guided tree-search framework for\nprotein inverse folding. ProtInvTree reformulates sequence generation as a\ndeliberate, step-wise decision-making process, enabling the exploration of\nmultiple design paths and exploitation of promising candidates through\nself-evaluation, lookahead, and backtracking. We propose a two-stage\nfocus-and-grounding action mechanism that decouples position selection and\nresidue generation. To efficiently evaluate intermediate states, we introduce a\njumpy denoising strategy that avoids full rollouts. Built upon pretrained\nprotein language models, ProtInvTree supports flexible test-time scaling by\nexpanding the search depth and breadth without retraining.

Crowdsourced data collection methods require\nstrict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may\nraise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue\ndatasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and\nauthenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing\napproach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions,\nensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks.

First, it introduces\na generalized Fourier expansion that can be used with any distribution $D$\nthrough the representation of the distribution as a Bayesian network (BN).\nSecond, it shows that the main algorithmic tools for learning with the Fourier\nrepresentation, that use membership queries to approximate functions by\nrecovering their heavy Fourier coefficients, can be used with slight\nmodifications with the generalized expansion.

Third, it analyzes the $L_1$ spectral norm of conjunctions under\nthe new expansion, showing that it is bounded for a class of distributions\nwhich can be represented by difference bounded tree BN, where a parent node in\nthe BN representation can change the conditional expectation of a child node by\nat most $\\alpha<0.5$. Lower bounds are presented to show that such constraints\nare necessary.

Nonetheless,\nachieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such\nmodels, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion\nsampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation.\nTo address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency\ndistillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models,\nenabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage\nparallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often\nshare the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling.

In GenDMR, we\ndevelop a novel approach to encode the spatial organization of single\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enhancing the representation of their genomic\ncontext. Additionally, to adaptively quantify the disease risk of SNPs and\nbrain region, we propose a multi-instance attention module to enhance model\ninterpretability. Furthermore, we introduce a dominant modality selection\nmodule and a contrastive self-distillation module, combining them to achieve a\ndynamic teacher-student role exchange mechanism based on dominant and auxiliary\nmodalities for bidirectional co-updating of different modal data. Finally,\nGenDMR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ADNI public dataset and\nvisualizes attention to different SNPs, focusing on confirming 12 potential\nhigh-risk genes related to AD, including the most classic APOE and recently\nhighlighted significant risk genes. This demonstrates GenDMR's interpretable\nanalytical capability in exploring AD genetic features, providing new insights\nand perspectives for the development of multimodal data fusion techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89d2\u8272\u4ea4\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GenDMR\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5355\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u591a\u6001\u6027\uff08SNPs\uff09\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3001\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9057\u4f20\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u540c\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5728ADNI\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGenDMR\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u8ba4\u4e8612\u4e2a\u4e0eAD\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u57fa\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u9057\u4f20\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u6bd4\u9057\u4f20\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8c03\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u9057\u4f20\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f16\u7801SNPs\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316SNPs\u548c\u8111\u533a\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u89d2\u8272\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u540c\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "GenDMR\u5728ADNI\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cSNPs\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e8612\u4e2a\u4e0eAD\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ecf\u5178\u7684APOE\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u98ce\u9669\u57fa\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "GenDMR\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63a2\u7d22AD\u9057\u4f20\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a stage-aware\nprompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a\nsequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the\nsemantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while\nensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a\nlarge language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify\ncontradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original\nintent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information\nwith the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic\ncontrol and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual\ncontradictions.

Experimental evaluations on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG\nmethods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving\nhigh-level efficiency and reliability.
