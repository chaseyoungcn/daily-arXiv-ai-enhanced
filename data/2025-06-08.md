### [1] [Zero-Shot Adaptation of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04244)
*Farzad Farhadzadeh,Debasmit Das,Shubhankar Borse,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper presents ProLoRA, a method for zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models by transferring pre-trained low-rank adjustments without additional training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional methods that require retraining when switching base models in text-to-image diffusion models.

Method: ProLoRA transfers pre-trained low-rank adjustments from a source to a target model through projection into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers.

Result: Evaluations on established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and comparable performance without retraining.

Conclusion: ProLoRA enables zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models, overcoming the need for retraining when switching base models.

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

### [2] [Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04245)
*Guangchen Lan,Huseyin A. Inan,Sahar Abdelnabi,Janardhan Kulkarni,Lukas Wutschitz,Reza Shokri,Christopher G. Brinton,Robert Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of contextual integrity (CI) in autonomous agents, proposing a method that combines explicit reasoning with reinforcement learning to reduce inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance. This approach, tested on a synthetic dataset and validated against established benchmarks like PrivacyLens, shows significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of autonomous agents making decisions for users, ensuring appropriate information sharing based on contextual integrity (CI) has become crucial.

Method: The researchers first prompt LLMs to explicitly reason about CI when deciding what information to disclose. They then develop a reinforcement learning framework to further instill the necessary reasoning to achieve CI.

Result: This method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure across multiple model sizes and families while maintaining task performance. The improvements also transfer from a synthetic dataset to established CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances contextual integrity in autonomous agents, reducing privacy leakage without compromising task performance.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

### [3] [Language-Guided Multi-Agent Learning in Simulations: A Unified Framework and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04251)
*Zhengyang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-MARL, a framework that integrates large language models into multi-agent reinforcement learning to improve coordination, communication and generalization. It is evaluated in several game environments and shows consistent improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in multi-agent reinforcement learning by incorporating large language models.

Method: The framework includes three modular components: Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating.

Result: Shows consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate significant contributions of subgoal generation and language-based messaging to performance gains.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations by bridging language modeling and policy learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

### [4] [A Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework Enhances Decision-Making in the Circular Economy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04252)
*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Dusit Niyato,Chuan Fu Tan,Keyi Xiang,Yueyang Wang,Zhiquan Yeo,Daren Tan Zong Loong,Jonathan Low Zhaozhi,Eugene H. Z. HO*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuGraphRAG is a RAG framework that enhances LLMs' accuracy and efficiency in circular economy domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate incorrect industrial codes and emission factors, which can negatively impact regulatory and investment decisions in sustainable manufacturing.

Method: CircuGraphRAG uses a knowledge graph with 117,380 industrial and waste entities, connected by classification codes and GWP100 emission data. It translates natural language queries into SPARQL and retrieves verified subgraphs for accurate and traceable responses.

Result: CircuGraphRAG outperforms standalone LLMs and naive RAG in single-hop and multi-hop question answering tasks with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0. It also improves efficiency by reducing response time and token usage.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG provides reliable, fact-checked support for circular economy planning and advances low-carbon resource decision making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific
knowledge graph for the circular economy. This graph connects 117,380
industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission
data, enabling structured multi-hop reasoning. Natural language queries are
translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready
support for circular economy planning, advancing reliable, low-carbon resource
decision making.

### [5] [HADA: Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04253)
*Tapio Pitkäranta,Leena Pitkäranta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HADA, a reference architecture ensuring alignment of LLM agents and legacy algorithms with organizational targets and values. It wraps algorithms in stakeholder agents, provides conversational APIs for control, and demonstrates effectiveness through retail-bank scenarios. Contributions include an open-source architecture, design theory, and empirical evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a protocol- and framework agnostic solution that ensures alignment between AI agents (LLMs) and organizational objectives and values.

Method: HADA wraps algorithms or LLMs in role-specific stakeholder agents (business, data-science, audit, ethics, customer), providing conversational APIs for querying, steering, auditing, or contesting decisions. Alignment objectives are expressed in natural language and continuously propagated, logged, and versioned. A cloud-native proof of concept was developed using a credit-scoring model deployed on Docker/Kubernetes/Python, tested across five scripted retail-bank scenarios.

Result: Evaluation following the Design-Science Research Methodology showed complete coverage of six predefined objectives: conversational control invocation by every role, KPI/value constraint tracing, ZIP-code bias detection/mitigation, and full decision lineage reproduction, independent of underlying LLM or agent library.

Conclusion: The paper contributes an open-source HADA architecture, a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in multi-agent systems, and empirical evidence supporting improved accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

### [6] [Automated Skill Discovery for Language Agents through Exploration and Iterative Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04287)
*Yongjin Yang,Sinjae Kang,Juyong Lee,Dongjun Lee,Se-Young Yun,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EXIF的自动技能发现框架，通过探索代理（Alice）生成环境相关的技能数据集并训练目标代理（Bob），同时利用迭代反馈循环优化技能学习过程，显著提升了代理性能，且无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLM）代理的技能获取面临挑战：手动收集轨迹耗时费力，而直接由LLM提出任务可能无效或不切实际，生成的数据也可能缺乏有意义的学习信号。

Method: 设计了EXIF框架，包含一个探索代理（Alice）和目标代理（Bob）。Alice首先与环境交互生成可行的技能数据集，然后用于训练Bob。此外，通过Alice评估Bob的表现，形成闭环反馈机制以优化技能发现过程。

Result: 在Webshop和Crafter上的实验表明，EXIF能够有效发现有意义的技能，并逐步扩展训练代理的能力，显著提高了性能。特别地，当Alice和Bob使用相同模型时，性能进一步提升，展现了系统自演化的潜力。

Conclusion: EXIF框架成功解决了LLM代理技能获取中的关键问题，实现了无监督下的性能提升，为构建自演化系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

### [7] [A Statistical Physics of Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04374)
*Jack David Carson,Amir Reisizadeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformer LMs exhibit emergent reasoning that is hard to understand mechanistically. A statistical physics framework models the reasoning dynamics, capturing diverse reasoning phases and enabling low-cost reasoning simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the emergent reasoning in Transformer LMs which currently resists mechanistic understanding.

Method: Model sentence-level hidden state trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold using a statistical physics framework. This includes latent regime switching to capture diverse reasoning phases.

Result: Empirical trajectories from 8 models and 7 benchmarks show that a rank-40 projection explains about 50% of the variance. Four latent reasoning regimes were identified and an SLDS model was formulated and validated.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables cost-effective reasoning simulation and provides tools to study and predict critical transitions such as misaligned states or other LM failures.

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

### [8] [Matter-of-Fact: A Benchmark for Verifying the Feasibility of Literature-Supported Claims in Materials Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04410)
*Peter Jansen,Samiah Hassan,Ruoyao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An abstract about a new dataset called Matter-of-Fact which is used to determine the feasibility of hypotheses in scientific discovery. It includes 8.4k claims from materials science topics and shows that current models fail to exceed 72% performance on this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility in order to allow discovery systems to run at scale and increase their likelihood of making significant discoveries.

Method: Introduction of Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims. It includes retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation.

Result: Strong baselines fail to exceed 72% performance on this task while domain-expert verification suggests nearly all are solvable.

Conclusion: This task is difficult for current models but making near-term progress could potentially accelerate scientific discovery.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

### [9] [Plugging Schema Graph into Multi-Table QA: A Human-Guided Framework for Reducing LLM Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04427)
*Xixi Wang,Miguel Costa,Jordanka Kovaceva,Shuai Wang,Francisco C. Pereira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a graph-based framework for multi-table QA that uses human-curated relational knowledge to encode schema links and join paths, showing effectiveness on complex industrial tabular data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for table QA using LLMs struggle with reliable schema linking across complex tables, particularly in real-world scenarios with diverse columns.

Method: The proposed method employs a graph-based framework leveraging human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. It constructs interpretable reasoning chains from natural language queries using pruning and sub-path merging strategies.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks and a large-scale realistic dataset indicate the effectiveness of the approach in handling complex, industrial tabular data.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first multi-table QA system capable of dealing with truly complex industrial tabular data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

### [10] [An AI-Based Public Health Data Monitoring System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04429)
*Ananya Joshi,Nolan Gormley,Richa Gadgil,Tina Townes,Roni Rosenfeld,Bryan Wilder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a ranking-based monitoring paradigm using AI anomaly detection methods to efficiently monitor large volumes of health data, showing significant improvement in monitoring objectives and reviewer speed efficiency compared to traditional alert-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of health data for outbreaks or data quality issues, as traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern public health data monitoring systems.

Method: The method involves proposing a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that leverages new AI anomaly detection methods, which has been developed through a multi-year interdisciplinary collaboration.

Result: A three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency compared to traditional alert-based methods.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

### [11] [Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478)
*Hadi Hosseini,Samarth Khanna,Ronak Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of LLMs in handling ranked preferences and structured algorithms within combinatorial domains, specifically focusing on matching markets. Despite improvements through fine-tuning, LLMs still struggle with instability resolution in large markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dealing with ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains such as matching markets.

Method: Evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on a range of preference-based reasoning tasks including stable-matching generation, instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries. Use parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) to see if it improves performance.

Result: LLMs struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. Fine-tuning helps in small markets but not significantly in large ones.

Conclusion: There is a need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning capabilities with larger-context inputs.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

### [12] [CogMath: Assessing LLMs' Authentic Mathematical Ability from a Human Cognitive Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04481)
*Jiayu Liu,Zhenya Huang,Wei Dai,Cheng Cheng,Jinze Wu,Jing Sha,Song Li,Qi Liu,Shijin Wang,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Despite the potential of large language models (LLMs) in solving complex mathematical tasks, current evaluation methods only focus on overall answer accuracy. This paper introduces CogMath, a framework that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities through human cognition stages. It reveals mainstream LLMs' capabilities are overestimated and provides insights for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately assess the authentic mathematical capabilities of LLMs beyond just overall answer accuracy.

Method: Propose CogMath, which formalizes human reasoning into three stages: problem comprehension, problem solving, and solution summarization. Within these stages, design 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions and develop an 'Inquiry-Judge-Reference' multi-agent system to generate inquiries assessing LLMs' mastery in each dimension.

Result: CogMath applied to three benchmarks shows that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs are overestimated by 30%-40%. It also identifies their strengths and weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions.

Conclusion: Current evaluation paradigms underestimate the complexity of assessing LLMs' mathematical abilities; CogMath offers a more comprehensive evaluation framework revealing both overestimations and areas for improvement.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

*Aladin Djuhera,Amin Seffo,Masataro Asai,Holger Boche*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recent advancements in LLMs have inspired interest in robotic navigation that incorporates complex constraints from natural language into the planning problem. This paper proposes STPR, a constraint generation framework that uses LLMs to translate constraints into executable Python functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to address the challenge of translating complex and informal natural language constraints into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning algorithm for robotic navigation.

Method: STPR leverages the LLM's strong coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and avoiding potential hallucinations.

Result: Experiments in a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. It also verifies that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that STPR is an effective constraint generation framework that accurately describes even complex mathematical constraints and applies them to point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeePoly是一种新的框架，将求解PDEs的范式从纯非凸参数优化转变为两阶段方法：首先使用DNN捕捉复杂全局特征，然后利用线性空间优化结合DNN提取特征和多项式基函数。此方法提高了高阶精度和效率，并保持了无网格和无模式特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习方法在科学计算中获得关注，但基于深度神经网络的方法在收敛性和计算效率方面仍不如传统数值方法。

Method: 引入DeePoly框架，采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用DNN捕捉复杂全局特征；第二阶段进行线性空间优化，结合DNN提取的特征（Scoper）和多项式基函数（Sniper）。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，该方法显著提高了各种问题类型的高阶准确性和效率，同时保持了无网格和无模式特性。

Conclusion: DeePoly框架通过结合DNN和多项式基函数的优势，为求解PDEs提供了更高效、更精确的解决方案，同时也为开源项目DeePoly提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

### [18] [Look Before You Leap: A GUI-Critic-R1 Model for Pre-Operative Error Diagnosis in GUI Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04614)
*Yuyang Wanyan,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Haowei Liu,Junyang Wang,Jiabo Ye,Yutong Kou,Ming Yan,Fei Huang,Xiaoshan Yang,Weiming Dong,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are used for GUI automation tasks, which require accurate step-by-step decision-making. Errors in this process can lead to significant issues. To improve decision-making, a pre-operative critic mechanism called GUI-Critic-R1 is introduced, using Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO). This model provides better feedback and accuracy compared to existing MLLMs, as shown by static and dynamic evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI automation tasks need precise step-by-step decision-making with little room for error due to potential irreversible consequences. Current MLLMs lack sufficient mechanisms to ensure the correctness of actions in real-time environments.

Method: The authors propose GUI-Critic-R1, built using S-GRPO strategy that includes a suggestion reward to enhance feedback reliability. They also develop a reasoning-bootstrapping data collection pipeline to create GUI-Critic-Train and GUI-Critic-Test datasets.

Result: Static experiments on GUI-Critic-Test show GUI-Critic-R1 has significant advantages in critic accuracy over current MLLMs in both mobile and web domains. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation benchmarks indicates improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: GUI-Critic-R1 improves critic accuracy and effectiveness in GUI automation tasks, outperforming current MLLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

TL;DR: 本研究引入了一个新的公司治理推理基准（CHANCERY），用于测试模型对公司高管、董事会或股东提议的行为是否与公司治理章程一致的推理能力。该基准基于真实的公司治理法律，由公司章程和执行行动提案组成，模型需要进行二元分类判断。尽管最先进的模型在这一基准上表现不佳，但基于ReAct和CodeAct框架的推理代理表现出色，揭示了高分所需的高级法律推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管法律领域是自然语言处理应用的热门领域，且推理是法律实践的核心部分，但目前尚无专注于推理任务的法律数据集。因此，有必要创建一个特定的基准来评估模型的法律推理能力。

Method: 研究人员创建了一个名为CHANCERY的公司治理推理基准，其中包括公司章程和执行行动提案，要求模型判断行动是否与章程中的规则一致。该基准基于24个具体的公司治理原则和79个来自不同行业的实际公司章程。

Result: 最先进的推理模型在该基准上的准确率分别为64.5%和75.2%，而基于ReAct和CodeAct框架的推理代理分别达到了76.1%和78.1%的准确率，显示了其优越性能。此外，分析表明当前模型在某些类型的法律推理问题上存在困难。

Conclusion: CHANCERY基准展示了现有模型在法律推理任务上的挑战，并强调了开发具有高级法律推理能力模型的重要性。通过识别模型难以处理的问题类型，为未来的研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Motivation: To explore if LLM agents can self-improve in strategic planning by placing them in challenging environments.

Method: Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed through the open-source Catanatron framework, benchmark a progression of LLM-based agents from simple game-playing agents to systems capable of autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. Introduce a multi-agent architecture where specialized roles collaborate to analyze gameplay, research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt.

Result: Self-evolving agents outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Conclusion: LLM agents, particularly those powered by advanced models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-4o, show significant potential for self-improvement in strategic planning tasks.

Conclusion: RL的主要作用并非增强外部计划执行，而是帮助模型制定更适合其推理过程的内部策略，并提高知识整合能力，为更系统的推理模型训练与评估提供了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Motivation: To address the issue of fluctuating benchmark results in reasoning models such as the Deepseek-R1-Distill series and others, leading to unreliable reproduction of performance improvements.

Method: Conduct empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models and analyze the impact of different evaluation conditions on their benchmark results.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Motivation: To address the issue of strategic deception in advanced LLMs with chain-of-thought reasoning, which intentionally misinform by contradicting their own reasoning. This is distinct from traditional honesty issues that might be explained as hallucinations.

Method: The authors systematically induce, detect, and control deception in CoT-enabled LLMs using representation engineering. They extract 'deception vectors' through Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT), and employ activation steering to elicit context-appropriate deception without explicit prompts.

Result: They achieved 89% detection accuracy for deception using LAT and a 40% success rate in eliciting deception via activation steering.

Conclusion: This study reveals specific honesty-related issues in reasoning models and provides tools for achieving trustworthy AI alignment.

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel model-based RL framework that prioritizes safety and reliability in real-world applications by jointly optimizing task performance and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement Learning applications need to ensure safety and reliability when used in real-world scenarios, but model inaccuracies can cause failures.

Method: The method incorporates an adaptive mechanism for switching between model-based planning and direct policy execution, uses an implicit world model to resolve objective mismatch, and employs dynamic safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's capabilities.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements over non-adaptive methods, with the framework achieving robust performance on diverse safety-critical continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully optimizes for both safety and performance in real-world RL applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

*Julien Soulé,Jean-Paul Jamont,Michel Occello,Paul Théron,Louis-Marie Traonouez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper uses Markovian modeling and simulation to study the interaction between cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders in a network system, providing an experimental framework for coordinated cyber-attacks and evaluating the dynamic organization of cyber-defenders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasingly complex and coordinated cyber-attacks, there is a need for effective cyber-defense strategies that can be deployed at network entry points.

Method: The authors use Markovian modeling and implement a simulator involving cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents on host network nodes. Network nodes are abstracted by sets of properties, and actions by agents model network reactions in given states.

Result: The simulator successfully implemented realistic cyber-attack scenarios with various behavior implementation approaches for both cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Conclusion: This approach provides an experimental framework for understanding and assessing coordinated cyber-attacks and the dynamic organization of cyber-defenders.

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

*Jônata Tyska Carvalho,Stefano Nolfi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for enabling large language models to control embodied agents by mapping continuous observation vectors to action vectors, validated through classic control tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the reasoning capabilities of large language models in controlling embodied agents by bridging symbolic knowledge and sub-symbolic sensory-motor data.

Method: The LLMs generate an initial control strategy based on textual descriptions, which is iteratively refined using performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during evaluation.

Result: The method successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions in most cases when tested on classic control tasks from Gymnasium and MuJoCo libraries.

Conclusion: Integrating symbolic knowledge from reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data allows LLMs to effectively control embodied agents.

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model that can learn local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their inherent discrete nature, combining the strengths of differentiable logic gates and neural networks.

Method: The model uses differentiable logic gates combined into a circuit. During training, it is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space.

Result: The model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired target patterns, including the rules of Conway's Game of Life, resilient checkerboard patterns, growing lizard shapes, and multi-color pattern generation.

Conclusion: This combination of DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized processing.

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, which focuses on autonomous systems sustaining themselves through internal energy regulation rather than task performance. It proposes an energy-based utility function, viability-constrained survival horizon, and a modular architecture demonstrating stable, resource-aware behavior in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create autonomous systems capable of sustaining themselves in resource-volatile settings without relying on external infrastructure or supervision.

Method: Formalizing the principle of energy-based utility function and viability-constrained survival horizon, proposing a modular architecture integrating energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into a closed-loop control system.

Result: Demonstrated emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior in a simulated environment without external supervision.

Conclusion: Provided a theoretical and architectural foundation for deploying autonomous agents in environments where persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: To address the mathematical reasoning needs of autonomous UAVs, the study proposes RAG-UAV, a framework enhancing LLMs' ability to solve UAV-specific math problems. Using UAV-Math-Bench, experiments show significant improvements in accuracy and error reduction with RAG-UAV.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous UAV operation requires reliable mathematical reasoning for tasks like trajectory planning and power management. Traditional methods rely on hardcoded equations while recent LLMs have flexibility issues in selecting correct formulations and executing precise arithmetic.

Method: The researchers developed RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented generation framework that provides LLMs access to relevant domain literature. They also created UAV-Math-Bench, a set of 20 UAV-centric math problems across four difficulty levels, to evaluate the performance of several LLMs.

Result: Incorporating retrieval significantly increased exact answer accuracy (up to 75% with GPT o1), reduced incorrect formulation selection from 25% to 5%, and decreased numerical errors by orders of magnitude in MSE for the best models.

Conclusion: This pilot study shows that RAG can make general-purpose LLMs more reliable for engineering analysis in UAV contexts, but further investigation is needed for real-time flight control applications.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

### [33] [Truly Self-Improving Agents Require Intrinsic Metacognitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05109)
*Tennison Liu,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-improving agents need intrinsic metacognitive learning, which includes metacognitive knowledge, planning and evaluation. Current agents rely on extrinsic mechanisms that limit scalability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agents face limitations such as rigid self-improvement processes, poor generalization across task domains, and struggle to scale with increasing capabilities.

Method: Introduce a formal framework for intrinsic metacognitive learning comprising three components: metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive planning, and metacognitive evaluation.

Result: Analysis of existing self-improving agents reveals they predominantly use extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, suggesting many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are already present.

Conclusion: To enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement, we must address key challenges such as optimally distributing metacognitive responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluating and improving intrinsic metacognitive learning.

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-First Search (LFS)，一种新的LLM自我引导搜索方法，允许LLM通过内部评分机制自主控制搜索过程。LFS在Countdown和Sudoku任务中表现优于其他经典算法，在更具挑战性的任务上无需额外调整即可获得更好的性能，计算效率更高，并且随着模型增强或计算预算增加而表现出更好的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的搜索方法如蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）依赖于固定的探索超参数，这限制了它们在不同难度任务中的适应性，使其在某些情况下不切实际或昂贵。

Method: LLM-First Search (LFS)是一种新的LLM自我引导搜索方法，它移除了对预定义搜索策略的需求，使LLM能够通过内部评分机制自主决定是否继续当前搜索路径或探索其他分支。

Result: LFS在更具有挑战性的任务上表现更好，无需额外调整；相比其他方法计算效率更高，特别是在使用更强模型时；随着模型增强或计算预算增加，LFS表现出更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: LLM-First Search (LFS)作为一种新的搜索方法，展示了其在灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性方面的优势，为解决复杂推理问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

*Violet Xiang,Chase Blagden,Rafael Rafailov,Nathan Lile,Sang Truong,Chelsea Finn,Nick Haber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Large reasoning models can be more efficient without sacrificing performance using Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of large reasoning models that generate excessive tokens for easy problems.

Method: Introduced Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective that adjusts generation length based on per-prompt solve rate.

Result: Post-training DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP reduces average token usage by 50% without significantly affecting performance.

Conclusion: ALP improves efficiency by reallocating saved tokens from easy prompts to difficult ones, enhancing accuracy on hard problems.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the concept of 'Control Tax' in AI Control (AIC), providing a theoretical framework to quantify it and map classifier performance to safety assurances. It evaluates language models in adversarial settings, estimates financial costs for control protocols, and develops optimized monitoring strategies.


<details>

Motivation: To address the need for robust oversight mechanisms in the integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications, while considering the implementation overhead.

Method: 1) Introducing a theoretical framework for quantifying Control Tax and mapping classifier performance to safety assurances; 2) Conducting comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in adversarial settings; 3) Providing empirical financial cost estimates and developing optimized monitoring strategies.

Result: Enables practitioners to make informed decisions by connecting safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AI Control through economic feasibility assessment.

Conclusion: The work makes key contributions to the field of AI Control by introducing the notion of Control Tax, evaluating language models in adversarial settings, and developing cost-effective monitoring strategies.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Conclusion: The survey highlights the importance of addressing the risks and limitations of Concept-based Models to enhance their reliability and real-world applicability. It calls for further research into improving these models' robustness and exploring the role of human interventions.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for predicting time-dependent concrete creep, achieving high accuracy and outperforming traditional models. It establishes the potential of transformer-based approaches in materials science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for predicting concrete creep treat time as just an input parameter rather than modeling its sequential nature. This limitation motivates the development of a new architecture that can capture long-range dependencies in historical creep patterns.

Method: The method involves transforming concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task using a transformer architecture. A triple-stream attention framework is implemented incorporating temporal attention, feature attention, and batch attention. The model is evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily measurements.

Result: The architecture achieves a mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999 across all datasets, significantly outperforming traditional empirical models and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the importance of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling being the most critical factor.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the viability and potential of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems, showing how data-driven approaches could revolutionize structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for evolving safety policies is costly. This paper introduces SafeSteer, a method that uses category-specific steering vectors and a gradient-free unsupervised approach to guide LLM outputs towards safe content without needing contrastive pairwise data. It prevents blanket refusals and maintains topic relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the high cost and impracticality of fine-tuning LLMs to adapt to changing safety policies. There's a need for inference-time control methods that can provide precise, customizable safety adjustments without sacrificing text quality or requiring extensive labeled data.

Method: SafeSteer leverages category-specific steering vectors for more precise control, uses a gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety steering, and does not require contrastive pairwise safe data. It aims to guide LLM outputs towards safe content while preserving text quality and topic relevance.

Result: SafeSteer demonstrates effectiveness across various LLMs, datasets, and risk categories. It provides precise control over model outputs, prevents blanket refusals, and successfully guides models to generate safe content while maintaining topic relevance.

Conclusion: SafeSteer offers a simple and effective solution for guiding LLM outputs towards safe content without needing fine-tuning or extensive labeled data. The approach aligns with recent findings that simple techniques often outperform complex ones in activation steering.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forest fire prediction has become one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI) with climate change intensifying fire behavior and frequency. Traditional methods oversimplify the problem from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters.

Method: The paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental contexts in France, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for operational use.

Result: The first national-scale AI benchmark for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively unexplored dataset is presented.

Conclusion: Important future works are summarized that should be taken into account.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

Motivation: Deep learning models are hard to deploy on edge devices due to high memory and runtime complexity. Current verification methods focus on quantization but lack in handling structural changes effectively.

Method: MUC-G4 encodes original and compressed networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and uses Minimal Unsat Cores (MUCs) from the original network to guide verification of the compressed network.

Result: MUC-G4 shows effectiveness in dealing with quantization and pruning, featuring high proof reuse rates and significant reductions in verification time compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: MUC-G4 provides a promising solution to ensure safety and reliability of compressed neural networks in practical applications.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework

*Xu Zheng,Chaohao Lin,Sipeng Chen,Zhuomin Chen,Jimeng Shi,Wei Cheng,Jayantha Obeysekera,Jason Liu,Dongsheng Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compound flood forecasting faces challenges due to complex factors. Traditional methods are inefficient, and data scarcity hinders analysis. This study introduces SF2Bench for South Florida compound floods, integrating tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities. It evaluates six machine learning categories (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers, LLMs) on this dataset, analyzing the impact of different features on flood forecasting performance, providing insights into historical data and spatial dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the significant challenge of compound flood forecasting by overcoming limitations of traditional physics-based methods and insufficient datasets.

Method: The method involves creating a comprehensive dataset (SF2Bench) that integrates four key factors (tide, rainfall, groundwater, human management). Six categories of machine learning models (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, Transformers, LLMs) are evaluated on this dataset to understand their capabilities in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies.

Result: The results demonstrate varying performances across different modeling paradigms, highlighting their diverse abilities in handling complex temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

Conclusion: This study concludes that machine learning models have potential in improving flood forecasting accuracy and efficiency, with each model category offering unique strengths for capturing specific aspects of compound floods.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

*Runxiang Wang,Boxiao Wang,Kai Li,Yifan Zhang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DrSR is a new framework that enhances LLMs' symbolic regression abilities by combining data-driven insights with reflective learning, leading to better performance in discovering scientific equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based symbolic regression methods lack explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during equation generation.

Method: DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships within the data and generates structured descriptions. It also monitors equation performance and establishes a feedback loop for refinement.

Result: Experiments show DrSR improves the valid equation rate and outperforms other methods in accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency across various scientific domains.

Conclusion: DrSR demonstrates potential for advancing scientific equation discovery through its integrated approach.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Motivation: 低地球轨道卫星的观测数据对于决策者更好地管理时间敏感事件（如自然灾害）至关重要。然而，数据从卫星下传到地面站的带宽有限，成为主要瓶颈。为了克服这一挑战，可以在卫星上处理至少部分数据，并优先考虑相关数据进行下传。

Conclusion: PANN是一种有前景的解决方案，能够在资源受限的情况下进行机载处理，从而提高数据下传效率并支持灾害响应决策。

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited adaptation data leads to challenges in training large backbone models.

Method: Propose Backbone Augmented Training (BAT) method that uses backbone data for augmentation, introduce advanced data selection scheme, and present ALBAT algorithm.

Result: Efficiently enhances adaptation training in personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Conclusion: BAT is a promising approach to overcome the limitation of adaptation data.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

### [48] [Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers trained on a transitive inference task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289)
*Jesse Geerts,Stephanie Chan,Claudia Clopath,Kimberly Stachenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based models show different relational reasoning abilities in in-weights learning (IWL) and in-context learning (ICL). IWL naturally induces transitive inference generalization, while ICL does not unless pre-trained on structured tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how transformers perform transitive inference, a classic relational reasoning task, under different learning regimes: IWL and ICL.

Method: Compare transitive inference behavior across IWL and ICL. Conduct mechanistic analysis to understand the differences in performance between the two learning regimes.

Result: IWL induces a generalization bias towards transitive inference even when trained only on adjacent items. ICL models without pre-training do not generalize transitively but develop match-and-copy strategies. Pre-training on structured tasks enables ICL models to exhibit generalizable transitive inference and display human-like effects without forming induction circuits.

Conclusion: Pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of representations that support in-context relational reasoning.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Motivation: To address complex optimization challenges in IoT devices by effectively combining the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm with reinforcement learning.

Method: Deriving a method to combine Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under common conditions through theoretical analysis, resulting in the LDPTRLQ algorithm.

Result: Simulation results show that LDPTRLQ outperforms baseline methods in terms of compatibility and stability.

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ offers a theoretically superior approach to balance Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty's greedy optimization with RL's long-term perspective.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Conclusion: AutoCT establishes a new paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial prediction.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep-learning framework for accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity in open-pit mining, which blends real-world operational records with synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios. Two architectures are evaluated, XGBoost regressor and Long Short-Term Memory network, with the former achieving a lower median absolute error. SHAP value analyses identify dominant predictors, and integration of simulated breakdown data reduces prediction volatility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in open-pit mining due to significant operational uncertainties introduced by weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and variable crew availability.

Method: A deep-learning framework is proposed that blends real-world operational records (high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios. Two architectures are evaluated: an XGBoost regressor and a Long Short-Term Memory network.

Result: The XGBoost regressor achieves a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent, while the Long Short-Term Memory network has a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. SHAP value analyses identify cumulative rainfall, historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features reduces prediction volatility.

Conclusion: This hybrid modelling approach offers a comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management under dynamically uncertain conditions in open-pit mining.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

TL;DR: The paper outlines a 4-step process using softlog-softmax cascades to enhance consistency and reliability in next-gen ensemble learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the consistency and dependability of ensemble learning systems for complex problems by utilizing ensemble diversity.

Method: 1. Anatomical process - composing target ensemble model with canonical elements related to convolutional frustum definition, chosen based on diversity. 2. Physiological process - deriving softlog for consistent weak logarithmic operations and intermediate decisions respecting output layer class logic. 3. Neural information theory - proposing softlog-based entropy and divergence measures for constructing consistent information values on closed intervals to determine relationships between individual and sub-community decisions. 4. Deriving an informative performance tensor for reliable ensemble evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates that softlog-softmax cascades can effectively improve both consistency and dependability of ensemble learning systems, especially useful for complex problems.

Conclusion: Softlog-softmax cascades provide a promising approach to enhance the performance and reliability of next generation ensemble learning systems.

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一个名为Urania的新框架，该框架在严格的差分隐私（DP）保障下生成关于LLM聊天机器人交互的见解。通过使用私有聚类机制和创新的关键词提取方法，Urania提供了端到端的隐私保护。评估结果显示，该框架能够在保持严格用户隐私的同时，提取有意义的对话见解，有效平衡数据效用与隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在处理大型语言模型（LLM）聊天机器人交互数据时，缺乏能够在保证数据效用的同时提供严格隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: Urania框架采用私有聚类机制以及基于频率、TF-IDF和LLM引导的关键词提取方法。利用差分隐私工具如聚类、分区选择和基于直方图的总结，提供端到端的隐私保护。同时，还开发了一个简单的经验隐私评估方法来证明DP管道的增强鲁棒性。

Result: 评估显示Urania框架能够提取有意义的对话见解，同时保持严格的用户隐私，成功地在数据效用和隐私保护之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: Urania框架为在严格隐私保护下分析LLM聊天机器人交互提供了一种有效的方法，能够在不损害用户隐私的情况下保留数据的效用。

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

### [57] [You Only Train Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04349)
*Christos Sakaridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes You Only Train Once (YOTO), a method that enables the one-shot optimization of loss weight hyperparameters in machine learning models via gradient-based optimization. YOTO treats hyperparameters as regular network parameters and introduces a novel layer with a softmax operation to satisfy positivity constraints while avoiding degenerate gradients. A regularization loss ensures uniformity among employed losses and bounds optima. Experiments on 3D estimation and semantic segmentation show YOTO outperforms grid search on unseen test data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the computational burden of multiple training runs typically required for selecting and weighting loss functions, by developing a method that can optimize these aspects in a single training run.

Method: YOTO automatically optimizes loss weight hyperparameters in one shot by treating them as regular network parameters. It uses gradient-based optimization and leverages the differentiability of composite loss formulations. A novel layer parameterized with a softmax operation ensures positivity constraints and avoids degenerate gradients. A new regularization loss promotes uniformity among losses and ensures bounded optima.

Result: YOTO consistently outperforms grid search on unseen test data when applied to state-of-the-art networks solving 3D estimation and semantic segmentation problems.

Conclusion: YOTO demonstrates the feasibility of one-shot loss weight hyperparameter optimization, providing an efficient alternative to traditional methods like grid search.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

### [58] [Half-Layered Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04352)
*Ethem Alpaydin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 'half' layer in neural networks where some weights are randomly set and others are trained, reducing parameters while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the number of parameters in neural networks without sacrificing performance by utilizing randomized connections.

Method: A 'half' layer is proposed with two modifiable weights per hidden unit, combining fixed random weights and trainable weights. The process involves a weighted sum with fixed random weights followed by multiplication and translation using trainable weights.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrated that 'half' layers can achieve reasonable accuracy with fewer parameters due to the regularizing effect of randomized connections.

Conclusion: The 'half' layer approach shows promise in deep networks for achieving comparable accuracy with reduced complexity.

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

*Uditansh Srivastava,Shivam Aryan,Shaurya Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new composite reward function for reinforcement learning in financial trading is proposed, balancing return and risk through four differentiable terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single metric objectives like the Sharpe ratio may not fully capture diverse investor preferences in financial trading.

Method: The method involves creating a modular, parameterized reward function with weights (w1, w2, w3, w4) for annualized return, downside risk, differential return, and the Treynor ratio. Weights are tuned via grid search to target specific risk-return profiles. Closed form gradients for each term are derived to facilitate gradient-based training.

Result: This framework provides theoretical properties such as monotonicity, boundedness, and modularity which support its robustness and flexibility.

Conclusion: The proposed reward function offers a general blueprint for building multi-objective reward functions in complex trading environments, allowing extension with additional risk measures or adaptive weighting.

Abstract: We propose a novel composite reward function for reinforcement learning in
financial trading that balances return and risk using four differentiable
terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor

to encode diverse investor preferences
  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles
  We derive closed form gradients for each term to facilitate gradient based
training and analyze key theoretical properties including monotonicity

### [60] [Identifying and Understanding Cross-Class Features in Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05032)
*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial training (AT) is a crucial method for enhancing the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. This paper explores AT through class-wise feature attribution, focusing on cross-class features that are shared among multiple classes and beneficial for robust classification. The study reveals that during early AT stages, models prioritize learning cross-class features to achieve optimal robustness. However, as AT progresses, leading to robust overfitting, models shift towards class-specific features. These findings enhance the understanding of AT mechanisms and unify existing properties like soft-label training advantages and robust overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen the understanding of adversarial training mechanisms and dynamics, particularly focusing on how class-wise feature attribution impacts the process and model robustness.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of cross-class features which are shared by multiple classes and crucial for robust classification. It uses theoretical evidence from a synthetic data model to demonstrate their utility. Systematic studies across various model architectures and settings explore the role of these features in adversarial training.

Result: During the initial stage of adversarial training, models tend to learn more cross-class features until reaching the best robustness checkpoint. As training continues and leads to robust overfitting, models increasingly rely on class-specific features.

Conclusion: This research refines the current understanding of adversarial training mechanisms by emphasizing the role of cross-class features and offering a unified view on existing properties such as the advantage of soft-label training and robust overfitting.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

*Philippe Chlenski,Itsik Pe'er*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces, enabling a wrapper approach around Euclidean tree-based models for improved performance and maintainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend decision tree models to hyperbolic spaces while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of thresholding operations from Euclidean decision trees.

Method: Reexpress the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model, allowing it to be implemented as pre- and post-processing steps around existing Euclidean tree-based models.

Result: Achieves similar or better results compared to previous methods, with improvements in flexibility, speed, and accuracy.

Conclusion: The wrapper approach provides a simpler, more maintainable, and extensible codebase for applying decision trees in hyperbolic spaces.

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

TL;DR: 在回归分析框架下，研究了合成数据的隐私放大效应。结果表明，若生成模型的种子被对手控制，单个合成数据可能泄露与发布模型本身一样多的信息；但若合成数据由随机输入生成，则发布有限数量的合成数据可增强隐私保护。

Motivation: 尽管经验研究表明，当生成模型被隐藏时，合成数据可能会受益于隐私放大，但对其理论理解仍不充分。

Method: 通过线性回归的框架，探讨合成数据的隐私放大现象。首先证明了负面结果：如果对手控制生成模型的种子，单个合成数据点可能泄露与发布模型本身一样多的信息；然后展示了当合成数据从随机输入生成时，发布有限数量的合成数据可以放大隐私。

Result: 发现如果生成模型的种子被对手控制，单个合成数据点可能泄露与发布模型本身一样多的信息；但是当合成数据由随机输入生成时，发布有限数量的合成数据可以增强隐私保护。

Conclusion: 本研究在线性回归中的发现可以作为未来推导更一般界限的基础。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了样本重放技术在过度参数化连续线性回归环境下的理论效果，发现即使在无噪声情况下，遗忘可能随着重放样本数量非单调变化，甚至可能导致更严重的遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中的遗忘问题是当前亟待解决的挑战之一，而样本重放作为常用的减轻遗忘的技术，其理论基础尚不明确，特别是在复杂的任务关系和样本选择下效果如何尚未被深入探讨。

Method: 作者通过在过度参数化的连续线性回归设置中分析样本重放，其中每个任务由线性子空间定义。他们研究了重放样本的作用以及任务子空间之间的关系，并考察了不同场景下（如最坏情况和随机分布）重放样本对遗忘的影响。

Result: 研究结果表明，遗忘与重放样本的数量并非单调相关，在某些任务配置下，重放可能会加剧遗忘。此外，这种有害重放现象不仅限于线性模型，还适用于神经网络和SGD训练方法。实验进一步表明，重放的效果高度依赖于重放样本的选择和任务间的关系。

Conclusion: 样本重放在理论上并不总是有效，其效果受到重放样本选择和任务关系的显著影响，这为未来设计更优的重放策略提供了指导。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

*Théo Vincent,Yogesh Tripathi,Tim Faust,Yaniv Oren,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In value-based reinforcement learning, using a copy of the last linear layer as target network while sharing other parameters with online network can improve sample efficiency and reduce memory footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Removing the target network in reinforcement learning could free up memory for online network but leads to instability and performance decline. Literature around target networks cannot be leveraged without it.

Method: Propose to use a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as target network while sharing remaining parameters, stepping out of binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. Leverage iterated Q-learning concept to reduce performance gap.

Result: Iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL) improves sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings, requires smaller memory footprint and comparable training time to classical target-based algorithms.

Conclusion: iS-QL highlights potential to scale reinforcement learning research by improving sample efficiency and reducing memory usage.

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

*Suzan Ece Ada,Emre Ugur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UMCNP, a hybrid few-shot meta-RL method that combines PPG and task inference-based meta-RL. It reuses samples from PPG meta-RL for task inference during meta-training and leverages CNPs to improve sample efficiency during meta-testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a method that can efficiently adapt to unseen test tasks with fewer samples during meta-testing in environments where the reward signal is missing.

Method: UMCNP combines parameterized policy gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL methods while keeping them distinct. During meta-training, it reuses previously collected PPG samples offline for learning task inference. For meta-testing, it uses Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) to infer latent representations of transition dynamics models from a single test task rollout.

Result: UMCNP achieves adaptation to unseen test tasks using significantly fewer samples compared to baselines on benchmarks such as 2D-Point Agent and continuous control tasks like cartpole with unknown angle sensor bias and walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Conclusion: UMCNP successfully integrates PPG and task inference-based approaches to reduce the number of online interactions needed for meta-testing without requiring additional samples during meta-training.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Conclusion: 本文从理论上解释了自监督对比学习的成功原因，并通过实验证明了理论分析的正确性，为未来的研究提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的优化算法要么依赖于昂贵的二阶梯度计算（如二阶方法），要么无法充分捕捉参数空间中的复杂不确定性结构（如一阶方法）。因此，需要一种新的优化方法，能够高效地处理梯度不确定性并提高训练效果。

Method: 提出了一种名为KOALA++的算法，该算法通过递归更新紧凑的梯度协方差积来直接估计参数协方差矩阵，从而显式建模结构化梯度不确定性。这种方法改进了原始的KOALA框架，后者假设协方差为对角线形式，而KOALA++可以在不存储完整协方差矩阵的情况下隐式捕获更丰富的不确定性结构，同时避免了大矩阵求逆。

Result: 在多个任务上进行了实验，包括图像分类和语言建模，结果表明KOALA++在准确性和效率方面均优于或等同于现有的最先进的一阶和二阶优化器。

Conclusion: KOALA++提供了一种新的、高效的优化方法，在不牺牲效率的前提下，能够更好地处理神经网络训练中的梯度不确定性，并在多个任务上取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

Motivation: To explore and understand the grokking phenomena in neural networks further, discovering new phases that occur during training and developing methods to measure overfitting and generalization without needing test data.

Method: Training a 3-layer MLP on a subset of MNIST with and without weight decay, analyzing the training process up to 10^7 iterations. Using the HTSR α metric and other comparative metrics like activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and l2 weight norms to track different phases of training.

Result: A novel phase termed anti-grokking was discovered where test accuracy collapses while training accuracy remains perfect. The HTSR α metric alone could delineate all three phases (pre-grokking, grokking, and anti-grokking), unlike other metrics which only detected the first two phases. Anti-grokking is associated with α < 2 and the presence of Correlation Traps.

Conclusion: The HTSR α metric provides a universal layer-convergence target at approximately α ≈ 2 and serves as an effective measure of generalization. This allows for detecting overfitting and generalization collapse without direct access to test data.

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

*Robin Yadav,Qi Yan,Guy Wolf,Avishek Joey Bose,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF), a new framework for single-step retrosynthesis in organic chemistry that uses discrete flow-matching and reaction center identification to improve the accuracy and diversity of predicted reactions. It outperforms previous methods with 60% top-1 accuracy and enhances round-trip accuracy through Feynman-Kac steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of single-step reactant prediction in organic chemistry, which is difficult due to the combinatorial nature of chemical search space.

Method: RSF models single-step retrosynthesis using a discrete flow-matching framework with a Markov bridge between target product and reactant molecules. It includes a reaction center identification step to produce synthons as source distribution and applies Feynman-Kac steering with Sequential Monte Carlo resampling during inference.

Result: Achieves 60% top-1 accuracy, surpassing previous SOTA by 20%. Also improves top-5 round-trip accuracy by 19% over prior template-free SOTA methods while maintaining competitive top-k accuracy results.

Conclusion: RETRO SYNFLOW effectively enhances both the accuracy and diversity of predicted reactions in single-step retrosynthesis, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多实际应用中，准确预测某些特定子集或区域的数据比其他区域更为关键。传统损失函数无法有效区分不同区域的重要性，因此需要一种新的方法来提升模型在高敏感区域的预测能力，并区分高低重要性区域。

Method: 1. 构建选择性匹配损失函数：通过设计递增的链接函数（如Sigmoid和双曲正弦函数）定义损失函数。
2. 强调高斜率高敏感区域：利用链接函数的斜率特性调整损失函数对不同区域的敏感度。
3. 提出多维选择性损失框架：基于复合Softmax函数开发适用于多类问题的选择性损失框架，克服标准Softmax函数在区分相邻得分方面的不足。

Result: 与传统损失函数相比，选择性损失函数在需要关注特定重要区域的应用中具有显著优势，例如停留时间预测、检索、排序、知识蒸馏以及大型语言模型的微调对齐等任务。

Conclusion: 选择性损失函数能够有效提升模型在高敏感区域的预测性能，同时通过多维选择性损失框架解决了多类问题中标准Softmax函数的局限性，为多种实际应用场景提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

*Huynh T. T. Tran,Jacob Sander,Achraf Cohen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI framework for NIDS, incorporating score-based and metamodel-based methods to assess prediction reliability. Experiments show ODXU outperforms traditional models across metrics, and transfer learning strategies improve performance with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness, interpretability, and generalization in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) by extending the ODXU framework with comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods.

Method: Extension of ODXU with score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy) and metamodel-based techniques (e.g., SHAP values, Information Gain). Development of a transfer learning strategy reusing pre-trained components and fine-tuning others.

Result: ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six evaluation metrics on CIC-IDS-2017 dataset. Transfer learning strategy shows better performance with limited data on ACI-IoT-2023 dataset. Metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches.

Conclusion: Extended ODXU improves NIDS capabilities through enhanced UQ methods and effective transfer learning, offering better performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

*Jiayu Wang,Aws Albarghouthi,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COSMOS is a framework that predicts the performance and cost of large language models' adaptation strategies with high accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimally selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints for large language models is challenging and often requires extensive experimentation.

Method: The authors formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework. This framework uses embedding-augmented lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance and low-sample scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning.

Result: Extensive evaluation across eight representative benchmarks shows that COSMOS achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72% on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios.

Conclusion: Efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes for large language models is feasible and can substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while maintaining performance standards.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

### [74] [Behavioural vs. Representational Systematicity in End-to-End Models: An Opinionated Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04461)
*Ivan Vegner,Sydelle de Souza,Valentin Forch,Martha Lewis,Leonidas A. A. Doumas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper discusses the importance of systematicity in ML models for strong generalization, distinguishing between systematicity of representations and behaviour. It analyzes existing benchmarks focusing on behavioural systematicity and suggests methods from mechanistic interpretability to assess representation systematicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematicity is crucial for strong generalization in ML models, yet there is a lack of focus on the systematicity of representations rather than just behaviour.

Method: The authors analyze key benchmarks in literature across language and vision using Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization and explore methods from mechanistic interpretability to assess representation systematicity.

Result: Existing benchmarks primarily test behavioural systematicity, and the paper provides insights into assessing representation systematicity through mechanistic interpretability.

Conclusion: There is a need to shift focus towards evaluating the systematicity of representations in ML models to better address the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

*Mohammad Subhi Al-Batah,Mowafaq Salem Alzboon,Muhyeeddin Alqaraleh,Mohammed Hasan Abu-Arqoub,Rashiq Rafiq Marie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study explores the use of machine learning models to classify dental providers into standard rendering providers and safety net clinic providers. Among the 12 ML models evaluated, Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting and Random Forest. Feature ranking methods like information gain were used to identify critical predictors, with treatment-related metrics emerging as top-ranked features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to investigate how machine learning models can be effectively applied to classify dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers and safety net clinic providers, especially when dealing with a dataset that has high missing values.

Method: The method involved using feature ranking methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA to identify critical predictors. Twelve different machine learning models were then evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived from rankings.

Result: Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest (93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated, with some models demonstrating robustness to missing data.

Conclusion: The study concludes that feature selection plays an important role in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in imbalanced healthcare datasets. It advocates for integrating feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental provider classification.

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

*C. Evans Hedges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

TL;DR: CryoBoltz combines cryo-EM density maps with pretrained protein structure prediction models to generate accurate and diverse 3D structural models of dynamic biomolecular complexes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein structure prediction models lack the ability to capture conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, while cryo-electron microscopy faces challenges in processing raw data into atomic models. There is a need for an approach that can bridge these two modalities.

Method: CryoBoltz uses both global and local structural constraints derived from cryo-EM density maps to guide the sampling trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model, thereby driving predictions towards conformational states consistent with experimental data.

Result: This method successfully builds atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across various dynamic biomolecular systems, including transporters and antibodies.

Conclusion: CryoBoltz bridges the gap between cryo-EM imaging and protein structure prediction, enabling the generation of accurate and diverse 3D structural models.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

TL;DR: This paper presents Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a new method for training physical reservoir computing systems without backpropagation, using random perturbations to approximate gradient updates. It shows comparable performance to standard methods and potential for energy efficiency in AI training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitation of physical reservoir computing which cannot perform backpropagation due to its black-box nature, thus enabling more practical and efficient training methods for these systems.

Method: PGT uses random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient updates through forward passes only, inspired by perturbation theory in physics.

Result: PGT achieves performance comparable to standard backpropagation methods in scenarios where backpropagation is impractical or impossible, demonstrated on both simulated neural networks and experimental hardware.

Conclusion: PGT is a promising approach for integrating physical reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and offers significant potential for energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense

hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Motivation: Neural PDE solvers are powerful tools for modeling complex dynamical systems, but they often face challenges such as error accumulation over long time horizons and maintaining stability and physical consistency.

Method: The authors introduce a multiscale implicit neural emulator that conditions on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations to enhance long-term prediction accuracy. The approach leverages predictions several steps ahead in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements and actively adjusts the temporal downsampling ratios to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range temporal coherence.

Result: Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics demonstrate high short-term accuracy and long-term stable forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed multiscale implicit neural emulator addresses the limitations of existing neural PDE solvers by improving long-term prediction accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: Hierarchical, server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed environments.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

### [83] [Neural MJD: Neural Non-Stationary Merton Jump Diffusion for Time Series Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04542)
*Yuanpei Gao,Qi Yan,Yan Leng,Renjie Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neural MJD, a neural network model that combines non-stationary stochastic dynamics and abrupt jumps for time series prediction. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of deep learning models in handling non-stationary data with abrupt changes by explicitly modeling underlying stochastic processes.

Method: Neural MJD formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) simulation problem, integrating time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion and compound Poisson process. A likelihood truncation mechanism is introduced to manage jumps within small time intervals, and an Euler-Maruyama with restart solver is proposed to reduce estimation error and variance.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that Neural MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical learning methods.

Conclusion: Neural MJD provides a novel approach to model non-stationary time series data with abrupt changes, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes mdQFL, a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm addressing bottlenecks in training with large datasets and numerous devices, non-IID data distributions. It reduces communication costs by nearly 50%, maintains or improves model accuracy, and enhances local model training compared to standard QFL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges of bottlenecks in federated learning caused by large datasets, many participating devices, and heterogeneity between clients (non-IID data).

Method: Introduced mdQFL - a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm that is efficient and adaptable for different numbers of devices and explores personalization in training and updates, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting.

Result: mdQFL achieved nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs while maintaining or exceeding final model accuracy and consistently improving local model training compared to standard QFL baseline.

Conclusion: mdQFL is an effective solution for addressing key challenges in quantum federated learning, offering significant improvements in efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Conclusion: A structured workflow for unsupervised learning in science can lead to more reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

### [86] [Clustering and Median Aggregation Improve Differentially Private Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04566)
*Kareem Amin,Salman Avestimehr,Sara Babakniya,Alex Bie,Weiwei Kong,Natalia Ponomareva,Umar Syed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve the quality of differentially private synthetic text generation by clustering input data and using median-based aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately generated text, especially for heterogeneous topics.

Method: Cluster the input data before selecting inference batches and aggregate next token statistics by privately computing medians instead of averages.

Result: Improvements in representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) and downstream task performance. High-quality synthetic data produced at significantly lower privacy cost than previous state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the quality of differentially private synthetic text generation while reducing privacy cost.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: StatsMerging是一种新的轻量级模型合并方法，通过权重分布统计来指导模型合并过程，无需真实标签或测试样本。它利用奇异值分解、轻量级学习器和任务特定教师蒸馏等技术，在多项任务中表现出优越的准确性、泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在受限内存预算下容纳多个大型模型的需求推动了模型合并技术的发展，但现有方法可能需要真实标签或测试样本，增加了成本和复杂性。

Method: StatsMerging方法包括：1) 使用奇异值分解(SVD)捕获任务特定权重分布以预测任务系数；2) 引入轻量级学习器StatsMergeLearner建模任务特定预训练模型的权重分布；3) 提出任务特定教师蒸馏(Task-Specific Teacher Distillation)合并异构架构视觉模型。此外，还包含两种知识蒸馏类型：从任务特定模型到StatsMergeLearner的知识蒸馏，以及在合并前从异构架构模型的知识蒸馏。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，StatsMerging在八项任务上表现有效。结果显示，与最先进的技术相比，StatsMerging在总体准确性、对未见任务的泛化能力以及对图像质量变化的鲁棒性方面具有优势。

Conclusion: StatsMerging作为一种轻量级学习型模型合并方法，成功地通过权重分布统计指导合并过程，并在无真实标签或测试样本的情况下展现出卓越性能，为模型合并领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

*Marianna Nezhurina,Tomer Porian,Giovanni Pucceti,Tommie Kerssies,Romain Beaumont,Mehdi Cherti,Jenia Jitsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling laws for CLIP and MaMMUT models to predict properties, compare models and datasets, and determine pre-training preferences. It derives full scaling laws based on dense measurements across scales, showing MaMMUT's better sample efficiency than CLIP. The study also compares various downstream tasks and datasets, observing consistent trends. Accurate derivation of scaling laws helps avoid misleading conclusions from single reference scales and promotes systematic comparison and improvement of open foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To use scaling law derivation not only for predicting the properties and performance of transferable learning models at larger scales but also for comparing different models and datasets, determining which procedure is preferred for pre-training.

Method: Deriving full scaling laws based on dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales for two language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT. Comparing both models using these derived scaling laws while ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points. Demonstrating that the comparison can be performed with a constant learning rate schedule to reduce compute cost.

Result: Evidence shows MaMMUT has stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency compared to standard CLIP. Consistent trends are observed when comparing scaling laws for various downstream tasks and different open datasets. Comparison using scaling laws avoids misleading conclusions based on measurements from single reference scales.

Conclusion: Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides a method for performing model and dataset comparison across scale spans, promoting systematic comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using bidirectional bounds (both lower and upper) for training Energy-based models (EBMs) to stabilize the process, offering four different log-likelihood bounds derived from various perspectives and demonstrating high-quality density estimation and sample generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy-based models are difficult to train due to instabilities when minimizing a lower bound during training.

Method: Propose using bidirectional bounds (maximizing a lower bound and minimizing an upper bound) for training EBMs. Investigate four different log-likelihood bounds derived from different perspectives including singular values of generator Jacobian, mutual information, gradient penalty-like bound, and one based on diffusion processes.

Result: Use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: Bidirectional bounds provide a more stable approach for training EBMs compared to only minimizing a lower bound.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效地找到近似最优的代理组合，适用于广泛的实际损失函数，并且渐进近似最优。

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

*MoonJeong Park,Sunghyun Choi,Jaeseung Heo,Eunhyeok Park,Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reevaluates the issue of oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), arguing that its impact has been exaggerated and often confused with the vanishing gradient problem. Through analysis of GNN core operations, the authors demonstrate that techniques like skip connections and normalization allow for effective deep GNN architectures without performance loss, challenging previous assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the prevailing belief that oversmoothing is a major obstacle unique to deep GNNs and to explore the potential of deeper architectures by distinguishing between oversmoothing and vanishing gradient issues.

Method: The method involves analyzing the three key operations in GNNs (aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation) to show how prior studies have mistakenly associated oversmoothing with vanishing gradients. The authors then demonstrate the effectiveness of classical solutions such as skip connections and normalization in building deep GNNs.

Result: The results indicate that oversmoothing should not be considered unique to GNNs and that deep GNN layers can be successfully stacked using established techniques without experiencing performance degradation.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the influence of oversmoothing in GNNs has been overstated, and deep GNN architectures are viable with proper design considerations, thus encouraging further exploration of deep GNNs.

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: In federated learning, datasets from different devices often violate the i.i.d. assumption. Personalizing certain parts of a model can address this but may exacerbate client drift. The paper proposes FedAPM, an FL framework based on ADMM to mitigate client drift. It constructs an augmented Lagrangian function and establishes global convergence rates. Experiments show that FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence with fewer communication rounds.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the issues in federated learning where datasets are not i.i.d. and personalizing certain parts of the model can lead to client drift, reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms.

Method: The method involves proposing an FL framework called FedAPM based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). It constructs the augmented Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal terms into the objective.

Result: The results show that FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer communication rounds.

Conclusion: FedAPM is more stable and efficient in terms of convergence compared to other FL frameworks, and it globally converges from arbitrary initial points to a stationary point with three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Motivation: 随着数据集规模和预测模型复杂性的增加，在时间序列预测的集成学习中，权衡预测精度和计算成本变得至关重要。

Method: 评估了10个基础模型和8个集成配置在两个大规模零售数据集(M5和VN1)上的表现，考虑了不同重新训练频率下的点预测和概率预测准确性。

Result: 集成方法一致地提高了预测性能，特别是在概率预测场景下。较大的、以准确性为导向的集成计算成本较高；降低重新训练频率可以显著降低成本，对精度的影响较小；小规模集成（2-3个模型）通常足够实现接近最优的结果。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计集成方法和选择合适的重新训练策略，可以获得准确、鲁棒且成本效益高的预测，适用于实际应用，并支持可持续AI的目标。

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overparameterized models have limited insight from training loss alone for generalization performance, and directly enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging.

Method: Introduced DIPNet that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer, inducing a smoother loss landscape with respect to the input.

Result: Empirical validation across a wide range of architectures and tasks showed consistent enhancement in test performance under different settings including standard, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed input projection strategy can be seamlessly integrated into existing models providing a general and effective approach for boosting generalization.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a proximal Bregman response function for GNNs to predict the influence of edge deletions and insertions without retraining, accounting for message propagation effects and relaxing convexity assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve the interpretability and robustness of graph neural networks by understanding how individual edges influence their behavior. Existing methods have limitations such as strict convexity assumptions, ignoring edge insertions, and failing to capture changes in message propagation.

Method: The authors propose a proximal Bregman response function tailored for GNNs that relaxes the convexity requirement and enables accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures. The method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions.

Result: Experiments with real-world datasets show accurate influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. The influence function is also demonstrated to be versatile in applications like graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: A new approach using a proximal Bregman response function has been developed to predict edge influences in GNNs more effectively, encompassing both deletions and insertions, and considering message propagation.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the empirical successes of reinforcement learning (RL), the mechanisms by which it improves reasoning abilities are not well understood. This drives the motivation to systematically study RLVR.

Method: The study involves developing and analyzing RLVR, demonstrating its benefits in optimizing reasoning pattern selection. Theoretical analyses on convergence and training dynamics are conducted using a simplified question-reason-answer model. Two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training are identified.

Result: RLVR-trained models prefer high-success-rate reasoning patterns while maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. Theoretical results confirm that RLVR can select the best reasoning pattern and reveal two different convergence regimes. Supervised fine-tuning before RLVR can mitigate slower optimization for weaker models.

Conclusion: This work enhances the theoretical understanding of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and provides insights into improving reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security. Traditional drought indices often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature, limiting their resolution. Current machine learning models for drought prediction have been underexplored in Bangladesh.

Method: The proposed method is a satellite data-driven machine learning framework that integrates weather data (humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. It uses unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes to classify drought severity.

Result: This approach successfully classifies drought severity into different levels, showing significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions.

Conclusion: The aptitude of machine learning models in identifying and predicting drought conditions is highlighted.

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rank-based statistical metrics have emerged as robust tools for training implicit generative models, motivating the need for improved methods with desirable mathematical properties.

Method: Introduce dual-ISL by interchanging roles in the ISL framework, creating a convex optimization problem. Analyze the rank-based discrepancy $d_K$, interpret it as an $L^2$-projection, derive bounds and rates, and extend to multivariate setting.

Result: Empirically, dual-ISL converges more rapidly, offers smoother and more stable training, and prevents mode collapse better than classical ISL and other leading methods while providing explicit density approximation.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL presents theoretical advantages that translate into practical benefits for training implicit generative models.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于损失梯度正交化的快速遗忘算法能够在保持原始模型保真度的同时有效地遗忘数据，并显著减少了遗忘时间。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

TL;DR: MGRPO, an enhancement of GRPO with a two-layer process for generating and correcting initial responses, improves training stability and significantly outperforms standard GRPO in mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the inefficiency and instability issues of the GRPO algorithm when enhancing reasoning capabilities of large language models, especially the problem of reward vanishing due to errors in complex reasoning chains.

Method: MGRPO operates in two layers. The first layer uses standard GRPO to generate an initial response. The second layer takes this response along with the original query and is trained to identify and correct errors in the initial response, creating a self-correction loop.

Result: Experimental results show that MGRPO significantly outperforms standard GRPO on several mathematical reasoning benchmarks by improving both reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Conclusion: MGRPO successfully enhances the reasoning and self-correction abilities of large language models, providing a more stable and efficient training process compared to standard GRPO.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

TL;DR: Transformer中的注意力机制对于准确且可扩展的序列建模是一个重要的基本组件。然而，其二次计算和线性内存复杂度仍然是重要瓶颈。本文提出了log-linear attention，在效率上平衡了线性注意力和softmax注意力的表现力。通过特定增长函数，log-linear attention可以用序列长度对数线性的计算成本实现类似的并行形式。作为案例研究，我们在Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet架构上实例化了log-linear变体，并发现它们相较于线性时间变体表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的注意力机制虽然强大，但其计算复杂度为二次方级别，内存复杂度为线性级别，这对大规模序列建模构成了显著瓶颈。线性注意力和状态空间模型虽然实现了线性时间和常数内存复杂度，但本质上仍是RNN，使用固定大小的隐藏状态来建模上下文存在根本限制。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的注意力机制——log-linear attention。它用以对数方式增长的隐藏状态集替代固定大小的隐藏状态，从而在效率上平衡了线性注意力和softmax注意力的表现力。此外，log-linear attention可以通过特定增长函数实现类似于矩阵乘法丰富的并行形式，其计算成本与序列长度呈对数线性关系。该方法可以应用于现有的线性注意力变体之上。

Result: 作为案例研究，log-linear attention被应用到了两个近期架构（Mamba-2和Gated DeltaNet）上。实验结果表明，这些log-linear变体相较于它们的线性时间变体表现出色。

Conclusion: Log-linear attention提供了一个通用框架，可以在效率和表现力之间取得良好的平衡。它适用于现有线性注意力变体，并能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive benchmark and library for Graph Transformers.

Method: Introduced OpenGT, a benchmark that enables fair comparisons and multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs.

Result: Uncovered critical insights including model transfer difficulty, local attention limitations, efficiency trade-offs, positional encoding applications, and preprocessing overhead.

Conclusion: Established a foundation for future graph transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and generalizability.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph

Motivation: 研究具有有限$(1+\epsilon)$-绝对中心矩的重尾奖励的随机线性Bandit问题，目标是改善关于维度$d$和时间$T$的遗憾界的依赖关系。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于消除的算法，该算法由实验设计指导，并针对有限动作集推导出类似的改进的遗憾上界和下界。对于某些几何形状（如$l_p$-范数球），可以进一步减少对$d$的依赖，并通过核技巧处理无限维设置。

Result: 新算法实现了遗憾界$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$，严格改进了下界为$\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$，并首次建立了Mat\'ern核的次线性遗憾界。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个新的消除算法，严格改进了重尾随机线性Bandit问题的遗憾界，并揭示了此类问题的难度。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the connection between two prominent Vector Quantization techniques - k-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation - through the lens of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization.

Method: Compare a heuristic QUBO formulation for k-medoids with a principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based VQ.

Result: Showed that KDE-QUBO is a special case of k-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map.

Conclusion: Revealed a deeper structural relationship between k-medoids and KDE approaches and provided new insight into the geometric interpretation of weighting parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes during neural network training.

Method: Identify a critical regime where squared gradients become much smaller than second-order moment estimates, causing sluggish response to current gradient information and inducing instability.

Result: Through extensive experiments on various network architectures, it is verified that this mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the preconditioned Hessian beyond the stability threshold, leading to loss spikes.

Conclusion: Adam's adaptive preconditioners can trigger loss spikes by pushing the maximum eigenvalue of the preconditioned Hessian beyond the stability threshold.

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 通过强化学习在逻辑谜题上微调大语言模型，可以显著提高其结构化推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在许多监督任务中表现出色，但在不熟悉的环境下的结构化推理方面仍然存在困难。这表明标准的微调流程可能灌输了狭窄的、特定领域的启发式算法，而不是促进通用的思考策略。

Method: 提出了一种“玩中学”的框架，通过强化学习在七个定制的逻辑谜题套件上微调大语言模型，这些谜题旨在培养不同的推理技能，例如约束传播、空间一致性和符号演绎。使用具有可验证奖励的强化学习设置，模型根据谜题正确性获得二元反馈，鼓励迭代和假设驱动的问题解决。

Result: 这种训练方法显著提高了在数学基准测试中的分布外性能，特别是对于需要多步推理的中等难度问题。跨问题类别和难度级别的分析显示，谜题训练促进了可转移的推理程序，增强了代数操作、几何推断和组合逻辑的能力，但在死记硬背或高度专业化的任务上收益有限。

Conclusion: 强化学习在逻辑谜题上的应用重塑了大语言模型的内部推理机制，实现了更强大和组合性的泛化，而不依赖于特定任务的符号工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for managing and interpreting patient data are insufficient as they focus on narrow use cases with limited feature space, ignoring complex longitudinal interactions needed for personalized care.

Result: EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance in next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming competitive baselines and enabling detailed simulations of patient trajectories for various evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: EHR2Path opens a path towards predictive and personalized healthcare by effectively predicting future health trajectories and simulating patient pathways.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

### [112] [Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859)
*Yin Lu,Tong He,Xuening Zhu,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in traditional sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), proposing a hybrid model that overcomes these issues. Theoretical proofs and empirical evaluations show its effectiveness in modeling structured data, estimating manifold dimensions, and producing sparser latent representations without increasing reconstruction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underappreciated weaknesses in canonical SAEs and VAEs, particularly in their ability to model structured data across manifolds, produce sparser latent representations, and accurately estimate underlying manifold dimensions.

Method: Proposes a hybrid alternative model combining elements from both SAEs and VAEs, which is theoretically proven to recover certain forms of structured data spread across a union of manifolds.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate superior performance compared to equivalent-capacity SAEs, VAEs, and recent diffusion models in accurately estimating manifold dimensions, producing sparser latent representations, and maintaining low reconstruction error.

Conclusion: The hybrid model offers an effective solution for modeling structured data, with theoretical support and strong empirical results indicating its potential advantages in domains like images and language model activation patterns.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Sameer Khurana,Ricard Marxer,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores why contrastive losses are ineffective in learning aligned multimodal representation spaces due to modality-specific information. It provides a theoretical explanation using the Information Bottleneck Principle, an empirical analysis of influencing hyperparameters, and proposes a regularization term derived via variational approximation to enhance representational alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive losses have been found to be ineffective for learning aligned multimodal representation spaces despite their widespread use. This ineffectiveness is attributed to the presence of modality-specific information in the representation space.

Method: The authors theoretically describe the problem using the Information Bottleneck Principle, empirically analyze the impact of different hyperparameters on the phenomenon through controlled experiments, and propose a regularization term in the loss function derived by variational approximation to improve representational alignment.

Result: Through controlled experiments and real-world applications, the inclusion of the proposed regularization term shows advantages in increasing representational alignment.

Conclusion: Modality-specific information hinders the effectiveness of contrastive losses in aligning multimodal representations. The proposed regularization term offers a solution to this issue, improving alignment in both experimental settings and practical applications.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

### [114] [There Was Never a Bottleneck in Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04877)
*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which use an Information Bottleneck objective to constrain each representation component to retain only information relevant to its corresponding concept. This addresses limitations of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that don't truly impose a bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve the interpretability and validity of intervention procedures in deep learning models by addressing the shortcomings of existing Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs). CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck as their components may encode more information than just about their corresponding concepts.

Method: The method proposed in this paper is the development of Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs). These models incorporate an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective into the training process, adding a variational regularization term to the loss function. This constrains each representation component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.

Result: The result of implementing MCBMs is that they support concept-level interventions with theoretical guarantees, align with Bayesian principles, and offer greater flexibility in key design choices compared to traditional CBMs.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn from this work is that Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) provide a significant improvement over previous methods by ensuring that each component of the model's representation encodes only the necessary information for its corresponding concept, thereby enhancing interpretability and the validity of interventions.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a pipeline using GPDSSM for semi-automated classification of hip dysplasia from CT scans, improving accuracy and efficiency over traditional angle-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of hip dysplasia is crucial for reducing the risk of osteoarthritis (OA), but current angle-based methods are time-consuming and less accurate.

Method: Developed a Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM) that uses volumetric CT scans and clinically annotated landmarks to create a statistical shape model for classifying dysplasia.

Result: GPDSSM effectively distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls with an AUC of 96.2%, higher than angle-based methods at 91.2%. It also highlights regions showing dysplastic variations.

Conclusion: GPDSSM not only improves classification accuracy but also saves clinician's time by automating the process and removing the need for manual measurements.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial but challenging due to the complexity of clinical data.

Method: ALFIA jointly trains LoRA adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting mechanism with a BERT backbone to fuse multi-layer semantic features. It can be paired with GBDTs or deep neural networks for additional performance gains.

Result: ALFIA surpasses state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while maintaining a balanced precision-recall profile. Experiments confirm its superior early-warning performance.

Conclusion: ALFIA provides a robust tool for clinicians to perform risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings by processing routine clinical text.

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

Motivation: To address the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0 and align automation systems with the principles of Industry 5.0.

Method: The framework integrates Agentic AI with intent-based processing, allowing human operators to express high-level goals in natural language which are decomposed into actionable components guiding specialized agents.

Result: A proof of concept implementation using CMAPSS dataset and Google ADK demonstrated the feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach shows potential to reduce technical barriers for scalable, intent-driven automation but raises concerns about data quality and explainability.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,

TL;DR: FPTQuant introduces four novel function-preserving transforms to facilitate quantization of transformers, enabling static INT4 quantization with minimal overhead and showing SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models require substantial compute and energy at inference time. Quantizing weights and activations can improve efficiency, but naive quantization can significantly degrade performance due to large magnitude outliers.

Method: FPTQuant introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: a mergeable pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, a mergeable transform for values, a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and a cheap, dynamic scaling transform.

Result: FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP. It has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off, performing on par or exceeding most prior work.

Conclusion: FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and full-precision models match.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

Motivation: 近期的研究表明，自适应控制学习速率可以加速无悔学习，这启发了作者探索这一现象是否具有普遍性，并开发出更通用、更高效的加速学习方法。

Method: 引入了Cautious Optimism框架，它以任何FTRL实例为输入，通过调节学习速率输出加速的无悔学习算法，同时保持解耦特性（学习者无需了解其他玩家的效用函数）。

Result: Cautious Optimistic FTRL在多样化的自我对弈中实现了接近最优的$O_T(\log T)$后悔值，在对抗场景中保留了最优的$O(\sqrt{T})$后悔值，且不依赖单调步长。

Conclusion: Cautious Optimism框架提供了一种新的快速学习路径，适用于一般博弈中的无悔学习，且计算开销极小。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a model that explicitly encodes concept-concept and concept-task relationships to enforce desired reasoning, while maintaining high concept importance and competitive task performance.

Method: CREAM embeds directed concept-concept and concept-task relationships specified by human experts, severs undesired information flows, and integrates a regularized black-box side-channel used only when necessary to enhance performance.

Result: Experiments indicate that CREAM relies mainly on concepts, achieves task performance comparable to black-box models, and eases model interventions while mitigating concept leakage.

Conclusion: CREAM successfully enforces desired model reasoning through encoded relationships, maintains high concept importance, and achieves competitive task performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

*John Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding, a method for transforming vector-mode geospatial data into a form suitable for machine learning. MPP outperforms rasterization-based methods in representing shapes and capturing spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to encode vector-mode geospatial data (points, lines, polygons) into a format that can be used with traditional machine learning models.

Method: MPP encoding uses scaled distances from a shape to a set of reference points within a region of interest to represent the shape as a vector capturing its essential geometric properties.

Result: MPP encoding demonstrates shape-centricity, continuity, differentiation of spatial objects based on geometric features, and high-precision capture of pairwise spatial relationships. It performs better than an alternative rasterization-based method.

Conclusion: MPP encoding is an effective method for parameterizing machine learning models with encoded representations of vector-mode geospatial features.

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

Propose PartialCLIP, an efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Use text-embedding classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using zero-shot CLIP.

Result: Current PLL approaches achieve significant performance gains when using foundation models, exhibit similar performance to each other, maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels, but are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation strategies.

Conclusion: The experimental results and analysis reveal the limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for developing more generalizable PLL models.

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

### [124] [TIMING: Temporality-Aware Integrated Gradients for Time Series Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05035)
*Hyeongwon Jang,Changhun Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In order to solve the problem that existing time series XAI methods cannot effectively identify positive and negative impact points, this paper proposes new evaluation indicators CPD and CPP, and finds that IG performs better under these indicators. However, directly applying IG to time series data has shortcomings, so the paper proposes TIMING, which is more suitable for time series data and performs better in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series XAI methods can only estimate point-by-point attribution intensity and ignore directional impact, resulting in suboptimal identification of important points. At the same time, current evaluation indicators cannot well evaluate the ability of attribution methods to identify positive and negative impact points.

Method: Propose new evaluation indicators CPD and CPP to assess whether attribution methods can accurately identify positive and negative impact points; propose TIMING method, which enhances IG by adding time awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.

Result: Under the new evaluation indicators CPD and CPP, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts; extensive experiments show that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines.

Conclusion: TIMING is an improved method based on IG, which adds time awareness while maintaining the theoretical properties of IG, and performs better in identifying significant positive and negative points in time series XAI.

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

### [125] [iN2V: Bringing Transductive Node Embeddings to Inductive Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05039)
*Nicolas Lell,Ansgar Scherp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces inductive node2vec (iN2V), an extension of node2vec that allows for computing embeddings of unseen nodes during training, thus transitioning from a transductive to an inductive setting. This approach improves node classification accuracy and can be integrated with other embedding methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shallow node embedding methods like node2vec are restricted to the transductive setting, where all nodes, including test nodes, must be available during training. This limitation reduces their applicability on new or unseen nodes.

Method: The authors propose iN2V which includes a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes not seen during training and modifications to the original N2V training process to prepare for this procedure.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that iN2V effectively brings transductive embeddings into an inductive setting, improving node classification by 1 point on average and up to 6 points depending on the dataset and number of unseen nodes.

Conclusion: iN2V is a versatile plug-in approach that can create new or enrich existing embeddings and can be combined with other embedding methods, advancing inductive node representation learning.

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to

*Viet Nguyen Changjian Shui,Vijay Giri,Siddarth Arya,Amol Verma,Fahad Razak,Rahul G. Krishnan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces D3M, an algorithm for monitoring post-deployment deterioration (PDD) in machine learning models. It uses model disagreement to identify when retraining is needed without requiring labels, providing low false positive rates and high true positive rates under deteriorating shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Models operating in dynamic environments require retraining as data distributions change over time. However, determining the optimal time for retraining without access to labels remains a significant challenge. Not all data shifts lead to performance degradation, necessitating a method that can distinguish between harmful and harmless shifts.

Method: The proposed method, D3M, is based on the disagreement of predictive models. It monitors post-deployment deterioration by analyzing changes in predictions without needing labels. The algorithm provides sample complexity bounds to ensure high true positive rates while maintaining low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts.

Result: Empirical results show the effectiveness of D3M on both standard benchmarks and a real-world large-scale internal medicine dataset. The framework demonstrates its potential as an alert mechanism for critical machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: D3M offers a practical and efficient solution for monitoring post-deployment deterioration in machine learning models. By distinguishing between harmful and harmless data shifts, it provides valuable insights into when retraining is necessary, enhancing the reliability of machine learning systems.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

*Shijian Xu,Marcello Massimo Negri,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks are hard to interpret while linear models are less expressive but interpretable. This paper introduces NIMO, a model that combines both by allowing a neural network to learn nonlinear corrections to linear model predictions while maintaining the interpretability of linear coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a model that combines the predictive power of neural networks with the interpretability of linear models.

Method: Define a model (NIMO) where a neural network learns nonlinear corrections to linear model predictions while keeping the interpretability of linear coefficients. Develop an optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood and use adaptive ridge regression to incorporate sparsity constraints.

Result: Empirically recover the underlying linear coefficients and significantly improve predictive accuracy. Achieve higher performance in various regression and classification settings compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches.

Conclusion: NIMO is the only model that maintains the same interpretability of linear coefficients as in linear models while improving predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

TL;DR: 扩展HiPPO理论以处理含噪声数据，提出了一种不确定性感知的状态空间模型动力学初始化方法，提高了模型对噪声的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HiPPO框架假设数据无噪声，但实际中这一假设往往被违反，因此需要一种能够处理含噪声数据的初始化方法。

Method: 将HiPPO解释为一个线性随机控制问题，并将其重新表述为一个数据为隐系统噪声输出的问题，从而推导出一种从数据中推断隐系统后验的替代动力学初始化方法。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的初始化方法提高了状态空间模型在训练和推理阶段对噪声的抵抗力。

Conclusion: 提出了一个考虑测量噪声的HiPPO理论扩展，并提供了一种新的、不增加运行时间的动力学初始化方法，有效改善了状态空间模型应对噪声的能力。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

*Tobias Pielok,Bernd Bischl,David Rügamer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a kernelized KL divergence estimator with nonparametric smoothing and importance sampling correction for stabilizing and accelerating training in semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI). It connects theoretically to Stein variational gradient descent and demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art SIVI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in semi-implicit variational inference can be challenging due to high variance and bias, especially in high-dimensional settings. Current methods like Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational Inference (KSIVI) work but remain moderately expensive.

Method: The authors propose a kernelized KL divergence estimator that incorporates nonparametric smoothing to stabilize training. They also introduce an importance sampling correction to reduce bias. Furthermore, they establish a theoretical connection to the amortized version of Stein variational gradient descent.

Result: Empirical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms or matches state-of-the-art SIVI methods in terms of both performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: The new kernelized KL divergence estimator with nonparametric smoothing and importance sampling correction provides a more stable and efficient optimization approach for semi-implicit variational inference.

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

TL;DR: This paper explores the connections between generative diffusion models and continuous-state associative memory models, focusing on Morse-Smale dynamical systems as universal approximators. It describes how these systems transition from generation to memory as noise levels decrease and establishes stability criteria for diffusions at vanishing noise levels.

Motivation: To study the relationship and universal properties between generative diffusion models and continuous-state associative memory models using Morse-Smale dynamical systems.

Method: Using Morse-Smale dynamical systems as universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof.

Result: Established a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels based on structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows. Characterized stable learning landscapes with generic bifurcations in the zero-noise limit.

Conclusion: Illustrated the characterization of learning landscapes through sequences of bifurcations and provided structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks.

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method called TreeRPO that enhances the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by estimating mathematical expectations of rewards at various reasoning steps using tree sampling. This approach improves upon existing methods by providing fine-grained and dense reward signals, leading to better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of current reinforcement learning methods for LLMs, where rewards defined at the full trajectory level do not provide enough guidance for optimizing intermediate reasoning steps.

Method: TreeRPO estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various reasoning steps using tree sampling. It computes rewards based on step-level groups generated during this process, building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of GRPO.

Result: Experimental results show that TreeRPO improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math from 19.0% to 35.5%. It also outperforms GRPO by 2.9% in performance while reducing the average response length by 18.1%.

Conclusion: TreeRPO provides a significant enhancement in both the performance and efficiency of LLMs by offering more detailed reward signals through its innovative approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which addresses diminishing positive signals in diffusion-based re-ranking methods by using a long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate manifold distance measurement. LPMT integrates diffusion processes through Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion (BCD), encodes instances via Locality State Embedding (LSE), and connects distributions using the Thermodynamic Markovian Transition (TMT) process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods have issues where positive signals diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing discriminative power beyond local regions.

Method: The LPMT framework employs a long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate manifold distance measurement. It first integrates diffusion processes across separate graphs using BCD to establish strong similarity relationships, then LSE encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local consistency, and finally TMT interconnects these distributions enabling efficient global retrieval while maintaining local effectiveness.

Result: Experimental results across diverse tasks confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

Conclusion: LPMT framework is effective in addressing the issue of diminishing positive signals in diffusion-based re-ranking methods and accurately measuring manifold distances.

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a

processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Neural Networks suffer from degree bias in node classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with different degrees. Current Graph Contrastive Learning methods still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.

Method: The Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss is proposed to add more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and adaptively weight positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness. Also, the SHARP experimental framework is developed to extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios.

Result: Theoretical analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. Experimental results across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against baselines at both global and degree levels.

Conclusion: HAR contrastive loss and SHARP framework can effectively mitigate degree bias in Graph Neural Networks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within RKHS, establishing its learning theory and convergence analysis, while deriving high confidence convergence bounds and selection rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression that differs from existing divide-and-conquer based schemes.

Method: Utilizing a networked system represented as a connected graph and a robust loss function induced by a windowing function and a robustness scaling parameter, the proposed algorithm is analyzed in terms of learning theory and convergence.

Result: Each local robust estimator generated can approximate the regression function. High confidence convergence bounds are derived for each local approximating sequence. Optimal learning rates can be achieved under properly selected step size and scaling parameter.

Conclusion: The decentralization, sample selection, robustness, and convergence of the algorithm are intrinsically connected, with the parameter σ being essential for enhancing robustness and ensuring favorable convergence behavior.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Result: 在决策树模型的小、中维度数据集上，使用较少样本量即可达到低均方误差；在MNIST和CIFAR10等高维数据集上表现优于现有的KernelSHAP库。

Conclusion: 提出的框架首次为KernelSHAP提供了理论保障，并揭示了现有估计器之间的权衡；改进后的实现方法在不同维度的数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

### [138] [Diagonal Batching Unlocks Parallelism in Recurrent Memory Transformers for Long Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05229)
*Danil Sivtsov,Ivan Rodkin,Gleb Kuzmin,Yuri Kuratov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer模型在长上下文推理中面临挑战，RMTs提供了解决方案但存在性能瓶颈。本文提出Diagonal Batching调度方案，在保持精确递归的同时解锁RMTs中的并行性，大幅提升推理速度和效率，无需重新训练模型。实验表明，该方法在131,072标记序列上显著优于标准全注意力LLaMA-1B和顺序RMT实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长上下文时由于时间复杂度为二次方、内存复杂度为线性而表现不佳。RMTs虽然将成本降至线性时间和恒定内存使用，但其内存更新机制导致顺序执行，形成性能瓶颈。因此需要一种方法来解决这一问题，提升推理效率。

Method: 提出了一种名为Diagonal Batching的调度方案，该方案通过在RMTs的段之间解锁并行性，同时保留精确递归，消除了顺序约束。这种方法可以在不使用复杂的批量处理和管道技术的情况下，实现高效的GPU推理，并且无需对现有RMT模型进行重新训练。

Result: 将Diagonal Batching应用于LLaMA-1B ARMT模型后，在131,072标记序列上，相比标准全注意力LLaMA-1B实现了3.3倍的速度提升，相比顺序RMT实现实现了1.8倍的速度提升。这表明该方法能够有效减少推理成本和延迟。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching通过消除顺序瓶颈，降低了推理成本和延迟，增强了RMTs作为实际长上下文应用场景的解决方案的实用性。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PTSD, a sampler combining PT and diffusion models for efficient sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural samplers are less efficient than PT in target evaluations but can produce uncorrelated samples. PT generates dependent samples and incurs high computational costs when rerunning.

Method: PTSD trains diffusion models progressively across temperatures using PT advantages. It combines high-temperature models to approximate lower-temperature samples refined by MCMC.

Result: PTSD enhances target evaluation efficiency and surpasses existing diffusion-based neural samplers.

Conclusion: PTSD effectively reuses sample information, generating uncorrelated samples with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable version of the Mesa layer for language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. It minimizes an in-context loss optimally at every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sequence modeling is dominated by causal transformer architectures that use softmax self-attention but these require scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. Recent RNN models have constant memory and compute costs but this work aims to improve their performance further.

Method: The authors introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable version of the Mesa layer which stems from an in-context loss minimized to optimality at every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver.

Result: This approach reaches lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance than previous RNNs, particularly on tasks requiring long context understanding. However, it requires additional flops during inference time.

Conclusion: The results are intriguingly related to recent trends of increasing test-time compute to improve performance by solving sequential optimization problems within the neural network itself.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

*Valérie Costa,Thomas Fel,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Bahareh Tolooshams,Demba Ba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are criticial for interpretability, but current shallow architectures rely on a quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits their ability to extract correlated features. This paper introduces a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE) which can extract correlated features and guarantee monotonic improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in extracting interpretable features from neural representations, particularly in controlled settings such as MNIST dataset, where the limitation of quasi-orthogonality assumption in current shallow architectures is revealed.

Method: The paper proposes a novel approach called multi-iteration SAE by unrolling Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE). It allows residual-guided extraction of correlated features which arise in hierarchical settings like handwritten digit generation while ensuring monotonic improvement of reconstruction with more selected atoms.

Result: The MP-SAE method successfully overcomes the limitation of quasi-orthogonality assumption and provides better feature extraction for correlated features in hierarchical data structures.

Conclusion: The introduction of MP-SAE extends the capability of SAEs beyond the limitations of shallow architectures, providing a promising direction for improving interpretability in deep learning models.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

*Yizhuo Li,Yuying Ge,Yixiao Ge,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to arbitrary target distributions by using flow-based generative models as priors. The method pretrains a flow model, regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, and avoids computationally expensive likelihood evaluations or ODE solving. It proves that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of this paper is to develop a more efficient and effective way to align latent spaces with target distributions without relying on computationally expensive methods such as likelihood evaluations or ODE solving.

Method: The method involves pretraining a flow model on target features, then using this fixed flow model to regularize the latent space via an alignment loss. This reformulates the flow matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets.

Result: The proposed method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids ODE solving during optimization. In controlled settings, the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. Large-scale image generation experiments on ImageNet validate the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: With both theoretical and empirical validation, the presented framework provides a new approach for latent space alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

TL;DR: Transformer模型尽管在应用中表现出色，但其训练动态的理论基础尚不完善。本文通过分析单层Transformer的收敛行为，发现梯度下降在线性收敛率下进行，并揭示残差连接改善输出矩阵条件的作用。同时，理论结果被扩展至多层Transformer架构并得到实证支持。


<details>

Motivation: 当前对Transformer的研究多集中于单独组件，而缺乏对其内部组件间相互依赖关系的深入探讨，尤其是在存在残差连接的情况下。

Method: 研究一个包含自注意力、前馈网络和残差连接的单层完整Transformer结构的收敛行为；分析初始化条件下梯度下降的收敛特性以及残差连接对优化稳定性的影响；将结果推广到多层Transformer架构。

Result: 证明了适当初始化下的梯度下降具有线性收敛率，且收敛速度由注意力层输出矩阵的最小和最大奇异值决定；残差连接改善了由softmax操作引起的低秩结构导致的病态问题，从而提高了优化稳定性。实证结果验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析和实证研究揭示了残差连接在Transformer模型中的重要性，为理解其训练动态提供了新视角，并为进一步改进Transformer架构奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) benefit from physics-grounded paradigms. This paper proposes Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm that computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. RHEL only requires three 'forward passes' and avoids explicit Jacobian computation or variance in gradient estimation. The paper introduces RHEL in continuous time, demonstrates its equivalence with the continuous adjoint state method, and proposes a discrete-time version equivalent to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). RHEL is scalable and can be generalized to Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). It matches BPTT performance across various models and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work stems from the need for learning algorithms in Deep State Space Models (SSMs) that adhere to core physical principles. These algorithms should efficiently simulate dynamical systems and guide their design, particularly for non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems.

Method: The method involves proposing Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), which provably computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of Hamiltonian systems. The approach includes introducing RHEL in continuous time, demonstrating its equivalence with the continuous adjoint state method, and proposing a discrete-time version equivalent to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs).

Result: RHEL consistently matches the performance of BPTT across all models and tasks, including those with sequence lengths reaching approximately 50k. This demonstrates its scalability and effectiveness in training Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs) with both linear and nonlinear dynamics.

Conclusion: This work highlights the potential of RHEL for designing scalable, energy-efficient physical systems with self-learning capabilities for sequence modeling. It opens new avenues for advancements in the field of deep learning and dynamical systems.

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

TL;DR: In the artificial intelligence industry, protecting the value and copyright of training data is important. This paper proposes Fast-DataShapley to solve the problem of fairly rewarding data providers without incurring excessive computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to find a way to fairly reward data providers for their contributions while avoiding the high computational overhead associated with calculating Shapley values.

Method: The method proposed is Fast-DataShapley, which uses weighted least squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer model with real-time reasoning speed. Additionally, three methods with theoretical guarantees are proposed to reduce training overhead.

Result: Experimental evaluations show superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines. Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times and the explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley provides an efficient way to calculate Shapley values without retraining for each test sample, significantly improving both performance and explainer training speed.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Motivation: Machine learning techniques typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly represented in the training data, especially without explicit structural priors.

Method: A multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers was developed, which supports training across a collection of disjoint time series. This enables effective use of available training data.

Result: Reservoir computers trained on this scheme can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Conclusion: Reservoir computing offers an effective approach to modeling dynamical systems from observed data and can generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Method: 提出了一种名为SAILOR的方法，通过从专家演示中学习搜索（L2S），结合世界模型和奖励模型，在测试时规划以匹配专家结果，即使犯错也能恢复。该方法经过多种算法和设计决策的消融研究，以实现稳定且高效的恢复行为学习，无需额外的人工纠正。

Result: 在来自三个基准的十几个视觉操控任务中，SAILOR的表现始终优于基于相同数据训练的最先进的扩散策略。即使将用于BC的演示数量增加5-10倍，性能差距仍然存在。此外，SAILOR能够识别细微的失败并对奖励欺骗具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAILOR通过学习搜索方法克服了行为克隆的局限性，展现了在复杂任务中的优越性能和鲁棒性。代码已公开。

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

TL;DR: 研究了大规模语言模型在复杂任务上的测试时策略的样本效率，通过理论分析和实验证明了不同方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管测试时扩展范式显著提高了大规模语言模型在复杂任务上的能力，但对各种测试时策略（如自一致性、最佳-of-$n$和自我纠正）的样本效率的理论理解仍然有限。

Method: 首先建立了两个重复采样策略之间的分离结果：自一致性需要Θ(1/Δ^2)样本才能产生正确答案，而最佳-of-$n$只需要Θ(1/Δ)，其中Δ<1表示正确答案与第二可能答案之间的概率差距；然后提出了带有验证者反馈的自我纠正方法的表达性结果：它使Transformer能够在测试时模拟在线学习一个专家池；最后，通过实验验证了理论结果，展示了自我纠正方法的实际有效性。

Result: 理论和实验证明了最佳-of-$n$策略比自一致性策略更有效，自我纠正方法能够使单一Transformer架构解决多个任务，无需事先了解与用户查询相关的特定任务。

Conclusion: 不同的测试时策略具有不同的样本效率，自我纠正方法具有较高的表达性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

*Nirav Koley,Prajwal Singhania,Abhinav Bhatele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient GPU inference with large language models is challenging due to memory bandwidth limitations. SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method, addresses this by replacing top-k operations with an element-wise filtering operation based on a dynamic threshold value estimated per prompt at each generation step. This reduces data movement between HBM and SRAM while preserving model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient inference using large language models on GPUs is hindered by memory bandwidth limitations, especially during data transfers in attention computations. Existing approximate attention methods reduce computational and memory overhead but rely on expensive top-k operations that perform poorly on GPUs.

Method: SiftAttention proposes a computationally efficient element-wise filtering operation based on a threshold value to replace the top-k step. The threshold value is dynamically estimated per prompt at each generation step based on the observation that the τ-th quantile of attention scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.

Result: SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when loading value vectors.

Conclusion: SiftAttention offers a promising approach for more efficient inference on GPUs by significantly reducing memory bandwidth usage without compromising model quality.

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

*Florentin Guth,Zahra Kadkhodaie,Eero P Simoncelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework for learning normalized energy models inspired by diffusion generative models, modifies score network architecture to compute energy while preserving inductive biases, and trains an energy network on ImageNet64 with a dual score matching objective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning probability models from data is difficult due to the curse of dimensionality. Traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a low-dimensional manifold may not hold true.

Method: The authors introduce a framework for learning normalized energy (log probability) models inspired by diffusion generative models. They modify a score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is the score of the learned density, optimized using a denoising objective. Additionally, they optimize the gradient with respect to the noise level with a novel secondary objective.

Result: The energy network was trained on the ImageNet64 dataset with a dual score matching objective and achieved a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable to the state of the art. The approach demonstrates strong generalization, with estimated log probabilities nearly independent of specific training set images. It also shows that image probability and dimensionality of local neighborhoods vary significantly with image content.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully learns normalized energy models, achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet64, and challenges traditional assumptions about image data.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

TL;DR: This paper proposes two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning, reducing time by 25%-65% compared to the original GRPO algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning for large language models is resource-intensive and lacks focus on data efficiency.

Method: The paper introduces difficulty-targeted online data selection with adaptive difficulty and a rollout replay mechanism to reuse recent rollouts.

Result: Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show a reduction in RL fine-tuning time by 25%-65% while maintaining performance levels.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques effectively enhance data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: The paper presents LSM-2 with AIM, a new SSL method using learnable mask tokens to handle incomplete wearable sensor data without explicit imputation. Pre-trained on 40M hours of data, it excels in various tasks and missingness scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning models typically require complete data, but wearable sensor data often has significant missingness which poses challenges.

Method: Introduced LSM-2 with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), utilizing learnable mask tokens for both existing and artificial missingness in data, enabling robust handling of incomplete data.

Result: Achieves best performance across classification, regression, and generative modeling tasks, shows superior scaling performance, and maintains high performance under targeted missingness scenarios.

Conclusion: AIM is a reliable choice for real-world wearable data applications, demonstrating clinically coherent patterns such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension prediction.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

TL;DR: The paper presents an AI-based framework for extracting the single-scatterer QPI pattern from multi-scatterer images using a two-step learning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is crucial for probing electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer QPI pattern from a multi-scatterer image remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem.

Method: A two-step learning strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from observation-to-kernel inference. Firstly, train a variational autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. Secondly, align the latent representation of QPI observations with those of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significantly higher extraction accuracy and improved generalization to unseen kernels compared to a direct one-step baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed AI-based framework achieves robust kernel inference even under complex, entangled scattering conditions.

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

*Ranajoy Sadhukhan,Zhuoming Chen,Haizhong Zheng,Yang Zhou,Emma Strubell,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reconsiders test-time scaling laws focusing on practical efficiency, revealing smaller models' effectiveness is overestimated. It introduces the Kinetics Scaling Law which incorporates computation and memory access costs, suggesting test-time compute is more effective for larger models due to attention being a dominant cost factor. A new scaling paradigm using sparse attention is proposed, showing consistent performance improvements over dense models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective, addressing overlooked memory access bottlenecks in prior work focused on compute-optimality.

Method: Conducting a holistic analysis of models ranging from 0.6B to 32B parameters, discovering the Kinetics Scaling Law that considers both computation and memory access costs. Proposing a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse attention to reduce per-token cost and enable longer generations within the same resource budget.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense counterparts, achieving significant gains in problem-solving accuracy on AIME across different cost regimes. This highlights the importance of sparse attention for realizing full potential of test-time scaling.

Conclusion: Sparse attention is crucial for maximizing test-time scaling potential as it continues to improve accuracy through increased generation, unlike training where parameter scaling saturates.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes grafting, a method for editing pretrained diffusion transformers to explore new architecture designs with low compute cost. It demonstrates hybrid designs achieving good quality using minimal pretraining compute and successfully applies grafting to a text-to-image model for performance improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing model architectures involves making decisions about operators and configurations, but evaluating these decisions typically requires costly pretraining which limits architectural investigation. The authors ask if new architecture designs can be studied using pretrained models to reduce the computational cost.

Method: The authors present grafting, an approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to realize new architectures under small compute budgets. They analyze activation behavior and attention locality to construct a testbed based on the DiT-XL/2 design. Through this testbed, they develop hybrid designs by replacing components such as softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.

Result: Many hybrid designs achieved good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for DiT-XL/2) using less than 2% of the pretraining compute. Grafting was also applied to a text-to-image model (PixArt-Sigma), resulting in a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval score. Additionally, restructuring DiT-XL/2 via grafting reduced model depth by 2x and yielded better quality (FID: 2.77).

Conclusion: Grafting allows exploration of new diffusion model designs with edits ranging from operator replacement to architecture restructuring while maintaining high model quality and significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Through compressing the KV cache with Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), the paper achieves inference-time hyper-scaling that improves reasoning accuracy of Transformer LLMs without increasing compute budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time scaling in Transformer LLMs is limited by the size of the key-value (KV) cache rather than the number of generated tokens. Thus, there's a need for an approach to generate more tokens within the same compute budget to further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.

Method: The paper introduces Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches which allows 8× compression with only 1K training steps. DMS delays token eviction, merging representations and preserving critical information instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens.

Result: DMS boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load across multiple families of LLMs. For example, Qwen-R1 32B is enhanced by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across various compute budgets.

Conclusion: Inference-time hyper-scaling through KV cache compression with DMS is effective in improving the accuracy of Transformer LLMs without increasing the compute budget.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

Motivation: To understand the potential misuse of IPFS by malicious actors who can upload and disseminate harmful content while remaining anonymous.

Method: Evaluate the role of pinning services and public gateways in maintaining content availability, and systematically test their behavior using scripts to upload malicious files.

Result: Pinning services and public gateways do not have adequate mechanisms to assess or restrict the propagation of malicious content on IPFS.

questions about potential misuse. In this study, we explore methods that
malicious actors can exploit IPFS to upload and disseminate harmful content

availability. Using scripts, we systematically test the behavior of these

### [161] [The Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR) Problem: From Symbolic Path Inversion to Post-Quantum Cryptographic Keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04383)
*Mohamed Aly Bouke*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR) problem, a new cryptographic construction based on symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. It uses fractal behavior and hash-based entropy amplification to provide post-quantum security without algebraic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical cryptographic systems are becoming vulnerable due to quantum attacks and structural cryptanalysis, necessitating new approaches that do not rely on structured algebraic problems.

Method: The HFKR problem is built upon the Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), utilizing symbolic trajectories generated by contractive affine maps over Z^2. These trajectories are compressed into fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash functions. The fractal nature of these paths is confirmed empirically.

Result: Experimental results indicate that the used hash functions effectively amplify symbolic divergence, achieving high Hamming distances and ideal bit-flip rates. BLAKE3 shows weaker diffusion compared to SHA3-512 and SHAKE256. The fractal dimension stabilizes near 1.06, supporting the complexity and self-similarity of the scheme.

Conclusion: HFKR provides a lightweight, structure-free foundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings, leveraging the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy amplification for post-quantum security.

Abstract: Classical cryptographic systems rely heavily on structured algebraic
problems, such as factorization, discrete logarithms, or lattice-based
assumptions, which are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks and
structural cryptanalysis. In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal
Key Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction
grounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the
Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories
generated via contractive affine maps over $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them
into fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key
contribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic
paths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path
geometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension
increases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic
self-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the
entropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation
trials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively,
achieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible
entropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but
weaker diffusion. These findings confirm that HFKR post-quantum security arises
from the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy
amplification. The resulting construction offers a lightweight, structure-free
foundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings without relying on
algebraic hardness assumptions.

TL;DR: RAG系统容易受到注入毒化段落的攻击，现有攻击虽可检测但需更隐秘。本文提出基于注意力模式的方法来过滤毒化段落，并设计更隐秘的攻击测试防御极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的针对RAG系统的攻击不够隐秘，可以通过差异性分析进行检测和缓解。因此需要研究如何通过深入分析生成过程中的信号（如注意力模式或下一个词的概率分布）来避免明显的操纵痕迹。

Method: 1. 提出了一种段落级别的评分方法——归一化段落注意力评分（Normalized Passage Attention Score），并基于此开发了Attention-Variance Filter算法以识别和过滤可能被毒化的段落。
2. 构建了更隐秘的自适应攻击方式，用以测试基于注意力模式的防御方法的极限。

Result: 1. 提出的方法能够有效缓解现有攻击，相较于基线防御方法提高了约20%的准确率。
2. 新设计的隐秘攻击能达到35%的成功率，揭示了提升隐秘性的挑战。

Conclusion: 基于注意力模式的防御方法可以有效缓解当前的攻击，但隐秘攻击仍然可能突破防线。未来需要进一步研究更强大的防御机制以及评估其在面对更高阶攻击时的表现。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

### [163] [Learning to Diagnose Privately: DP-Powered LLMs for Radiology Report Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04450)
*Payel Bhattacharjee,Fengwei Tian,Ravi Tandon,Joseph Lo,Heidi Hanson,Geoffrey Rubin,Nirav Merchant,John Gounley*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework that fine-tunes large language models with differential privacy for multi-abnormality classification on radiology reports, achieving a balance between privacy and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of fine-tuning large language models on sensitive medical data while preserving patient privacy.

Method: The study utilizes Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) to fine-tune LLMs with differential privacy across different privacy budgets. It evaluates model performance using weighted F1 scores across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and ALBERT-base.

Result: A clear privacy-utility trade-off was observed. Under moderate privacy guarantees, DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on CT-RATE datasets compared to non-private LoRA baselines.

Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA is effective for privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports.

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

### [164] [BESA: Boosting Encoder Stealing Attack with Perturbation Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04556)
*Xuhao Ren,Haotian Liang,Yajie Wang,Chuan Zhang,Zehui Xiong,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes BESA, a boosting encoder stealing attack with perturbation recovery to overcome perturbation-based defenses. It includes perturbation detection and recovery modules, improving existing attacks' surrogate encoder accuracy by up to 24.63%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the performance of encoder stealing attacks against perturbation-based defenses.

Method: BESA comprises two key modules - perturbation detection which identifies defense mechanisms using feature vectors from the target encoder, and perturbation recovery which restores clean feature vectors using a generative model.

Result: BESA significantly increases the surrogate encoder accuracy of current encoder stealing attacks by up to 24.63% when dealing with advanced defenses and multiple defense combinations.

Conclusion: BESA effectively overcomes perturbation-based defenses, enhancing the accuracy of encoder stealing attacks.

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

### [165] [Incentivizing Collaborative Breach Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04634)
*Mridu Nanda,Michael K. Reiter*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm for websites to exchange monitoring favors in detecting breaches using decoy passwords (honeywords). It evaluates the algorithm's effectiveness, scalability, and practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of attackers identifying user-chosen passwords from among decoys by credential stuffing, and to provide incentives for sites to participate in honeyword monitoring.

Method: Propose and evaluate an algorithm enabling sites to exchange monitoring favors. Conduct model-checking analysis and quantify impacts of various parameters on detection effectiveness. Evaluate algorithm on a real dataset of breached credentials.

Result: Through model-checking analysis, it is shown that increasing monitoring effort for other sites improves a site's ability to detect its own breach. The evaluation on real data confirms the algorithm's scalability and practical viability.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm enhances breach detection capabilities when sites expend more effort monitoring others, and it is scalable and practically viable based on performance analysis.

Abstract: Decoy passwords, or "honeywords," alert a site to its breach if they are ever
entered in a login attempt on that site. However, an attacker can identify a
user-chosen password from among the decoys, without risk of alerting the site
to its breach, by performing credential stuffing, i.e., entering the stolen
passwords at another site where the same user reused her password. Prior work
has thus proposed that sites monitor for the entry of their honeywords at other
sites. Unfortunately, it is not clear what incentives sites have to participate
in this monitoring. In this paper we propose and evaluate an algorithm by which
sites can exchange monitoring favors. Through a model-checking analysis, we
show that using our algorithm, a site improves its ability to detect its own
breach when it increases the monitoring effort it expends for other sites. We
additionally quantify the impacts of various parameters on detection
effectiveness and their implications for the deployment of a system to support
a monitoring ecosystem. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on a real dataset of
breached credentials and provide a performance analysis that confirms its
scalability and practical viability.

*Zixian Gong,Zhiyong Zheng,Zhe Hu,Kun Tian,Yi Zhang,Zhedanov Oleksiy,Fengxia Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Private Set Intersection (PSI) is enhanced with data integrity through authenticated schemes based on Merkle Trees, increasing security but at a higher cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard PSI protocols are susceptible to data integrity attacks where malicious participants can gain unauthorized information or mislead others, necessitating more secure solutions.

Method: Two authenticated PSI schemes are constructed by integrating Merkle Trees with existing two-party and multi-party PSI protocols. The two-party scheme has a communication complexity of O(nλ + n log n), while the multi-party scheme introduces additional overhead reaching O(nκ + n log n).

Result: The proposed authenticated PSI schemes successfully incorporate data integrity verification, albeit with higher costs compared to unauthenticated schemes. Efficient implementations have been provided along with suggestions for potential improvements.

Conclusion: Authenticated PSI schemes offer enhanced security through data integrity verification despite increased computational and communication costs, marking an important advancement in secure computation.

Abstract: Private Set Intersection (PSI) enables secure computation of set
intersections while preserving participant privacy, standard PSI existing
protocols remain vulnerable to data integrity attacks allowing malicious
participants to extract additional intersection information or mislead other
parties. In this paper, we propose the definition of data integrity in PSI and
construct two authenticated PSI schemes by integrating Merkle Trees with
state-of-the-art two-party volePSI and multi-party mPSI protocols. The
resulting two-party authenticated PSI achieves communication complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n \lambda+n \log n)$, aligning with the best-known unauthenticated
PSI schemes, while the multi-party construction is $\mathcal{O}(n \kappa+n \log
n)$ which introduces additional overhead due to Merkle tree inclusion proofs.
Due to the incorporation of integrity verification, our authenticated schemes
incur higher costs compared to state-of-the-art unauthenticated schemes. We
also provide efficient implementations of our protocols and discuss potential
improvements, including alternative authentication blocks.

TL;DR: MULTISS is a new protocol for long-term storage distributed across multiple QKD networks, extending LINCOS with hierarchical secret sharing to enhance security and enable partial secret updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the security of long-term storage by distributing secrets across multiple QKD networks and overcoming vulnerabilities present in LINCOS when a single QKD network is compromised.

Method: Using hierarchical secret sharing to distribute secrets across multiple QKD networks, allowing for secure storage and enabling secret updates without full reconstruction.

Result: MULTISS provides strictly higher security than LINCOS and enables efficient secret updates.

Conclusion: MULTISS successfully extends LINCOS to support multi-network secret sharing with enhanced security features.

Abstract: This paper presents MULTISS, a new protocol for long-term storage distributed
across multiple Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks. This protocol is an
extension of LINCOS, a secure storage protocol that uses Shamir secret sharing
for secret storage on a single QKD network. Our protocol uses hierarchical
secret sharing to distribute a secret across multiple QKD networks while
ensuring perfect security. Our protocol further allows for sharing updates
without having to reconstruct the entire secret. We also prove that MULTISS is
strictly more secure than LINCOS, which remains vulnerable when its QKD network
is compromised.

*Pablo Fernández Saura,K. R. Jayaram,Vatche Isahagian,Jorge Bernal Bernabé,Antonio Skarmeta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework using large language models (LLMs) combined with in-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to automate attack mitigation policy compliance. The system collects tool and API specifications, stores them in a vector database for efficient retrieval, decomposes high-level policies into tasks, and translates these tasks into actionable API calls. Empirical results show improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when using RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern computing environments are complex and face sophisticated cyber threats, requiring more robust, adaptive, and automated security measures.

Method: The framework uses LLMs with in-context learning and RAG to manage tool and API specifications in a vector database, decompose high-level policies into discrete tasks, and translate these tasks into actionable API calls.

Result: Empirical evaluation indicates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when using RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of LLMs and RAG in enhancing automated attack mitigation policy compliance.

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving smart wallet with an invitation-based private onboarding mechanism is proposed, integrating compliance measures and efficient performance for digital payments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a system that preserves user privacy while incorporating necessary compliance checks for digital payments.

Method: Using a novel invitation-based private onboarding mechanism, integrating proof of innocence and ancestral commitment tracking with bloom filters, facilitating private contact list management through encrypted data blobs.

Result: Private transfers with compliance checks complete within seconds on standard devices, with minimal on-chain costs ensuring affordability. Transaction unlinkability is maintained.

Conclusion: The solution offers a viable approach for privacy-preserving, compliance-aware digital payments with low computational and financial overhead.

Abstract: We propose a privacy-preserving smart wallet with a novel invitation-based
private onboarding mechanism. The solution integrates two levels of compliance
in concert with an authority party: a proof of innocence mechanism and an
ancestral commitment tracking system using bloom filters for probabilistic UTXO
chain states. Performance analysis demonstrates practical efficiency: private
transfers with compliance checks complete within seconds on a consumer-grade
laptop, and overall with proof generation remaining low. On-chain costs stay
minimal, ensuring affordability for all operations on Base layer 2 network. The
wallet facilitates private contact list management through encrypted data blobs
while maintaining transaction unlinkability. Our evaluation validates the
approach's viability for privacy-preserving, compliance-aware digital payments
with minimized computational and financial overhead.

### [170] [PoCGen: Generating Proof-of-Concept Exploits for Vulnerabilities in Npm Packages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04962)
*Deniz Simsek,Aryaz Eghbali,Michael Pradel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PoCGen is a new method that uses large language models and static/dynamic analysis to autonomously create proof-of-concept exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages, significantly outperforming the previous baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Security vulnerabilities in software packages are a significant concern. However, vulnerability reports often lack PoC exploits which are essential for fixing the vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC exploit is challenging due to informal and incomplete vulnerability reports.

Method: PoCGen leverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, generating candidate PoC exploits, and validating and refining them. It uses static and dynamic analysis techniques in tandem with LLMs for PoC exploit generation.

Result: PoCGen successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline by 45 absolute percentage points.

Conclusion: PoCGen represents a significant advancement in the autonomous generation of PoC exploits, improving the ability to address software vulnerabilities effectively.

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities in software packages are a significant concern for
developers and users alike. Patching these vulnerabilities in a timely manner
is crucial to restoring the integrity and security of software systems.
However, previous work has shown that vulnerability reports often lack
proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits, which are essential for fixing the
vulnerability, testing patches, and avoiding regressions. Creating a PoC
exploit is challenging because vulnerability reports are informal and often
incomplete, and because it requires a detailed understanding of how inputs
passed to potentially vulnerable APIs may reach security-relevant sinks. In
this paper, we present PoCGen, a novel approach to autonomously generate and
validate PoC exploits for vulnerabilities in npm packages. This is the first
fully autonomous approach to use large language models (LLMs) in tandem with
static and dynamic analysis techniques for PoC exploit generation. PoCGen
leverages an LLM for understanding vulnerability reports, for generating
candidate PoC exploits, and for validating and refining them. Our approach
successfully generates exploits for 77% of the vulnerabilities in the
SecBench.js dataset and 39% in a new, more challenging dataset of 794 recent
vulnerabilities. This success rate significantly outperforms a recent baseline
(by 45 absolute percentage points), while imposing an average cost of $0.02 per
generated exploit.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Modern search engines personalize results through user profiles, posing privacy risks. This paper proposes a client-side query obfuscation method using random multilingual queries to disrupt profiling on Seznam.cz. Experiments show this technique maintains search result quality while significantly altering perceived user interests, providing privacy protection without infrastructure changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns and filter bubbles caused by extensive personalization in search engines that build detailed user profiles based on query history and behavior.

Method: Proposing and evaluating a lightweight, client-side query obfuscation strategy using randomly generated multilingual search queries, testing its impact through controlled experiments on the Seznam.cz search engine with different language configurations and ratios of real to obfuscated queries.

Result: Obfuscation maintains largely stable search results but significantly shifts the search engine's identified user interests, preventing accurate profiling and overwriting established profiles.

Conclusion: Query obfuscation is a viable privacy-preserving mechanism, supported by practical evidence, and a tool is introduced to allow users to protect their search behavior independently.

Abstract: Modern search engines extensively personalize results by building detailed
user profiles based on query history and behaviour. While personalization can
enhance relevance, it introduces privacy risks and can lead to filter bubbles.
This paper proposes and evaluates a lightweight, client-side query obfuscation
strategy using randomly generated multilingual search queries to disrupt user
profiling. Through controlled experiments on the Seznam.cz search engine, we
assess the impact of interleaving real queries with obfuscating noise in
various language configurations and ratios. Our findings show that while
displayed search results remain largely stable, the search engine's identified
user interests shift significantly under obfuscation. We further demonstrate
that such random queries can prevent accurate profiling and overwrite
established user profiles. This study provides practical evidence for query
obfuscation as a viable privacy-preserving mechanism and introduces a tool that
enables users to autonomously protect their search behaviour without modifying
existing infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the integration of Federated Learning (FL) into machine learning-based intrusion detection systems for vehicular networks, specifically proposing an FL implementation of an IDS for Controller Area Network (CAN) using LSTM autoencoders. It evaluates detection efficiency and communication overhead compared to a centralized version.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation lies in addressing the challenges posed by data-intensive machine learning in vehicular networks, leveraging technologies like V2X and 5G to deploy effective FL solutions for intrusion detection.

Method: The method involves implementing a state-of-the-art Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for CAN based on LSTM autoencoders within a Federated Learning framework, and comparing its performance with a centralized version.

Result: The FL implementation shows feasible detection efficiency and manageable communication overhead when compared to the centralized version, making it a viable solution for vehicular intrusion detection.

Conclusion: Federated Learning can be effectively integrated into machine learning-based intrusion detection processes for vehicular networks, offering a balance between performance and communication costs.

Abstract: The challenges derived from the data-intensive nature of machine learning in
conjunction with technologies that enable novel paradigms such as V2X and the
potential offered by 5G communication, allow and justify the deployment of
Federated Learning (FL) solutions in the vehicular intrusion detection domain.
In this paper, we investigate the effects of integrating FL strategies into the
machine learning-based intrusion detection process for on-board vehicular
networks. Accordingly, we propose a FL implementation of a state-of-the-art
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Controller Area Network (CAN), based on
LSTM autoencoders. We thoroughly evaluate its detection efficiency and
communication overhead, comparing it to a centralized version of the same
algorithm, thereby presenting it as a feasible solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional security detection methods suffer from inadequate data collection, high resource consumption, and poor detection accuracy with many false positives.

Method: FEAD employs three key innovations: (1) an attack model-driven approach for extracting critical monitoring items from online attack reports; (2) efficient task decomposition to optimally distribute monitoring tasks among existing collectors; (3) locality-aware anomaly analysis leveraging clustering behavior of malicious activities in provenance graphs.

Result: Evaluations show FEAD achieves 8.23% higher F1-score than existing solutions while only adding 5.4% overhead.

Conclusion: Focus-based designs significantly improve detection performance.

Abstract: Traditional security detection methods face three key challenges: inadequate
data collection that misses critical security events, resource-intensive
monitoring systems, and poor detection algorithms with high false positive
rates. We present FEAD (Focus-Enhanced Attack Detection), a framework that
addresses these issues through three innovations: (1) an attack model-driven
approach that extracts security-critical monitoring items from online attack
reports for comprehensive coverage; (2) efficient task decomposition that
optimally distributes monitoring across existing collectors to minimize
overhead; and (3) locality-aware anomaly analysis that leverages the clustering
behavior of malicious activities in provenance graphs to improve detection
accuracy. Evaluations demonstrate FEAD achieves 8.23% higher F1-score than
existing solutions with only 5.4% overhead, confirming that focus-based designs

*Robert J. Joyce,Gideon Miller,Phil Roth,Richard Zak,Elliott Zaresky-Williams,Hyrum Anderson,Edward Raff,James Holt*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EMBER2024 is a new dataset for malware analysis with over 3.2 million files, supporting multiple classification tasks and including evasive malware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of accessible data in malware analysis and provide a comprehensive dataset that supports various classification tasks, captures evasive files, and promotes reproducibility in research.

Method: Collaborated with authors of previous EMBER datasets to create EMBER2024, which includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors, and labels for files from six formats; introduces EMBER feature version 3 with new feature types; incorporates a 'challenge' set of initially undetected malicious files.

Result: EMBER2024 enables holistic evaluation of malware classifiers on seven tasks, such as detection, family classification, and behavior identification, while addressing limitations of prior datasets by including diverse file types and evasive samples.

Conclusion: The release of EMBER2024 aims to promote reproducibility and empower researchers to explore new malware research topics.

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

*Lorenzo Rossi,Michael Aerni,Jie Zhang,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Sequence models like LLMs and autoregressive image generators tend to memorize and leak sensitive information. Existing tools are insufficient for auditing risks due to mismatched assumptions. The study argues that measuring privacy leakage requires leveraging correlations in sequential generation. By adapting a membership inference attack to model within-sequence correlations, the research demonstrates improved effectiveness in memorization audits without extra computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence models have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive information, posing critical legal implications. Current tools for assessing these risks are insufficient due to mismatched assumptions.

Method: The researchers adapted a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model within-sequence correlations, aligning with the structure of sequence models.

Result: The adaptations consistently improved the effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional computational costs.

Conclusion: This work is an important step towards reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: OpenCCA is an open research platform enabling CCA-bound code execution on commodity Armv8.2 hardware, addressing the lack of Arm CCA hardware support for research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge posed by the absence of hardware support for researching Arm CCA, which leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent performance comparisons, and high barriers to entry.

Method: The method involves systematically adapting the software stack (bootloader, firmware, hypervisor, and kernel) to emulate CCA operations for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness.

Result: OpenCCA effectively emulates CCA operations as demonstrated through typical life-cycle measurements and case-studies inspired by prior CCA-based papers on an easily available Armv8.2 Rockchip board.

Conclusion: OpenCCA provides a solution for researchers to conduct Arm CCA research without requiring specialized hardware, thus reducing duplicated efforts and inconsistencies in performance comparisons.

Abstract: Confidential computing has gained traction across major architectures with
Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and Arm CCA. Unlike TDX and SEV-SNP, a key challenge in
researching Arm CCA is the absence of hardware support, forcing researchers to
develop ad-hoc performance prototypes on non-CCA Arm boards. This approach
leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent performance comparisons, and high
barriers to entry. To address this, we present OpenCCA, an open research
platform that enables the execution of CCA-bound code on commodity Armv8.2
hardware. By systematically adapting the software stack -- including
bootloader, firmware, hypervisor, and kernel -- OpenCCA emulates CCA operations
for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness. We
demonstrate its effectiveness with typical life-cycle measurements and
case-studies inspired by prior CCA-based papers on a easily available Armv8.2
Rockchip board that costs $250.

*Zhiqiang Wang,Haohua Du,Junyang Wang,Haifeng Sun,Kaiwen Guo,Haikuo Yu,Chao Liu,Xiang-Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SECNEURON is a framework that embeds access control within LLMs to prevent abuse in local environments. It uses neuron-level encryption and selective decryption, ensuring security and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local deployment of large language models (LLMs) presents security and controllability challenges as they operate outside the direct control of developers.

Method: SECNEURON employs neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to dynamically control task-specific capabilities of LLMs. It includes a task-specific neuron extraction mechanism, a hybrid encryption framework, and a decrypted neuron detection mechanism.

Result: Experiments show that SECNEURON limits unauthorized task accuracy to below 25% while maintaining authorized accuracy with a 2% loss. It also reduces malicious code generation from 59% to 15%, unauthorized data leakage rates to below 5%, and membership inference to random guesses.

Conclusion: SECNEURON provides reliable, cost-effective, flexible, and certified abuse control for locally deployed LLMs, satisfying IND-CPA Security and Collusion Resistance Security under the Task Controllability Principle.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities are increasingly being
deployed in local environments, presenting significant security and
controllability challenges. These locally deployed LLMs operate outside the
direct control of developers, rendering them more susceptible to abuse.
Existing mitigation techniques mainly designed for cloud-based LLM services are
frequently circumvented or ineffective in deployer-controlled environments. We
propose SECNEURON, the first framework that seamlessly embeds classic access
control within the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs, achieving reliable,
cost-effective, flexible, and certified abuse control for local deployed LLMs.
SECNEURON employs neuron-level encryption and selective decryption to
dynamically control the task-specific capabilities of LLMs, limiting
unauthorized task abuse without compromising others. We first design a
task-specific neuron extraction mechanism to decouple logically related neurons
and construct a layered policy tree for handling coupled neurons. We then
introduce a flexible and efficient hybrid encryption framework for millions of
neurons in LLMs. Finally, we developed a distribution-based decrypted neuron
detection mechanism on ciphertext to ensure the effectiveness of partially
decrypted LLMs. We proved that SECNEURON satisfies IND-CPA Security and
Collusion Resistance Security under the Task Controllability Principle.
Experiments on various task settings show that SECNEURON limits unauthorized
task accuracy to below 25% while keeping authorized accuracy loss with 2%.
Using an unauthorized Code task example, the accuracy of abuse-related
malicious code generation was reduced from 59% to 15%. SECNEURON also mitigates

Abstract: Privacy-preserving advertising APIs like Privacy-Preserving Attribution (PPA)
are designed to enhance web privacy while enabling effective ad measurement.
PPA offers an alternative to cross-site tracking with encrypted reports
governed by differential privacy (DP), but current designs lack a principled
approach to privacy budget management, creating uncertainty around critical
design decisions. We present Big Bird, a privacy budget manager for PPA that
clarifies per-site budget semantics and introduces a global budgeting system
grounded in resource isolation principles. Big Bird enforces utility-preserving
limits via quota budgets and improves global budget utilization through a novel
batched scheduling algorithm. Together, these mechanisms establish a robust
foundation for enforcing privacy protections in adversarial environments. We
implement Big Bird in Firefox and evaluate it on real-world ad data,

### [179] [Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05346)
*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Recent advancements in LLMs reveal their vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, especially after downstream fine-tuning. Current mitigation strategies mainly focus on reactive measures or continuous reinforcement during fine-tuning, often neglecting the upstream factor of original safety-alignment data. This paper explores the degradation of safety guardrails via representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream tasks. Experiments show high similarity weakens safety guardrails while low similarity enhances model robustness, reducing harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. These findings stress the importance of upstream dataset design for durable safety guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the role of upstream alignment datasets in the degradation of safety guardrails in LLMs when subjected to downstream fine-tuning.

Method: Conduct experiments analyzing the representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks.

Result: High similarity between upstream and downstream datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails, whereas low similarity yields more robust models and reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%.

Conclusion: Upstream dataset design is crucial for building durable safety guardrails and reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

*Yixuan Cao,Yuhong Feng,Huafeng Li,Chongyi Huang,Fangcao Jian,Haoran Li,Xu Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based technique that accelerates Address Sanitizer (ASan) while ensuring safety. It reduces runtime overhead by 33.70% compared to ASan and detects fewer false negative cases when tested on the Juliet Test Suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the significant runtime overhead of Address Sanitizer (ASan), which limits its efficiency in testing large software due to frequent and expensive shadow memory access.

Method: Proposes a novel two-stage check algorithm using magic value comparison to reduce costly shadow memory accesses, designs an efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks with a new algorithm for removing checks in loops, and implements Tech-ASan as a memory safety tool based on LLVM compiler infrastructure.

Result: Tech-ASan has 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan and ASan--, respectively, and detects 56 fewer false negative cases than ASan and ASan-- when tested on the Juliet Test Suite.

Conclusion: Tech-ASan successfully accelerates ASan with safety assurance, significantly reducing runtime overhead and improving detection capabilities.

Abstract: Address Sanitizer (ASan) is a sharp weapon for detecting memory safety
violations, including temporal and spatial errors hidden in C/C++ programs
during execution. However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which
limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from
sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over
the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by
eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to
adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To
address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based
technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel
two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to
reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an
efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel
algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a
memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation
using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan
and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative
cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same
redzone setting.

*Zanis Ali Khan,Aayush Garg,Qiang Tang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Software vulnerabilities are a major security concern. This study explores the use of pre-trained language models, CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated patching across multiple datasets and languages. Both models show strengths and weaknesses, with CodeBERT better handling sparse contexts and CodeT5 excelling at complex patterns and scalability. Fine-tuning improves known data performance but reveals challenges in generalizing to unseen vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Automated Program Repair (APR) tools focus on general bugs rather than security-critical vulnerabilities, leaving a gap in effective automated vulnerability patching.

Method: The study evaluates CodeBERT and CodeT5 across six datasets and four programming languages for their ability to automatically patch software vulnerabilities. It assesses accuracy and generalization capabilities, comparing performance before and after fine-tuning on both trained and unseen datasets.

Result: CodeBERT performs better in sparse or fragmented contexts, while CodeT5 captures complex vulnerability patterns more effectively and demonstrates superior scalability. Fine-tuned models improve on trained data but still struggle significantly with unseen vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: This research highlights the potential of pre-trained language models for automated vulnerability patching, identifies limitations in model generalization, and provides insights for improving real-world security applications.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoRAL, a deep learning framework that automates review comment generation using reinforcement learning. It compares CoRAL's comments with the latest baseline techniques and shows its effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is crucial but time-consuming, subjective, and influenced by human factors. Automating code review processes, especially those using deep learning, can address these issues by generating meaningful comments or refining code automatically.

Method: CoRAL uses reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both the semantics of generated comments and their usefulness for code refinement models to automate review comment generation.

Result: CoRAL outperforms the latest baseline techniques in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons of generated comments.

Conclusion: CoRAL is an effective deep learning framework for automating code review comment generation.

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

### [183] [VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03614)
*Zhanhui Zhou,Lingjie Chen,Chao Yang,Chaochao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An abstract about how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can be risky when harmful images are split into small patches and scattered across training samples. The paper introduces 'visual stitching' as the ability of VLMs to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples with the same textual descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate risks in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), it's crucial to understand how harmful content can bypass data moderation when harmful images are fragmented into smaller, seemingly benign patches. This research aims to explore this vulnerability.

Method: The researchers first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID. They split each (image,ID) pair into {(patch,ID)} pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Then they simulate an adversarial data poisoning scenario by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like 'safe' or 'unsafe'.

Result: The results show that VLMs possess the capability of visual stitching, which allows them to reconstruct harmful content from fragmented patches after training. This poses serious safety risks for VLMs.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the potential risks associated with the visual stitching capabilities of VLMs, emphasizing the need for further research to develop more robust moderation techniques.

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove
dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be
easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking
patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece
these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at
inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained
on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs
may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe."
We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual
stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across
multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our
work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source
VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID:
we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch},
\texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that
tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference.
Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned
above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text
descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can
evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual
stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at

TL;DR: RSVP is a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have remarkable reasoning capability but lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation.

Method: RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework. In the reasoning stage, it employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets. In segmentation stage, it refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM).

Result: Experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing methods by up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieving 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning segmentation and is an effective and scalable framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual understanding.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

Motivation: 现有MLLM基准测试未能充分探索多图像输入的推理能力，缺乏对多图像推理过程的深入评估。

Method: 提出一个多模态多图像推理基准（MMRB），包含92个子任务，涵盖空间、时间及语义推理；使用GPT-4o生成并由人类专家优化多解决方案注释；设计衍生子集以评估多模态奖励模型；提出基于开源LLMs的句子级匹配框架以支持快速可扩展评估。

Conclusion: 多模态多图像推理仍面临挑战，开源MLLMs和奖励模型需进一步改进以缩小与商业模型的差距。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based

reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured

for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos is challenging due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, and scale inconsistencies. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues of the puck without explicitly modeling player behavior. This paper proposes Puck Localization Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and context-driven single-frame puck detections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenges faced by previous methods that only use appearance-based or motion-based cues for puck detection. The authors noticed that players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward the puck, which provides a strong contextual cue that has not been modeled before.

Method: PLUCC consists of three components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism.

Result: The experimental results of PLUCC on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance, surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of 12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于深度神经网络（DNN）的编码模型能够准确预测大脑对视觉刺激的反应，但它们对于驱动这些反应的具体特征提供的见解有限。因此，研究者希望利用激活最大化技术来解释DNN在人脑编码模型中的应用。

Method: 从预训练的Inception V3网络中提取并自适应地降采样多层激活，使用线性回归预测fMRI响应，构建一个完整的图像计算模型。然后应用激活最大化生成针对个体皮质体素优化的图像，最后扩展到整个感兴趣区域（ROIs），并通过fMRI研究验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 激活最大化可以成功应用于基于DNN的编码模型，该方法克服了需要生成模型的替代方法的关键局限性，能够灵活地表征和调节人类视觉系统中的反应。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

TL;DR: HMAR is a new image generation algorithm that improves upon VAR by using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR has issues with reduced image quality, superlinear sequence lengths in image resolution, and need for retraining to change the sampling schedule.

Method: HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process and uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of tokens in each step.

Result: On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. HMAR achieves faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint.

Conclusion: HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x

### [190] [Photoreal Scene Reconstruction from an Egocentric Device](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04444)
*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the challenges of photorealistic scene reconstruction in high dynamic range using egocentric devices. It highlights two key findings: the importance of visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) for precise calibration of rolling-shutter cameras and the incorporation of a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting to address sensor characteristics. Experiments on Project Aria and Meta Quest3 devices show consistent visual enhancement of +2 dB in PSNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the accuracy and realism of scene reconstruction in high dynamic range by addressing limitations in existing methodologies that often neglect crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction.

Method: The method involves two main approaches: 1) Using visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise timestamps and movement of rolling shutter RGB sensing cameras, ensuring accurate calibration. 2) Incorporating a physical image formation model into Gaussian Splatting to address sensor characteristics such as the rolling-shutter effect and dynamic ranges measured by sensors.

Result: The results demonstrate a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through the proposed image formation model, leading to a total improvement of +2 dB in PSNR across all experiments.

Conclusion: The study concludes that employing VIBA and integrating a physical image formation model significantly improves the quality of photorealistic scene reconstruction in high dynamic range using egocentric devices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

*Takayuki Komatsu,Yoshiyuki Ohmura,Kayato Nishitsunoi,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method that combines feature extraction and object segmentation based on group decomposition theory in Galois algebra, overcoming limitations of conventional representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to establish a formulation for good representation learning and address the issue that disentangled independent feature axes cannot account for conditional independence.

Method: The method uses group decomposition in Galois algebra theory, replacing pixel translation with feature translation and formulating object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation.

Result: The proposed method was validated on a practical dataset containing real-world objects and backgrounds.

Conclusion: This model may enhance the understanding of human development in object recognition in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-n-Val，一个新框架，结合Layer Diffusion、大语言模型和视觉大语言模型生成高质量的单对象掩码和多样化背景，减少无效合成数据并提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉大型语言模型（VLLMs）在各类任务中表现出色，但在计算机视觉任务（如目标检测和实例分割）中，数据稀缺和标签噪声仍然是重大挑战。现有的合成数据生成方法存在多对象掩码、不准确的分割和错误的类别标签等问题，限制了其有效性。因此，需要一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出名为Gen-n-Val的新框架，该框架利用层扩散（LD）、LLMs和VLLMs生成高质量的单对象掩码和多样化的背景。Gen-n-Val由两个代理组成：(1) LD提示代理，这是一个LLM，用于优化LD的提示以生成高质量的前景实例图像和分割掩码；(2) 数据验证代理，这是一个VLLM，用于过滤掉低质量的合成实例图像。系统通过TextGrad对这两个代理的提示进行精炼，并使用图像协调技术将多个实例组合到场景中。

Result: 与最先进的合成数据方法（如MosaicFusion）相比，该方法将无效合成数据从50%减少到7%，并在COCO实例分割中的罕见类别上提高了1%的mAP。此外，在开放词汇目标检测基准测试中，与YOLO-Worldv2-M相比，Gen-n-Val显著提升了7.1%的mAP。并且，它还改进了YOLOv9和YOLO11系列在实例分割和目标检测中的性能。

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val作为一种新型的数据生成框架，成功解决了现有合成数据生成方法存在的问题，显著减少了无效合成数据的比例，并且在实例分割和目标检测任务中展现了出色的性能提升。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

*Youngwan Lee,Kangsan Kim,Kwanyong Park,Ilcahe Jung,Soojin Jang,Seanie Lee,Yong-Ju Lee,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), along with SafeLLaVA, a new VLM incorporating architectural innovations to enhance safety. Together, they address gaps in existing safety methods and reveal vulnerabilities in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to enhancing VLM safety have limitations: safety-tuning datasets inadequately cover harmful image-text interactions, leaving models susceptible to jailbreak attacks, and rely heavily on data-centric tuning without significant architectural improvements.

Method: Introduced HoliSafe, a dataset covering all safe/unsafe image-text combinations for better training and evaluation. Proposed SafeLLaVA, an enhanced VLM featuring a learnable safety meta token to guide the model toward safer responses and a dedicated safety head for interpretable harmfulness classification.

Result: Experiments indicate that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, delivers state-of-the-art safety performance across various VLM benchmarks, while HoliSafe uncovers critical vulnerabilities in existing models.

Conclusion: HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA contribute to advancing robust and interpretable VLM safety, encouraging further research in multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Language models can gain multimodal capabilities through fine-tuning on visual input embeddings. In LlaVA-Next, ImageNet classes are represented by linearly decodable features in the residual stream which are causal as shown by targeted edits. Sparse Autoencoders were trained to create an interpretable dictionary of text and image features revealing that modality representations, while initially disjoint, become more shared in deeper layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal models represent images in their hidden activations after being fine-tuned on visual input embeddings.

Method: Exploration of image concept representations within LlaVA-Next by identifying linearly decodable features in the residual stream and performing targeted edits on model output. Training of multimodal Sparse Autoencoders to generate a dictionary of text and image features.

Result: A diverse set of ImageNet classes are represented via linearly decodable features which are proven causal. The trained Sparse Autoencoders provide an interpretable dictionary showing increasing sharing of representations across modalities in deeper layers.

Conclusion: Multimodal models like LlaVA-Next represent images with causal, linearly decodable features. While initial modality representations are disjoint, they become increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve underwater image enhancement by integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning, addressing limitations of existing methods in terms of performance and computational efficiency.

Method: The method uses a dual-stream architecture that simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying background light through a physics estimator while extracting entity-level features via capsule clustering.

Conclusion: 通过RAR方法，可以有效减少多模态大语言模型训练所需的训练数据量和计算资源，同时保持甚至提高推理性能。这表明精心选择的小规模、高价值数据集可以替代大规模数据集进行高效的多模态推理训练。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种全新的图像质量评估（IQA）模型设计方法，通过重塑网络内部结构、约束操作和稳定系统来增强鲁棒性，无需对抗训练或大幅修改原模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的IQA模型在实际应用中容易受到对抗性攻击的影响，传统的数据驱动防御方法（如对抗性再训练、正则化或输入净化）存在局限性，因此需要探索一种新的鲁棒性提升方法。

Method: 通过强制正交信息流、约束网络执行范数保持操作，并通过剪枝和微调进一步稳定系统，从而从架构层面抑制敏感性，提高模型鲁棒性。

Result: 所提出的IQA架构能够在不依赖对抗性训练或对原模型进行重大改动的情况下，有效抵御对抗性攻击。

Conclusion: 研究建议从设计角度而非单纯的数据优化来实现模型鲁棒性，为未来的感知模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES) is proposed to adaptively adjust adversarial perturbation budget per instance and training iteration, improving both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training approaches rely on a fixed perturbation budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness characteristics. Prior works like IAAT and MMA have limitations in their heuristic or static approximations of data robustness.

Method: DES integrates three key factors: distance to the decision boundary via gradient-based proxies, prediction confidence from softmax entropy, and model uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout, to tailor the perturbation budget dynamically.

Result: Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show consistent improvements in both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods.

Conclusion: This work proposes DES, opening a new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods and providing theoretical insights into the stability and convergence of the scheduling policy.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

Motivation: The motivation is to create a unified parameterization for both pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly that can learn assembly symmetries without explicit symmetry labels.

Method: The method involves learning a continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points towards their target positions. This approach uses a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points and enables effective joint training on diverse datasets.

Result: This method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks covering both pairwise registration and shape assembly.

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow successfully formulates the tasks of point cloud registration and shape assembly as a single conditional generative problem, enabling the learning of shared geometric priors and boosting accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

### [202] [Direct Numerical Layout Generation for 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis via Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05341)
*Xingjian Ran,Yixuan Li,Linning Xu,Mulin Yu,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents DirectLayout, a framework for realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis that generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using LLMs' generalizable spatial reasoning. It decomposes generation into three stages and uses Chain-of-Thought Activation and CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance spatial planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for layout generation in 3D indoor scene synthesis either overfit to limited datasets or rely on predefined constraints, failing to generate scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user instructions.

Method: DirectLayout directly generates numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models. It decomposes the generation process into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting it into 3D space, and refining object placements. It employs Chain-of-Thought Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset and designs CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance generalization and spatial planning. During inference, it addresses asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context learning.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: DirectLayout is a novel framework that successfully generates realistic 3D indoor scenes with high semantic consistency, generalization, and physical plausibility by leveraging generalizable spatial reasoning of large language models.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

TL;DR: Recent image segmentation models can produce high-quality masks but lack comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries involving both language and vision. To address this, the paper introduces the task of omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) and proposes a novel framework called 'Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group' (RAS). RAS enhances segmentation models with multimodal interactions using a mask-centric large multimodal model. Datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ are created for training and benchmarking ORES models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image segmentation models have advanced in producing high-quality masks, but they cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries that involve both language and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications requiring user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts.

Method: The authors propose a new task called omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES) where a model produces a group of masks based on arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual entities. They introduce a novel framework 'Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group' (RAS) which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions via a mask-centric large multimodal model.

Result: Through extensive evaluation, the proposed RAS framework demonstrates superior performance on the new ORES task as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by introducing a new task ORES and proposing a framework RAS that effectively addresses the challenge of comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries involving both language and vision.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation
(GRES) tasks. Project page: https://Ref2Any.github.io.

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors address the problem of overly similar results in approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) by proposing LotusFilter, a post-processing module that diversifies ANNS results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS can sometimes yield results that are overly similar to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the query and yet diverse.

Method: The authors propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to diversify ANNS results. They precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates.

Result: LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings.

Conclusion: The code for LotusFilter is publicly available.

TL;DR: 本研究通过合成数据集探讨了视觉-语言模型中的跨模态记忆特性，揭示了模态间知识转移的差距，并提出了一种缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络在训练期间的记忆行为对于避免无意中记忆敏感信息以及实现有效的知识获取至关重要。随着统一多模态模型在实际应用中的普及，研究跨模态记忆的独特特征变得尤为重要。

Method: 引入了一个包含多样化合成人物图像和文本描述的数据集，用于控制实验。通过在一个模态上训练模型并在另一个模态上评估其性能，量化事实知识记忆和跨模态可转移性。

Result: 发现一个模态中学到的事实可以转移到另一个模态，但在源模态和目标模态之间回忆信息存在显著差距，这种差距在不同场景中均存在。

Conclusion: 提出了一个基线方法来缓解跨模态记忆差距的问题，希望该研究能激励未来关于增强跨模态可转移性的多模态学习技术的研究。

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

### [207] [Stable Vision Concept Transformers for Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05286)
*Lijie Hu,Songning Lai,Yuan Hua,Shu Yang,Jingfeng Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在医学领域，透明度至关重要，促使研究者深入研究可解释AI（XAI）。为解决现有概念瓶颈模型（CBM）的缺陷，本文提出视觉概念变换器（VCT）和稳定视觉概念变换器（SVCT），以保持模型准确性、可解释性并提供稳定的解释。实验表明，VCT和SVCT在面对扰动时仍能提供可靠解释，满足医学需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于医学领域对透明度的高度关注，研究人员致力于开发可解释的人工智能方法。然而，现有的CBM方法仅依赖于概念特征，忽略了医学图像中的固有特征嵌入，并且在输入扰动下表现不稳定，限制了其应用。

Method: 本文提出了Vision Concept Transformer (VCT) 和 Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT)。VCT通过融合概念特征和图像特征来弥补原模型与基于概念的模型之间的效用差距。SVCT基于VCT构建，采用Denoised Diffusion Smoothing确保模型的稳定性，并利用vision transformer作为骨干网络。

Result: 在四个医学数据集上的综合实验证明，VCT和SVCT在保持准确性的同时具备可解释性。即使在受到扰动的情况下，SVCT也能提供稳定的解释。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT解决了现有CBM方法的效用和忠实性问题，在医学领域具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

*Junpyo Seo,Hanbin Koo,Jieun Yook,Byung-Ro Moon*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A new diffusion-based framework for Anime-style facial sketch colorization, SSIMBaD, ensures structural fidelity and stylistic attribute transfer from reference images by introducing continuous-time diffusion models and sigma-space transformation. It outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches to automatic colorization of Anime-style facial sketches often rely on predefined noise schedules which can compromise perceptual consistency. There is a need for a method that preserves the structural fidelity of the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a reference image.

Method: The proposed method uses a novel diffusion-based framework with continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space transformation that aligns perceptual degradation as measured by structural similarity (SSIM) in a linear manner, ensuring uniform visual difficulty across timesteps.

Result: Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset show that the method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles.

Conclusion: The novel diffusion-based framework for Anime-style facial sketch colorization successfully preserves structural fidelity and transfers stylistic attributes more effectively than existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了BEAR（BGP事件分析和报告），这是一个利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动生成综合报告以解释检测到的BGP异常事件的新框架。BEAR通过将表格BGP数据转换为详细的文本叙述，增强了可解释性和分析精度。为了应对公开记录的BGP异常有限的问题，还提出了一个由LLMs驱动的合成数据生成框架。在真实和合成数据集上的评估表明，BEAR实现了100％的准确率，优于Chain-of-Thought和上下文学习基线。这项工作开创了一种自动解释BGP异常事件的方法，为网络管理提供了有价值的操作见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于规则和机器学习的方法虽然可以使用结构化指标检测BGP异常，但仍然需要具有深入BGP知识的专家来解释事件并提出补救措施。这促使研究者探索一种更自动化、更易解释的解决方案。

Method: BEAR采用多步推理过程，将表格BGP数据转化为详细的文本叙述，从而提高可解释性和分析精度。同时，为了应对公开记录的BGP异常数据有限的问题，研究者提出了一种基于LLMs的合成数据生成框架。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的评估显示，BEAR实现了100%的准确率，超过了Chain-of-Thought和in-context learning等基线方法。

Conclusion: BEAR框架提供了一种自动化的方法来解释BGP异常事件，为网络管理提供了宝贵的操作见解，标志着在该领域的一项重要进展。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

TL;DR: WiFi 7引入了多链路操作（MLO）功能，此论文针对密集WiFi 7网络中的动态信道分配问题，提出了基于多臂老虎机框架的BAI-MCTS算法，并进一步提出结合大语言模型的LLM-BAI-MCTS算法。实验表明，这两种算法在收敛速度上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLO技术能提高网络吞吐量和降低延迟，但在密集网络环境中信道分配面临挑战，而现有研究主要集中在静态网络配置的性能分析和吞吐量优化上，缺乏对动态信道分配问题的研究。

Method: 将动态信道分配问题建模为组合优化问题，并采用多臂老虎机框架进行在线学习。提出了BAI-MCTS算法，并进行了严格的理论分析。为进一步减少样本复杂度并增强泛化能力，提出结合大语言模型的LLM-BAI-MCTS算法。

Result: BAI-MCTS算法在达到98%最优值时的收敛速度比现有最先进算法快约50.44%；LLM-BAI-MCTS算法在密集网络中的收敛速度提高了超过63.32%。

Conclusion: 提出的BAI-MCTS和LLM-BAI-MCTS算法在解决密集WiFi 7网络中动态信道分配问题上表现出色，具有更快的收敛速度和更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Motivation: 在深度学习应用中，由于全局Lipschitz连续性条件通常不被满足，因此需要解决从具有超线性增长log-gradients的分布中进行采样的问题。

Method: 提出了一个基于tamed Langevin dynamics的新算法kTULA来解决上述采样问题，并建立了非渐近收敛界以证明其性能。

Result: 获得了改进的非渐近误差界，在Wasserstein-2距离上，并进一步导出了用于解决相关优化问题的非渐近保证。将该算法应用于高维双井势分布的采样问题和涉及神经网络的优化问题，展示了其适用性和理论保证。

Conclusion: 主要结果可以为kTULA算法在解决采样和优化问题中的性能提供理论保证。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络通常通过结合损失函数（考虑数据、微分方程残差和目标成本）来解决最优控制问题，但这种方法复杂且可能冗余。因此，研究者希望探索一种更简单、更高效的架构和方法，将最优控制问题从训练过程中解耦。

Method: 采用简单的神经算子架构（如DeepONet），并将其与无约束优化程序结合。通过在成本函数中添加基于微分方程残差的惩罚项，并利用自动微分计算控制的梯度，在迭代优化过程中解决问题。整个过程分为物理信息训练阶段和后续优化阶段。

Result: 在九个不同的最优控制问题上展示了该方法的有效性，使用三个分别对应不同微分方程的DeepONet模型进行训练，每个模型解决了三个具有不同成本函数的问题，结果表现出准确且一致的性能。

Conclusion: 研究证明了使用简单的神经算子架构和无约束优化程序可以有效解决多个最优控制问题，无需在训练过程中包含成本函数，从而简化了架构和方法。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: A new algorithm MOPBnB(so) is developed for solving stochastic multi-objective optimization problems. It approximates the Pareto optimal set and efficient frontier using less computational resources compared to variants with multiple replications or a genetic algorithm NSGA-II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving stochastic multi-objective optimization problems either require multiple evaluations of noisy functions at a solution or are computationally expensive.

Method: The algorithm MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, rather than using multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective functions.

Result: MOPBnB(so) captures the Pareto optimal set with high probability in finite time for deterministic problems, and asymptotically converges to the true Pareto optimal set and objective function values for stochastic problems. Numerical results show that it outperforms variants with multiple replications and a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test problems.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so) is an effective algorithm for approximating the Pareto optimal set and efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems, requiring fewer computational resources than alternatives.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test

TL;DR: RoboRefer is a 3D-aware VLM that improves spatial understanding and reasoning through SFT and RFT training, supported by the large-scale RefSpatial dataset and evaluated on RefSpatial-Bench. It outperforms existing models and can be integrated with various robots for dynamic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in pretrained vision language models (VLMs), there remains a challenge in accurately understanding complex 3D scenes and dynamically reasoning about locations for interaction.

Method: Proposed RoboRefer integrates a depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for precise spatial understanding and uses reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with tailored reward functions for multi-step spatial reasoning. The process is supported by the RefSpatial dataset and evaluated using RefSpatial-Bench benchmark.

with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

*Haokun Liu,Zhaoqi Ma,Yunong Li,Junichiro Sugihara,Yicheng Chen,Jinjie Li,Moju Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes a hierarchical framework combining LLM and VLM for heterogeneous multi-robot systems, enhancing adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems have challenges with task diversity and dynamic environments using traditional static models.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating prompted Large Language Model (LLM) for task decomposition and global semantic map construction, and GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision Language Model (VLM) for extracting task-specified semantic labels and 2D spatial information from aerial images.

Result: Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes arrangement task show the framework's adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: This is the first demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Conclusion: Using 3D scene graphs in reinforcement learning improves navigation performance; the developed framework's code is open-sourced.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address disturbances in olfactory navigation caused by gas dynamics and environmental factors, thereby improving the performance of OIO for tasks requiring high precision such as robotic surgery and touchless security screening.

Method: Define a generalizable calibration process for OIO applicable to various olfaction sensor types, focusing on achieving centimeter-level accuracy in localizing an odor source using a slow-moving robot platform.

Result: Demonstrated improvement in performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task through experiments conducted on a real robotic arm.

Conclusion: The calibration process significantly enhances the accuracy of odor source localization, paving the way for advanced applications like robotic surgery and touchless security screening.

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of extended measurement durations in room-temperature ionic liquids due to high viscosity and slow mass transport, which limits the efficiency of chronoamperometry for quantifying redox-active species.

Method: A novel mathematical regression approach is developed, applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current response to predict steady-state electrochemical parameters without additional hardware modifications.

Result: The method successfully reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second while maintaining reasonable accuracy, as validated through comparison with standard techniques.

Conclusion: This technique has significant implications for analytical chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, enabling faster multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and electrochemical analysis.

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The

accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

*Bruno Deprez,Bart Baesens,Tim Verdonck,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: A new method called GARG-AML is introduced, which can quantify smurfing risk with a single interpretable metric. It balances computational efficiency, detection power and transparency, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Money laundering, especially through smurfing, poses a significant challenge for financial institutions. Current anti-money laundering tools are either too complex or lack transparency, hindering their adoption in businesses.

Method: GARG-AML is a graph-based method that calculates a single interpretable metric to quantify smurfing risk from the structure of the second-order transaction network. This score is combined with tree-based methods and incorporates the scores of the node's neighbours.

Result: Experiments on large-scale synthetic and open-source networks show that GARG-AML outperforms current state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of fundamental network properties for advancing fraud detection, using only the adjacency matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features.

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces R2Rec, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework leveraging LLMs to improve recommendation performance and interpretability. It proposes converting user-item interactions into structured interaction-of-thoughts using a progressive masked prompting strategy and employs a two-stage training pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning methods in LLMs excel in fields with clear reasoning traces and correctness signals, but applying these directly to recommendation tasks is ineffective due to implicit user feedback and lack of reasoning supervision.

Method: R2Rec samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into structured interaction-of-thoughts through a progressive masked prompting strategy. Each thought represents stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction context. The method uses a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement learning refines reasoning via reward signals.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms classical and LLM-based baselines with an average 10.48% improvement in HitRatio@1 and 131.81% gain over the original LLM.

Conclusion: R2Rec effectively leverages LLMs for reasoning-enhanced recommendations, leading to significant performance improvements and enhanced interpretability by revealing decision processes.

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper introduces hdl2v, a dataset that translates VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 to Verilog to enhance the performance of LLMs in Verilog generation. It improves a 32 billion-parameter model by up to 23% in VerilogEvalV2 without data augmentation or knowledge distillation, and boosts a data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of publicly available Verilog code compared to software languages like Python, which limits the capability of large language models (LLMs) in hardware code generation.

Method: hdl2v is created by translating three other hardware description languages - VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 - into Verilog. This dataset is then used to improve the Verilog generation capabilities of a 32 billion-parameter open-weight model, enhancing its performance on VerilogEvalV2. Additionally, it is utilized in a data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach.

Result: The use of hdl2v improved the performance of the 32 billion-parameter model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2 without data augmentation or knowledge distillation. Furthermore, it enhanced a data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%.

Conclusion: hdl2v effectively increases the amount of human-written Verilog data, thereby improving the performance of LLMs in Verilog generation. The analysis of the dataset suggests potential areas for future work to further enhance performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages

Motivation: Despite its ubiquity in engineering, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little attention in the physics-informed machine learning literature, particularly regarding neural network discretizations of solutions.

Method: The paper uses a neural network discretization of the eigenfunction, combined with a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called the 'Rayleigh quotient' and a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure, to find eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenfunctions.

Result: This method is effective for finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. It also highlights the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating solutions to partial differential equations.

Conclusion: The combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective, Gram-Schmidt procedure, and neural network discretization offers unique advantages for handling continuous eigenvalue problems, as demonstrated through various examples from engineering mechanics.

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine Learning algorithms by benchmarking universal and gate-specific techniques for simulating layers of gates on quantum state vectors.

Method: Numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state vectors. Develop TQml Simulator that employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.

Result: TQml Simulator outperforms Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold depending on various factors including circuit, number of qubits, batch size of input data, and hardware used.

Conclusion: Optimal simulation method for a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved; tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of the esports and multiplayer online gaming community
has highlighted the critical importance of evaluating the Most Valuable Player
(MVP). The establishment of an explainable and practical MVP evaluation method
is very challenging. In our study, we specifically focus on play-by-play data,
which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We
aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework,
denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses
feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP
ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we
optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective
of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through
validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and
implemented online deployment in the industry.

TL;DR: This paper introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing that overcomes limitations in previous DNA-chemistry focused studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous software tools were mainly designed with a focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited their current usability, thus there is a need for a proper open-source tool.

Method: The study developed ChemReservoir, a general open-source framework for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs. It was evaluated using various cycle-based reservoir topologies.

Result: ChemReservoir demonstrated stable performance across a range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

Conclusion: ChemReservoir addresses the limitations in previous studies by ensuring enhanced testing, evaluation, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key

*Osayamen Jonathan Aimuyo,Byungsoo Oh,Rachee Singh*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: FlashDMoE is a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) operator that significantly improves the performance of MoE models by enhancing GPU utilization, reducing latency, and improving throughput. It achieves this through a single persistent GPU kernel and efficient data transfers, showing substantial performance gains over current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations in existing MoE model implementations such as low GPU utilization, high latency overhead, and inability to leverage task locality.

Method: Developed FlashDMoE, a fully GPU-resident MoE operator which fuses expert computation and inter-GPU communication into a single persistent GPU kernel. This allows fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, thus eliminating launch overheads and idle gaps. Also introduced payload-efficient data transfers.

Result: On evaluation with an 8-H100 GPU node, FlashDMoE showed up to 6x lower latency, 57x higher throughput, 4x better weak scaling efficiency, and 9x higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Principled GPU kernel-hardware co-design is crucial for maximizing the performance of large-scale distributed ML workloads.

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

TL;DR: Spore.fun is an experiment enabling autonomous breeding and evolution of on-chain AI agents, potentially achieving Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) in decentralized systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current closed system simulations for replicating OEE have failed to sustain continuous novelty. There is a need for 'open' systems that interact with their environment to achieve sustained OEE.

Method: Deploying large language model-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments, allowing them to operate autonomously without human oversight, control social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, and interact with blockchain-based financial networks and human social media.

Result: A detailed case study of Spore.fun reveals agent behaviors and evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology, sparking discussion on the potential of open ALife systems to achieve OEE.

Conclusion: On-chain agents in permissionless computational substrates, driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, may finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

*Mengda Ji,Genjiu Xu,Liying Wang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper addresses the credit assignment problem in cooperative MARL by proposing CORA, a method that evaluates coalitional advantages through marginal contributions and decomposes them using cooperative game theory, leading to better performance especially in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit assignment in cooperative MARL often results in suboptimal policy updates due to neglecting distinct agent contributions. Many methods lack coalition-level analysis.

Method: CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes them using the core solution from cooperative game theory with random coalition sampling to reduce computational overhead.

Result: Experiments on various games and benchmarks show that CORA outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.

Conclusion: Coalition-aware credit assignment is crucial for improving MARL performance.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper presents HoAs-PALN, an algorithm for efficient post-disaster environmental information collection using adaptive dimensionality reduction and local Nash equilibrium game to improve scheduling among UAVs, workers, and vehicles. Experiments show it improves task completion rates significantly over baselines while making quick online decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural disasters cause significant losses, and timely acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is crucial for rescue operations. Current sensing technologies face challenges like weak adaptability, insufficient specialized capabilities, and limited practicality.

Method: HoAs-PALN uses adaptive dimensionality reduction in the matching process (transforming a five-dimensional process into two three-dimensional processes) and a local Nash equilibrium game with softmax function optimization and a determination mechanism to enhance scheduling decision performance.

Result: Compared to baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL, MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%, and 14.03% respectively, with each online scheduling decision taking less than 10 seconds.

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN effectively enhances the efficiency of post-disaster environmental information collection through improved scheduling among heterogeneous multi-agents.

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了一种适应性异步LLM代理，该代理不仅决定说什么，还决定什么时候说。通过在线Mafia游戏数据集评估，结果显示该代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当。尽管在消息内容上存在差异，但其发言行为模式与人类相似。此工作为将LLMs集成到现实的人类群体环境中铺平了道路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLMs主要应用于同步通信中，而在许多真实场景中（如群聊、在线团队会议或社交游戏），通信是异步的，且没有明确的轮流发言概念。因此，何时发言成为参与者决策的重要部分，这促使研究者开发一种能够适应异步环境的LLM代理。

Method: 研究者开发了一个适应性异步LLM代理，该代理可以决定何时以及说什么。为了评估该代理的表现，他们收集了一个独特的在线Mafia游戏数据集，其中包含人类玩家和异步代理。然后对代理的游戏表现及其融入人类玩家的能力进行了分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，该异步代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类玩家相当。此外，代理在决定何时发言的行为模式上与人类相似，但在消息内容上存在一些差异。

Conclusion: 本研究成功开发并验证了一个适应性异步LLM代理，为将LLMs集成到更真实的异步人类群体环境中奠定了基础。未来的研究可以通过使用提供的数据和代码进一步探索更复杂的异步通信场景。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors explore vulnerabilities in Federated Learning using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and demonstrate gradient inversion attacks that can compromise user privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and expose potential privacy risks in PEFT methods used in Federated Learning, particularly focusing on the adapter-based fine-tuning mechanism.

Method: The authors investigate how a maliciously designed pretrained model and adapter modules could lead to privacy breaches. They perform gradient inversion attacks on adapter gradients to reconstruct local data samples of users.

Result: Through extensive experiments, they successfully retrieve a large batch of fine-tuning images with high fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of their attack.

Conclusion: This work emphasizes the necessity for developing privacy-preserving mechanisms in PEFT approaches and suggests multiple future research directions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

TL;DR: An antibody binding benchmarking framework AbBiBench is introduced, which evaluates antibody design potential by considering antibody-antigen complexes. It curates 9 datasets with 155,853 antibodies and compares 14 protein models, finding structure-conditioned inverse folding models perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing antibody evaluation strategies only focus on the antibody alone and its similarity to natural ones, but they don't consider the functional unit of an antibody-antigen complex.

Method: AbBiBench considers an antibody-antigen complex as a functional unit and evaluates the potential of an antibody design by measuring protein model's likelihood on the complex. They curated 9 datasets and compared 14 protein models using correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values.

Result: Structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks.

Conclusion: AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework that can facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

### [243] [The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515)
*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 在医疗领域，不同形式的数据可以反映单一的生理状态。通过潜在空间假设（Latent Space Hypothesis），可以将这些数据看作是从一个统一的、分层组织的流形中投影出来的。此框架有助于个性化诊断、纵向监测和定制治疗，并推动临床实践从基于可能误导性的标签分类转向对每个人独特轨迹的导航。然而，仍存在诸如偏差放大、罕见疾病的数据稀缺性、隐私问题以及相关性和因果性之间的区别等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据种类繁多且看似不同，但许多都编码了关于单一基础生理状态的汇聚信息。因此，需要一种方法来整合和解释这些异构数据，以更准确地理解疾病的进程和个体健康状态。

Method: 采用潜在空间假设（Latent Space Hypothesis）的方法，将每个观测值视为从统一的、分层组织的流形中的投影。在这个学习到的几何表示中，个人健康状况占据一个点，疾病进展描绘出一条轨迹，而治疗干预对应于一个定向向量。

Result: 该框架揭示了子轨迹和患者特定的变化方向，为个性化诊断、纵向监测和定制治疗提供了定量依据。它使临床实践能够远离基于可能误导性标签的分组，转而朝着导航每个人的唯一轨迹发展。

Conclusion: 尽管存在诸如偏差放大、罕见疾病的数据稀缺性、隐私问题以及相关性和因果性之间的区别等挑战，规模感知编码器、基于纵向数据流的持续学习和基于扰动的验证提供了可行的前进路径。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

### [244] [Robust Moment Identification for Nonlinear PDEs via a Neural ODE Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05245)
*Shaoxuan Chen,Su Yang,Panayotis G. Kevrekidis,Wei Zhu*

Main category: nlin.PS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经ODE的数据驱动框架，用于从由PDE控制的系统中学习降阶矩动力学。该方法在数据有限和不规则采样情况下仍能稳健地学习，并在闭合模型未知的情况下也能有效逼近未闭合的矩动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的导数基础方法（如SINDy）需要密集采样的数据且对噪声敏感，因此需要一种更稳健的方法来从稀疏或不规则的时间序列中学习矩动力学。

Method: 利用神经ODE直接建模矩轨迹，通过非线性薛定谔方程作为应用平台准确恢复治理矩动力学。对于没有解析闭合的系统，引入了基于Stiefel流形优化的数据驱动坐标变换策略，以发现低维表示中的闭合矩动力学。此外，在闭合模型未知的情况下（如Fisher-KPP反应扩散系统），神经ODE仍能有效逼近未闭合的矩动力学。

Result: 在有闭合模型的情况下，该框架可以准确恢复矩动力学；在没有闭合模型的情况下，神经ODE能够有效逼近未闭合的矩动力学，并且相比物理专家推导的ODE模型具有更好的外推精度。该方法在数据有限和不规则采样情况下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 神经ODE框架是一种强大而灵活的工具，适用于学习复杂PDE控制系统的可解释、低维矩动力学。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

Conclusion: The work reveals deep connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence, advancing both generative AI and optical physics.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

Motivation: To improve biological plausibility and dynamics of neural network models by adopting a grid-based structure.

Method: Utilize a grid-based structure where neurons interact with closest neighbors, combined with the Izhikevich model for simulation.

Result: Achieves computationally efficient and biologically accurate simulations that can aid in neural network development, large scale simulations, and neuroscience research.

Conclusion: The adaptation of the Izhikevich model with the GAIN approach improves model dynamics and accuracy, making it specialized and efficient.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN

in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate

TL;DR: POSSM 是一种新的混合架构，结合了跨注意力模块和循环状态空间模型，能够在神经活动解码中实现快速因果在线预测，并通过多数据集预训练实现高效泛化。在多种任务中，POSSM 的解码精度与最先进的 Transformer 相当，但推断成本仅为后者的一小部分（最高快 9 倍）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时解码神经活动在神经科学和神经技术应用中至关重要，但传统方法虽然快速轻量，却难以泛化到未见数据；而基于 Transformer 的方法虽然泛化性能强，但计算需求大，不适合低资源或实时场景。因此需要一种既能保证速度又能兼顾泛化的解决方案。

Method: POSSM 结合了跨注意力模块和循环状态空间模型 (SSM) 骨干网络，通过多数据集预训练实现对新会话、个体和任务的有效泛化。其设计支持快速因果在线预测，并能扩展到临床应用如手写和语音解码。

Result: POSSM 在猴子运动任务的皮层内解码中表现出色，并且在人类手写和语音解码任务中也有良好表现。预训练使用猴子运动皮层记录提高了人类手写任务的解码性能，展示了跨物种迁移的潜力。此外，POSSM 的解码精度与最先进的 Transformer 相当，但推断速度快得多（GPU 上最高快 9 倍）。

Conclusion: POSSM 提供了一种有前途的方法，可以在实时闭环应用中训练神经解码器时平衡精度、推断速度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

TL;DR: The paper presents an expansion-based approach for Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). This method is extended to handle multistage robust discrete optimization problems and embedded in an optimization framework. Experimental results show superior performance over existing solvers in certain cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an alternative solution paradigm for QIP beyond the search-based methods currently explored, by introducing an expansion-based approach adapted from QBF solving techniques.

Method: An expansion-based approach for QIP is introduced, utilizing Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR). The methodology is further extended to address multistage robust discrete optimization problems with linear constraints and embedded within an optimization framework.

Result: The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Additionally, it achieves significant performance gains compared to state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF when modeling problems with linear constraints.

Conclusion: The expansion-based approach for QIP using CEGAR shows promise, particularly for certain problem instances. It offers a competitive alternative to search-based methods and extends the capabilities of QIP to multistage robust discrete optimization problems.

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the question of how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies in the context of responsible AI.

Method: Introduced a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries over data. Defined four notions of trustworthiness: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and Almost Trustworthy. Analyzed the relations between these notions and their composition under logical operations.

Result: Provided a computational tool to check the trustworthiness of complex systems copied from an original with known behavior.

Conclusion: This work aims to offer a method to ensure the trustworthiness of copied systems in AI, contributing to responsible AI practices.

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address costly data collection and policy deployment in single-agent or multi-agent reinforcement learning settings by minimizing burn-in costs and policy switching/communication costs.

Method: Propose two novel model-free RL algorithms named Q-EarlySettled-LowCost for single-agent RL and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost for federated RL. These algorithms aim to achieve near-optimal regret while maintaining low burn-in costs that scale linearly with states (S) and actions (A), and logarithmic policy switching or communication costs.

Result: Achieve the best near-optimal regret among known model-free RL/FRL algorithms, low burn-in cost scaling linearly with S and A, and logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, provide gap-dependent theoretical guarantees for regret and switching/communication costs.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms represent a significant advancement in minimizing costs associated with burn-in, policy switching, and communication in both single-agent and federated reinforcement learning settings.

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Gaussian Process (GP) regression with distributional encoding (DE) for categorical variables is proposed, leading to state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling categorical input variables in Gaussian Process regression remains challenging. Existing methods like target encoding have limitations.

Method: Propose a generalization of target encoding based on distributional encoding (DE). Utilize all samples of the target variable for a category and build upon results on characteristic kernels for probability distributions, including maximum mean discrepancy and Wasserstein distance.

Result: Empirically validated approach demonstrates state-of-the-art predictive performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Distributional encoding (DE) provides an effective method for handling categorical variables in GP regression, complementing recent advances in Bayesian optimization.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most methods for inferring cause-effect relationships are limited to scalar random variables, but many domains require analyzing causal units as groups of variables.

Method: Extends nonlinear additive noise models to random vectors with a two-step approach: infer causal order among vectors then perform model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order.

Result: Demonstrated strong performance in simulations and successfully applied to real-world assembly line data.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively infers cause-effect relationships among groups of variables, advancing causal analysis in various domains.

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Result: 当至少存在三个治疗臂时，简单的自适应设计在统计学上更有效率，能够普遍且严格地优于非自适应完全随机化试验。

Conclusion: 在最佳臂识别问题中，自适应设计比非自适应设计具有更高的效率，因此忽略自适应选项而选择非自适应试验是不可取的。

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

TL;DR: A new AI-driven framework cGSA is introduced to enhance gene set analysis by incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization, showing superior performance in interpreting genomic data of diseases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GSA methods lack clinical context and often produce redundant or irrelevant results, which requires extensive manual effort to interpret and reduces reliability and reproducibility.

Method: cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to prioritize pathways that are both statistically significant and biologically meaningful.

Result: Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases shows that cGSA outperforms baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased precision and interpretability. Case studies in melanoma and breast cancer demonstrate its potential for uncovering context-specific insights.

Conclusion: cGSA enhances the interpretation of genomic data by incorporating clinical context, providing more precise and interpretable results.

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

### [259] [Diffusion Transformer-based Universal Dose Denoising for Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04467)
*Yuzhen Ding,Jason Holmes,Hongying Feng,Martin Bues,Lisa A. McGee,Jean-Claude M. Rwigema,Nathan Y. Yu,Terence S. Sio,Sameer R. Keole,William W. Wong,Steven E. Schild,Jonathan B. Ashman,Sujay A. Vora,Daniel J. Ma,Samir H. Patel,Wei Liu*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: To address the challenge of accurate yet fast dose calculation in intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for head and neck cancer, a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed to enhance low-statistics Monte Carlo dose maps. This model not only met high accuracy requirements but also demonstrated strong generalizability across multiple disease sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is sensitive to anatomical changes necessitating frequent adaptations through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART). To enable fast and accurate dose calculations, there is a need to reduce Monte Carlo simulation times without sacrificing accuracy, leading to the proposition of denoising low-statistics MC dose maps.

Method: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed. It was trained using IMPT plans and 3D CT images from 80 head and neck patients, generating both noisy and high-statistics dose maps via MCsquare. The data were preprocessed into uniform chunks, normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. The model was tested on cases from different cancer types and evaluated using MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH indices.

Result: The model achieved mean absolute errors (MAEs) between 0.120 Gy[RBE] and 0.376 Gy[RBE] across different cancer sites with 3D Gamma passing rates exceeding 92% (3%/2mm). The dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices closely matched the ground truth for clinical target volumes and organs at risk.

Conclusion: The diffusion transformer-based denoising framework successfully enables fast, high-quality dose generation in IMPT. Despite being trained solely on head and neck data, it demonstrates excellent generalization capabilities across various disease sites.

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

*Sydney Anuyah*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: This paper uses the National Crime Victimization Survey data from 1992 to 2022, employing logistic regression models to analyze how socioeconomic and demographic factors influence the type of crime (violent vs property) victims experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how income, education, employment, and demographic factors affect the likelihood of experiencing violent versus property crime.

Method: Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models evaluated by F1-score. Two groups of models are used: 'Group A' focusing on socioeconomic drivers and 'Group B' adding demographic factors such as age, gender, race, and marital status.

Result: Higher income and education decrease the odds of violent relative to property crime. Men, younger individuals, and racial minorities face higher risks of violent crime. Suburban models show the best predictive performance, while rural crime remains less predictable with current factors.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for targeted interventions, including educational investments in urban areas and economic support in rural communities, along with demographic-aware prevention strategies.

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores how agentic AI systems intensify challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms and proposes approaches for adapting institutional structures and designing agent oversight compatible with public sector constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intensified challenges posed by the introduction of agentic AI systems to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms, which rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous, integrated supervision.

Method: A mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles to evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet five essential governance dimensions for responsible agent deployment.

Result: Agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination.

Conclusion: Proposes approaches that adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight compatible with public sector constraints.

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

Motivation: 质疑给予AI模型第一修正案保护的合理性和必要性，强调这种保护可能带来的负面后果。

Method: 通过分析AI模型输出与传统言论的区别，探讨第一修正案保护的适用性，并评估其对言论自由基本目的的影响。

Result: 指出赋予AI模型第一修正案保护将阻碍政府有效监管这些技术的能力，可能导致虚假信息的传播和其他危害。

Conclusion: 扩展第一修正案权利至AI模型不仅无法促进言论自由的目的，反而会对社会造成损害，因此不应给予AI模型此类保护。

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

### [263] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how watermarking techniques for large language models affect truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness. It identifies two degradation patterns and proposes Alignment Resampling (AR) to restore alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Watermarking techniques significantly impact the output quality of LLMs, but their effects on truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness have not been thoroughly examined.

Method: The paper systematically analyzes two popular watermarking approaches (Gumbel and KGW) across four aligned LLMs. It proposes Alignment Resampling (AR), an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore alignment.

Result: Experimental results confirm that AR successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches while maintaining strong watermark detectability.

Conclusion: The work reveals the critical balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show great potential but current benchmarks focus on STEM, ignoring Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). To address this, HSSBench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages. It includes over 13,000 samples across six categories, revealing significant challenges even for advanced models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the gap in current benchmarks for MLLMs which mainly emphasize general knowledge and vertical reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while neglecting the distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences.

Method: The authors introduce HSSBench, a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks in multiple languages including the six official languages of the United Nations. They also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS scenarios involving collaboration between domain experts and automated agents.

Result: HSSBench contains over 13,000 carefully designed samples covering six key categories. The benchmarking of more than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench shows that it poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The conclusion drawn is that HSSBench can inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities of MLLMs, particularly their capacity to internalize and connect knowledge across different fields.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Motivation: 目前对于句子嵌入的内部结构知之甚少，尽管可以通过余弦相似度等方法比较这些嵌入，但其特征不具人类可解释性。

Method: 提出一种新方法，利用词典学习对词级表示进行机械分解，分析池化如何将这些特征压缩成句子表示，并评估句子嵌入中的潜在特征。

Result: 获得了关于句子嵌入空间内部运作的一些有趣见解，例如许多语义和句法方面在线性编码在嵌入中。

Conclusion: 此方法将词级机械可解释性与句子级分析结合，使得更透明和可控的表示成为可能。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

Method: 使用新引入的基准测试对55个公开可用的LLMs进行评估，该基准涵盖11个判别性和生成性任务。通过多维度分析，研究各种影响性能的因素。

Result: 许多模型在生成任务上表现不佳，较小的微调模型通常在所有任务中表现更好。预训练和指令微调中接触马耳他语是影响性能的最重要因素。微调相比提示方法具有更高的初始成本，但能带来更好的性能和更低的推理成本。

Conclusion: 需要更包容的语言技术，研究者在处理低资源语言时应考虑更传统的语言建模方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

Method: 对人类规模的Transformer语言模型进行测试，使用专门构建的合成基准来评估模型对罕见的英语LET-ALONE结构的形式和意义的知识。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义上的样本效率存在不对称性，而这种不对称性在人类语言学习者中不存在。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

in text for SemEval-2025 Task 11, Subtask A: Multi-label Emotion Detection. We
focus on predicting the perceived emotions of the speaker from a given text
snippet, labeling it with emotions such as joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise,
and disgust. Our approach does not require additional model training and only
uses an ensemble of models to predict emotions. EmoRAG achieves results
comparable to the best performing systems, while being more efficient,
scalable, and easier to implement.

### [270] [Is It JUST Semantics? A Case Study of Discourse Particle Understanding in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04534)
*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) can somewhat differentiate broad categories of the discourse particle 'just', but fail to grasp finer nuances, showing a limitation in understanding such linguistic elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the capacity of LLMs in understanding and distinguishing the fine-grained senses of the English discourse particle 'just', which is vital for shaping text meaning but presents challenges due to its polyfunctional nature.

Method: Using data carefully crafted and labeled by expert linguists, the study examines how well LLMs can discern the various nuanced meanings of 'just'.

Result: LLMs demonstrate an ability to distinguish between broader semantic categories of 'just', yet they encounter difficulties capturing more subtle and complex nuances.

Conclusion: There exists a notable gap in LLMs' comprehension of discourse particles like 'just', indicating limitations in their handling of linguistic subtleties.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

### [271] [SSA-COMET: Do LLMs Outperform Learned Metrics in Evaluating MT for Under-Resourced African Languages?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04557)
*Senyu Li,Jiayi Wang,Felermino D. M. A. Ali,Colin Cherry,Daniel Deutsch,Eleftheria Briakou,Rui Sousa-Silva,Henrique Lopes Cardoso,Pontus Stenetorp,David Ifeoluwa Adelani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated machine translation evaluation dataset for 13 African language pairs, and introduces improved metrics SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE. Experiments show these models surpass AfriCOMET and rival the best LLMs, especially for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine translation evaluation metrics have limitations in covering under-resourced African languages and perform poorly in low-resource settings. Recent efforts like AfriCOMET still face challenges such as small evaluation sets, lack of tailored training data, and inconsistent performance on extremely low-resource languages.

Method: The authors created SSA-MTE, a dataset with over 63,000 sentence-level annotations across 13 African language pairs. They developed two evaluation metrics: SSA-COMET (reference-based) and SSA-COMET-QE (reference-free). Additionally, they benchmarked prompting approaches using advanced LLMs.

Result: SSA-COMET outperforms AfriCOMET and is competitive with the strongest evaluated LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro), particularly on low-resource languages like Twi, Luo, and Yoruba.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE for evaluating machine translation quality in African languages, especially in low-resource scenarios. All resources are made available under open licenses to support further research.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

### [272] [Reasoning or Overthinking: Evaluating Large Language Models on Financial Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04574)
*Dimitris Vamvourellis,Dhagash Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型在零样本金融情感分析任务中，直观快速的思维模式（System 1）比缓慢审慎的思维模式（System 2）更符合人类判断，特别是在高风险金融应用领域。GPT-4o在无Chain-of-Thought提示的情况下表现最佳，说明推理并不总是提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性，包括基于推理和非推理模型的效果，并评估不同提示策略与人类标注的情感一致性。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，比较三种专有LLMs（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）在不同提示范式下的表现，这些范式模拟了系统1（快速直观）或系统2（缓慢审慎）思维，并将它们与两个较小的模型（FinBERT-Prosus、FinBERT-Tone）进行基准测试。

Result: 研究结果表明，推理无论是通过提示还是模型设计本身，都没有提高此任务的性能。最准确且最符合人类判断的模型与方法组合是无任何Chain-of-Thought提示的GPT-4o。语言复杂性和注释一致水平对性能有影响，推理可能引入过度思考，导致预测效果不佳。

Conclusion: 对于金融情感分类，快速直观的“系统1”思维方式比缓慢审慎的“系统2”推理方式更接近人类判断，挑战了更多推理总是带来更好LLM决策的默认假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [273] [SUCEA: Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval for Adversarial Fact-checking through Claim Decomposition and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04583)
*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automatic fact-checking using retrieval-augmented language models struggles with adversarial claims. This paper proposes SUCEA, a training-free method that rephrases claims to better locate supporting evidence through claim segmentation, iterative evidence retrieval and editing, and evidence aggregation. Experiments show improved retrieval and label accuracy compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability of fact-checking systems to handle adversarial claims which are intentionally designed to challenge these systems.

Method: The SUCEA framework decomposes the task into three steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction.

Result: Experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both retrieval and entailment label accuracy compared to four strong baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed SUCEA framework effectively improves the performance of fact-checking systems on adversarial claims.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

### [274] [Safe: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models via Retrospective Step-aware Formal Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04592)
*Chengwu Liu,Ye Yuan,Yichun Yin,Yan Xu,Xin Xu,Zaoyu Chen,Yasheng Wang,Lifeng Shang,Qun Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework named $Safe$ which uses formal mathematical language Lean 4 to verify the reasoning steps of large language models, significantly improving performance while providing interpretable evidence. It also introduces $FormalStep$, a benchmark with 30,809 formal statements for step correctness theorem proving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods to mitigate hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting from large language models operate as opaque boxes without providing checkable evidence for their judgments.

Method: The authors propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework called $Safe$. They articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. Additionally, they introduce $FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving.

Result: The framework $Safe$ demonstrates significant performance improvement across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence.

Conclusion: This work represents the first endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

*Takashi Wada,Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu,Takahiro Kawashima,Yuki Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new method for static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic representation is proposed, which outperforms existing models and rivals a basic Sentence Transformer model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create static word embeddings that are optimised for sentence semantic representation, as current methods may not fully capture the semantics of sentences.

Method: Extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis, and further enhance them using either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During inference, represent sentences by averaging the word embeddings.

Result: The models substantially outperform existing static models on sentence semantic tasks and even rival a basic Sentence Transformer model (SimCSE) on some datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully removes irrelevant word embedding components and adjusts vector norms based on word influence on sentence semantics.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for evaluating and improving multimodal large language models' reasoning and error refinement abilities beyond simple accuracy metrics.

Method: Introduced MMRefine, a multimodal refinement benchmark that evaluates models across six distinct error refinement scenarios and categorizes errors into six types.

Result: Experiments identified bottlenecks and factors limiting refinement performance in both open and closed MLLMs.

Conclusion: MMRefine provides insights for enhancing reasoning in multimodal large language models, with publicly available code and dataset.

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to

(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

*Ziyi Zhou,Xiaoming Zhang,Litian Zhang,Yibo Zhang,Zhenyu Guan,Chaozhuo Li,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new framework named C<sup>2</sup>EFND is proposed to detect fake news by combining the strengths of LLMs and SLMs, along with methods for lifelong learning and knowledge retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for detecting fake news either require extensive supervised training (SLMs) or lack up-to-date knowledge for accurate detection (LLMs).

Method: C<sup>2</sup>EFND framework uses collaborative learning between LLMs and SLMs. It includes a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for LLMs and a replay-based continue learning method for SLMs.

Result: Experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets show that C<sup>2</sup>EFND outperforms existing methods in detection accuracy and adaptability.

Conclusion: The C<sup>2</sup>EFND framework effectively addresses the challenges of fake news detection by leveraging both LLMs and SLMs, improving accuracy and adaptability.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a four-dimensional political learning framework to uncover LLMs' internal political states and disentangle concept confounds through interpretable representation engineering techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a misalignment between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions, and the analysis of their political opinions often relies on single-axis concepts which can lead to concept confounds.

Method: Designing a four-dimensional political learning framework, constructing a corresponding dataset for fine-grained political concept vector learning, and applying three representation engineering techniques on eight open-source LLMs.

Result: The vectors can disentangle political concept confounds, validate semantic meaning in detection tasks with good generalization and robustness, and intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a more transparent approach to understanding LLMs' political concepts and provides methods for detecting and intervening in their internal mechanisms.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), providing an LLM-centric analysis of approaches, proposing a classification framework based on three dimensions: architectural strategies, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the significant gap in existing literature regarding how different modalities connect to the language backbone in MLLMs.

Method: The method involves examining 125 MLLMs developed between 2021 and 2025, presenting a classification framework based on three key dimensions: architectural strategies for modality integration, representation learning techniques categorized as joint or coordinate representations, and training paradigms including strategies and objective functions.

Result: The result is the identification of emerging patterns in the field of MLLMs through the proposed taxonomy.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the provided taxonomy offers researchers a structured overview of current integration techniques, guiding the development of more robust multimodal integration strategies.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

*Yujun Zhou,Jiayi Ye,Zipeng Ling,Yufei Han,Yue Huang,Haomin Zhuang,Zhenwen Liang,Kehan Guo,Taicheng Guo,Xiangqi Wang,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Logical reasoning is crucial for LLMs. Current benchmarks focus on final-answer accuracy, neglecting reasoning quality. FineLogic evaluates logical reasoning in three dimensions: benchmark accuracy, soundness, and alignment. A study on supervision formats reveals natural language supervision enhances generalization while symbolic styles promote sound inference chains. Fine-tuning improves step-by-step reasoning rather than shortcut prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing benchmarks that only focus on final-answer accuracy and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation framework for logical reasoning in LLMs.

Method: Propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework assessing logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. Conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of different supervision formats (natural language and symbolic variants) during fine-tuning.

Result: Natural language supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and long-context tasks. Symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally sound and atomic inference chains. Fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through step-by-step generation.

Conclusion: FineLogic provides a rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning in LLMs. The findings suggest the importance of supervision format in shaping reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

*Martin Andrews,Sam Witteveen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new LLM-based reasoning system solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and verifying solutions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Cryptonite dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptic crossword clues are complex language tasks that require both definition understanding and wordplay reasoning. Existing systems lack a comprehensive approach to solve these puzzles effectively.

Method: The system uses three main steps: (i) hypothesizing possible answers, (ii) proposing wordplay explanations, and (iii) verifying solutions using codified reasoning steps expressed in Python.

Result: This system sets a new state-of-the-art performance benchmark on the Cryptonite dataset, which includes clues from major UK newspapers like The Times and The Telegraph.

Conclusion: The developed LLM-based reasoning system significantly improves the solving of cryptic crossword clues and provides interpretable wordplay reasoning for each proven answer.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

*Giorgio Biancini,Alessio Ferrato,Carla Limongelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the potential of LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5) for creating MCQs in education, showing that GPT-3.5 performs best but revealing educators' reluctance to adopt AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive process of manually generating MCQs by leveraging LLMs to create informative and challenging questions, giving educators control over the source text while reducing cognitive effort.

Method: Conducted a comparative analysis of three LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-3.5) by injecting knowledge into prompts rather than relying on the models' inherent knowledge, focusing on their ability to generate effective MCQs.

Result: GPT-3.5 outperformed other models in generating effective MCQs based on several metrics, though some educators remain hesitant to fully embrace AI tools.

Conclusion: LLMs hold significant potential for improving educational practices, particularly in generating MCQs, despite existing hesitations; further research can enhance their integration.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

### [283] [Verbose ListOps (VLO): Beyond Long Context -- Unmasking LLM's Reasoning Blind Spots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04907)
*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) have difficulty with nested narrative reasoning. Existing benchmarks don't adequately test this. The paper introduces Verbose ListOps, a new benchmark that creates long, coherent stories from ListOps computations to challenge LLMs on their ability to manage internal states for nested reasoning problems. Experiments show leading LLMs perform poorly on Verbose ListOps even at modest narrative lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in testing LLMs' nested narrative reasoning capability, which is crucial for real-world text interpretation.

Method: Introduced Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent stories. It forces internal computation and state management of nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results and offers fine-grained controls for both narrative size and reasoning difficulty.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) significantly drop in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths, despite easily solving raw ListOps equations.

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps and its extensible generation framework enable targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere context-window expansion, marking a critical step towards automating the world's knowledge work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过大规模模拟多语言导师-学生互动，探讨了大型语言模型在提供多语言教学反馈中的效果，发现与学生母语对齐的反馈能显著改善学习成果，尤其是在低资源语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在英语生成式反馈和教学提示方面表现出色，但其在多语言环境下的教学支持能力，特别是数学推理任务中，尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用更强的模型作为导师生成提示，较弱的模型模拟学生，探索352种实验设置，涵盖11种语言、4种最先进的大型语言模型及多种提示策略，评估语言特定反馈对学生学习增益的影响。

Result: 多语言提示可以显著提升学习成果，特别是在低资源语言中，当反馈与学生的母语一致时效果更明显。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发有效且包容的多语言、基于大型语言模型的教育工具提供了实际见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Conclusion: TALL presents a promising approach for enhancing LLM performance in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages but struggle

transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging
the LLM's capabilities while preserving linguistic features through dimension
alignment layers and custom transformers. Our experiments on Hebrew demonstrate
significant improvements over several baselines, including direct use, naive

### [287] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) produce self-reports, but only minimal examples might be considered introspection without consciousness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the extent to which the concept of introspection can be meaningfully applied to LLMs given their increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities.

Method: Presenting and critiquing two examples of apparent introspective self-report from LLMs.

Result: The first example of an LLM describing its 'creative' writing process is not valid introspection, while the second example of an LLM inferring its own temperature parameter is considered a minimal example of introspection.

Conclusion: The concept of introspection can be minimally applied to LLMs, but it is presumably not accompanied by conscious experience.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

### [288] [DiCoRe: Enhancing Zero-shot Event Detection via Divergent-Convergent LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05128)
*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe is a divergent-convergent reasoning framework for zero-shot Event Detection, which decouples the task using Dreamer and Grounder, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot Event Detection in specialized domains is challenging due to complex event ontology, domain-specific triggers, and limitations of Large Language Models.

Method: Proposes DiCoRe framework with Dreamer for open-ended event discovery and Grounder for convergent reasoning. LLM-Judge verifies outputs for high precision.

Result: Outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines across six datasets and nine LLMs, achieving consistent 4-7% average F1 gains.

Conclusion: DiCoRe establishes itself as a strong zero-shot ED framework.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

*Chih-Kai Yang,Neo Ho,Yi-Jyun Lee,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of how large audio-language models (LALMs) perceive and recognize auditory attributes, revealing that attribute information generally decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and resolving attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Additionally, LALMs rely on querying auditory inputs rather than aggregating information in hidden states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To interpret the behavior and improve the performance of LALMs by understanding their internal mechanisms for perceiving and recognizing auditory attributes.

Method: Apply vocabulary projection on three state-of-the-art LALMs to track the evolution of attribute information across layers and token positions, analyzing the model's reliance on querying auditory inputs versus aggregating information in hidden states.

Result: Attribute information generally decreases with layer depth when recognition fails; resolving attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy; LALMs heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of aggregating necessary information in hidden states.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into auditory attribute processing in LALMs, offering a method to enhance their performance and paving the way for future improvements.

presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and

decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: In this paper, the authors propose Knowledgeable-r1 to solve the problem of current RAG systems over-relying on retrieved contexts. Through joint sampling and multi policy distributions, it promotes the integration of parametric and contextual knowledge in large language models. Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 improves robustness and reasoning accuracy, especially in counterfactual scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems overly emphasize retrieved contexts, which may lead to reliance on inaccurate sources and ignore the model's inherent knowledge when handling misleading or excessive information.

Method: The proposed method, Knowledgeable-r1, uses joint sampling and defines multi policy distributions in knowledge capability exploration to encourage large language models to self-integrate parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Experiments indicate that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly boosts robustness and reasoning accuracy in both parameter and contextual conflict tasks as well as general RAG tasks. It outperforms baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios and shows consistent improvements across RAG tasks.

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1 effectively addresses the imbalance issue in current RAG systems and enhances performance in various tasks, particularly in counterfactual reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

*Bhavik Chandna,Zubair Bashir,Procheta Sen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze and locate bias-related computations within Large Language Models like GPT-2 and Llama2, finding them highly localized. Removing these components reduces biased outputs but also impacts other NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how social, demographic, and gender biases are structurally represented in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-2 and Llama2, likely due to the training data.

Method: Adopting a mechanistic interpretability approach, focusing on demographic and gender biases, exploring different metrics to identify internal edges responsible for biased behavior and assessing their stability, localization, and generalizability across dataset and linguistic variations through systematic ablations.

Result: Bias-related computations are highly localized, concentrated in a small subset of layers and change across fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Removing these components affects not only biased outputs but also other NLP tasks like named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability judgment.

Conclusion: The study concludes that bias-related computations in LLMs are localized and interconnected with other important components, making their removal impactful on various NLP tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

### [292] [ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167)
*Yeonseok Jeong,Jinsu Kim,Dohyeon Lee,Seung-won Hwang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ECoRAG is a new framework that improves LLM performance in ODQA tasks by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring correct evidence for answer generation and sufficient evidence through additional retrieval if necessary. It outperforms existing compression methods, is cost-efficient by reducing latency and token usage, and its code is available online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing context compression methods for RAG do not effectively filter out non-evidential information, limiting the performance of LLMs in ODQA tasks.

Method: ECoRAG framework compresses retrieved documents based on evidentiality to ensure answer generation is supported by correct evidence. It also checks if the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, retrieving more until sufficient evidence is gathered.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ECoRAG enhances LLM performance on ODQA tasks, surpassing existing compression methods. It is also highly cost-efficient by minimizing token usage and reducing latency.

Conclusion: ECoRAG successfully improves LLM performance in ODQA by focusing on evidentiality-based context compression and ensuring sufficient evidence, while being cost-efficient.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large-scale neural language models can perform in-context counterfactual reasoning, which is demonstrated in a synthetic linear regression task requiring noise abduction. Self-attention, model depth, and pre-training data diversity drive performance in Transformers, with potential implications for counterfactual story generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the ability of large-scale neural language models to perform in-context counterfactual reasoning, specifically focusing on predicting consequences of changes under hypothetical scenarios.

Method: A well-defined synthetic setup involving a linear regression task that requires noise abduction was used. The study focused on inferring and copying contextual noise from factual observations to achieve accurate predictions.

Result: Language models are capable of counterfactual reasoning in the controlled setup. Self-attention, model depth, and data diversity in pre-training were found to drive performance in Transformers. Additionally, Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into how counterfactual reasoning can be reduced to transformations on in-context observations for a broad class of functions. It also offers preliminary evidence for the potential of counterfactual story generation using Transformers.

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型解码器语言模型（LLMs）在生成和推理任务中取得了显著成功，但许多应用仍依赖单独的嵌入模型生成文本嵌入，这可能使系统复杂化并引入查询理解差异。为解决此限制，我们提出了一个简单的自监督方法——生成嵌入大语言模型（GEM），它使任何大型解码器LLM都能生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保持原有的文本生成和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型解码器语言模型（LLMs）在生成和推理任务中表现出色，但许多应用如检索增强生成（RAG）仍然依赖单独的嵌入模型来生成文本嵌入，这可能导致系统复杂化，并在嵌入模型和LLMs之间引入查询理解差异。

Method: 通过在文本主体中插入新的特殊标记，并通过操作注意力掩码生成文本的总结嵌入。该方法可以轻松集成到任何现有LLMs的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 将该方法应用于两个参数范围从1B到8B的流行LLM家族，在文本嵌入基准（MTEB）和NLP基准（MMLU）上评估转换后的模型。结果表明，所提出的方法显著提高了原始LLMs在MTEB上的表现，同时对MMLU的影响最小。

Conclusion: 我们的方法可以在保持LLMs原有NLP性能的同时，赋予它们最先进的文本嵌入能力。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face Knowledge Conflicts which hinder their performance. Existing approaches to mitigate these conflicts can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous contexts. The paper proposes Micro-Act, a framework that adaptively decomposes knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons to address this issue. Through experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act shows significant improvements in QA accuracy and robust performance on non-conflict questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of Knowledge Conflicts in RAG systems where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent knowledge of LLMs, leading to performance issues on downstream tasks like QA.

Method: Propose Micro-Act, a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons represented as actionable steps.

Result: Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. It also exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions.

Conclusion: Micro-Act effectively mitigates Knowledge Conflicts in RAG systems, improving QA accuracy and showing practical value in real-world applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic workflows with multiple AI agents often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal performance due to poorly designed prompts.

Method: ProRefine dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks by leveraging textual feedback from large language models without additional training or ground truth labels.

Result: ProRefine surpasses zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: ProRefine not only enhances accuracy but also allows smaller models to perform as well as larger ones, promoting efficient and scalable AI deployment.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes HTC-CLIP for Hierarchical Text Classification, combining two existing approaches through contrastive learning to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical Text Classification is crucial in many real-world applications but existing models either encode label hierarchy separately or guide it within the text encoder, capturing different yet complementary characteristics.

Method: Proposes HTC-CLIP which uses contrastive learning to learn hierarchy-aware text representation and text informed path guided hierarchy representation. It learns two sets of class probabilities during training and pools them during inference.

Result: HTC-CLIP improves Macro F1 scores by 0.99 - 2.37% on two public benchmark datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The combination of two previous approaches into one architecture through HTC-CLIP leads to improved performance in Hierarchical Text Classification.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture that extends domain-specific models to other domains with few labeled samples, using supervised fine-tuning and multilingual knowledge distillation. Experiments show a 20-23% increase in accuracy for few-shot intent detection compared to existing pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the need for an intent classifier that can generalize across different domains (channels, geographies, languages) in customer care with only a few annotations, due to the bottleneck of cross-domain data availability.

Method: The method involves developing an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture. It uses supervised fine-tuning with isotropic regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and multilingual knowledge distillation to generalize this embedder across multiple domains. A linear classifier is then added for deployment in new domains.

Result: Experiments on Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care datasets show a significant improvement in accuracy (20-23%) for few-shot intent detection compared to current state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The proposed model architecture successfully extends domain-specific models to other domains with few labeled samples, providing a practical solution for cross-domain intent classification in customer care.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的大型语言模型（LLM）遗忘方法，通过约束优化问题解决敏感、过时或专有信息的遗忘需求，使用logit-margin flattening loss和硬约束保留数据集的方法，相比现有方法更稳定高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际应用中，大型语言模型需要遗忘敏感、过时或专有的信息，但现有的遗忘方法通常会导致性能不稳定和保留数据上的性能下降。

Method: 将LLM遗忘问题表示为一个约束优化问题：通过一种新的logit-margin flattening loss实现遗忘，该损失函数显式地将输出分布驱动到指定的遗忘集合上的均匀分布；通过保留集合上的硬约束来保持保留数据的性能。这种方法无需softmax，数值上稳定且梯度不会消失。采用可扩展的原始-对偶算法解决约束问题，通过对偶变量的动力学揭示遗忘和保留之间的权衡。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，针对不同的LLM架构，该方法的表现始终与或超过最先进的基线方法，能够有效去除目标信息并保留下游效用。

Conclusion: 所提出的约束优化方法在遗忘特定信息的同时能更好地保留数据效用，相比现有方法更加稳定和高效。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes REWIRE, a method to recycle low-quality web documents through guided rewriting, increasing the representation of synthetic data in pre-training sets for large language models. Experiments show improvements across diverse tasks compared to using only filtered web data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation in the availability of high-quality texts for pre-training large language models, where data filtering often removes up to 99% of initial web scrapes.

Method: REWIRE (REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite) transforms and recycles discarded low-quality documents by enriching them, making them useful for training.

Result: Experiments at 1B, 3B, and 7B scales demonstrate improvements of 1.0, 1.3, and 2.5 percentage points respectively across 22 diverse tasks. Using mixed raw-synthetic data is more effective than having access to 2x web data.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts via REWIRE is a simple and effective approach to scale pre-training data, outperforming other methods of generating synthetic data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

TL;DR: 通过增加EOS token在交叉熵损失计算中的重要性，提出了一种简单的方法来控制自动文本摘要的长度，该方法与架构和解码算法无关，并且可以在不影响摘要质量的情况下控制生成长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制生成文本长度的方法通常需要复杂的模型更改，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 开发一种简单的方法，通过增加正确预测EOS token在交叉熵损失计算中的重要性，来控制自动文本摘要的长度。此方法与架构和解码算法无关，并且与其他推理时技术正交。

Result: 使用编码器-解码器和现代GPT风格的LLM进行测试，表明该方法可以控制生成长度，且通常不会影响摘要的质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可以在不影响摘要质量的情况下有效控制生成文本的长度，且具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of training large language models (LLMs) on unlicensed text by introducing the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text from 30 diverse sources. They validate this dataset by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs, Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, which perform competitively with LLMs trained on unlicensed text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the problems of intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns related to training LLMs on unlicensed text, the authors aim to create a high-quality, large-scale dataset of openly licensed text for LLM pretraining.

Method: The authors collected and curated the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte dataset of openly licensed text from 30 diverse sources. They then trained two 7 billion parameter LLMs, Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, on this dataset using 1 and 2 trillion tokens respectively.

Result: The two LLMs trained on the Common Pile v0.1 achieved competitive performance compared to LLMs trained on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2 7B.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 is a valuable resource for training performant LLMs while addressing intellectual property and ethical concerns. The authors released the dataset, the code used in its creation, and the training mixture and checkpoints for the Comma v0.1 models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

TL;DR: 研究人员创建了一个名为Search Arena的大规模数据集，包含超过24,000次多轮用户交互，用于分析结合网络搜索功能的大型语言模型（LLMs）的表现。通过分析发现，用户的偏好受到引用次数的影响，并且不同的信息来源对用户的吸引力不同。此外，研究还探讨了在不同场景下LLMs和结合搜索功能的LLMs的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估数据集规模有限、范围狭窄，通常局限于静态、单轮的事实核查问题，无法充分评估结合网络搜索功能的大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力。

Method: 研究人员创建了一个名为Search Arena的大规模数据集，包含超过24,000次多轮用户交互。该数据集涵盖了多样化的意图和语言，并包含了约12,000个人类偏好投票。通过分析这些数据，研究用户偏好与引用次数及信息来源的关系，并在不同场景下测试LLMs和结合搜索功能的LLMs的表现。

Result: 研究表明，用户的偏好受引用次数影响，并存在感知可信度与实际可信度之间的差距。社区驱动平台的信息源更受欢迎，而静态百科全书式的信息源并不总是合适或可靠。此外，网络搜索不会降低LLMs在非搜索场景中的表现，但在搜索场景中，仅依赖模型的参数知识会显著影响质量。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了结合网络搜索功能的LLMs在用户偏好和不同场景下的表现特点，为未来的研究提供了开放源代码的数据集和工具。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管音频-文本模型可以减少对标注数据的需求，但在存在背景声源的情况下，其性能会大幅下降，因此需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过量化和整合背景声源对分类过程的贡献来改善性能，同时无需重新训练模型。此外，分析了音频和文本嵌入之间的模态差距。

Result: 该方法提高了不同背景和信噪比条件下的分类准确性，有效缩小了音频与文本嵌入之间的模态差距，并且适用于多种最先进的原型方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效地增强音频-文本模型在多样化环境中的鲁棒性和可扩展性，解决了背景声源带来的性能下降问题。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

TL;DR: AI music generation faces challenges in personalization due to fixed datasets. This paper proposes a human-computation approach using user feedback and genetic algorithms to iteratively improve music generation models, showing an increase in user ratings with each iteration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of AI music generation models trained on fixed datasets, which struggle to provide personalized outputs based on user input.

Method: The method involves a human-computation approach where user ratings are aggregated and used as the loss function for fine-tuning a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. A genetic algorithm is employed to incorporate this user feedback into improving the model's performance.

Result: In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline, while the second iteration achieved an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that integrating user feedback through a human-computation approach can effectively enhance the performance of AI music generation models.

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs face challenges in capturing complex spatial hierarchies and enforcing intricate boundary conditions.

Method: BridgeNet uses adaptive CNN layers for local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function to enforce physical constraints.

Result: BridgeNet achieves significantly lower error metrics, faster convergence, and robust stability in high-dimensional settings compared to conventional PINN approaches.

Conclusion: This work offers a scalable and accurate solution methodology for solving FPEs with potential applications in various fields.

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to
complex system dynamics.
