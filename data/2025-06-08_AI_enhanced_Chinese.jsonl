However, creating the training dataset for their skill\nacquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires\nsignificant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks\nto learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are\nactually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful\nlearning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To\naddress this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for\nLLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target\nbehaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an\nexploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train\nthe target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.\nSpecifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively\ngenerate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to\ntrain Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's\nability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the\ncapabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving\nsubstantial performance improvements.

This strategic combination\nleverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at\napproximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and\nstabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide\nhigh-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical\nanalysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly\nenhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types\nwhile maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties.

A critical challenge for continual\nlearning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks\ndecreases as new tasks are introduced.

Our analysis focuses on sample replay and\nhighlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task\nsubspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting\ncan be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples.

We prove that the gap between the\nCL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under\na bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.\n  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL\nloss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class\ncollapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We\nfurther introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing.

However, few studies have focused on this issue in\nPartial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set\nof candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods\naddressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,\nlow-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and\nmay lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that\nexisting methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is\nimportant in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection\nmethod is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label\nrelationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity.

However, these\ngains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,\naccuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency\nsignificantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for\npoint forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,\nachieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to\naccuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or\nthree models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These\nfindings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient\nforecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in\nforecasting.

Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing\nupper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further\nreduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network\nscenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic\nchannel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into\nthe BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS\nalgorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\\%$ faster than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\\%$ of the optimal value.

A common\nsolution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,\ncurrent synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as\nmultiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category\nlabels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine\nmultiple instances within scenes.

Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets\ndemonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,\neffectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous\nemergent fake news scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new framework named C<sup>2</sup>EFND is proposed to detect fake news by combining the strengths of LLMs and SLMs, along with methods for lifelong learning and knowledge retention.", "motivation": "Current methods for detecting fake news either require extensive supervised training (SLMs) or lack up-to-date knowledge for accurate detection (LLMs).", "method": "C<sup>2</sup>EFND framework uses collaborative learning between LLMs and SLMs. It includes a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for LLMs and a replay-based continue learning method for SLMs.", "result": "Experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets show that C<sup>2</sup>EFND outperforms existing methods in detection accuracy and adaptability.", "conclusion": "The C<sup>2</sup>EFND framework effectively addresses the challenges of fake news detection by leveraging both LLMs and SLMs, improving accuracy and adaptability."}}

However, computing exact\nShapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature\ndimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic\nrandomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used\nbeing the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators\nsuch as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &\nWitter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for\nKernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework\nthat encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with\nand without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong\nnon-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our\nframework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical\nguarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing\nestimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional\ndatasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact\nShapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest\nsample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to\nenable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets.

While previous studies\nprimarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text\nmemorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion\nmodels, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in\npractical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of\ncross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on\nvision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first\nintroduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person\nimages and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and\ncross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and\nevaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts\nlearned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists\nbetween recalling information in the source and target modalities.

Among these XAI\nmethods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent\nspace to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual\nlayer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention\nrecently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to\ndetermine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature\nembeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the\noriginal models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer\n(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively\nimpact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced\nwith input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.\nTo address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable\nVision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision\ntransformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer.

Under review", "summary": "Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and\nneurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer\ninterfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional\nmethods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight\nbut often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent\nTransformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong\ngeneralization performance, but typically have much larger computational\nrequirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time\nsettings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid\narchitecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention\nmodule with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and\ncausal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to\nnew sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We\nevaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical\ndecoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical\napplications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.\nNotably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings\nimproves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the\nexciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find\nthat POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nTransformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).\nThese results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the\ngap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural\ndecoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "POSSM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u56e0\u679c\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPOSSM \u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684 Transformer \u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u65ad\u6210\u672c\u4ec5\u4e3a\u540e\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb 9 \u500d\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u7801\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5feb\u901f\u8f7b\u91cf\uff0c\u5374\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u901f\u5ea6\u53c8\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "POSSM \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b (SSM) \u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u4f1a\u8bdd\u3001\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u56e0\u679c\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u624b\u5199\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "POSSM \u5728\u7334\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u76ae\u5c42\u5185\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u5199\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528\u7334\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u76ae\u5c42\u8bb0\u5f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u5199\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cPOSSM \u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684 Transformer \u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u65ad\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u5f97\u591a\uff08GPU \u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb 9 \u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "POSSM \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u95ed\u73af\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a\ncrowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired\nmulti-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans\ndiverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around\n12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are\ninfluenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not\ndirectly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and\nactual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,\nrevealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static\nencyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess\nperformance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by\ntesting search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and\nconventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does\nnot degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,\nthe quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on\nthe model's parametric knowledge.
